== Emacs-bits github repository ==

The following github repository contains an assortment of some useful and occasionally interesting Elisp tidbits that I've written:

https://github.com/snogglethorpe/emacs-bits

They used to be included in code form on this EmacsWiki page, but were moved to Github for safety reasons.

[new:XueFuqiao:2013-05-05 23:03 UTC] Useful.  I've added it to my .emacs.

You wrote the lexical scope branch and I think that was awesome. Can you write about the history of that and the challenges involved? That would be super interesting.
