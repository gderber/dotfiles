[:AboutMe]
==About Me:==
  I use Emacs (GNU Emacs 23.3.1).
  I used to use Vim until I found Common Lisp. The need for an efficient way
  to code in lisp drove me towards Emacs. I began to be serious with Emacs. I
  once thought the keybindings were horribly arcane and difficult to understand,
  but as I progressed, I saw the beauty in them. Since then I have not looked
  back (except to wonder how I ever used Vim. And I thought Emacs was arcane...)

It seems that I cannot create a link.  The first link works, but anything else modeled after it does not. -- EricSmith

I assume you mean a link on the wiki (?).  Please provide a recipe of what you tried.  If you think there is a general problem you can report it by clicking `Problems' at the top of the page. -- DrewAdams
