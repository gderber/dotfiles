You can use built-in Emacs function `w32-shell-execute' to execute an MS Windows system function.

Library ##w32-shell-execute.el## provides command `w32-shell-execute-verb', which gives you an interface to `w32-shell-execute' that tries to make it more convenient to execute MS Windows /Explorer verbs/ that are available for the current file or directory.

And here is an alternative, for use in [[Dired]]:

<pre>
(defun w32-dired-open-explorer ()
  "Open a file in dired mode by explorer.exe as you double click it."
  (interactive)
  (let ((file-name (dired-get-file-for-visit)))
    (if (file-exists-p file-name)
	(w32-shell-execute "open" file-name nil 1))))

;; Bind it to `o' in dired mode.
(define-key dired-mode-map "o" 'w32-dired-open-explorer)

</pre>
