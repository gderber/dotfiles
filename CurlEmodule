There is a small emodule, an extension written in C, for XEmacs which provides libcurl bindings.

* [https://github.com/myrkraverk/xemacs-libcurl The code on GitHub].
* [http://www.myrkraverk.com/blog/2015/05/xemacs-binding-for-libcurl/ Blog with demonstration.]

It is used like this:

  (load-module "curl")
  
  (setq curl (curl-easy-init))
  (curl-easy-setopt curl 'curlopt-url "http://curl.haxx.se/")
  (curl-easy-setopt curl 'curlopt-writefunction (lambda (s a)
  						(with-temp-buffer
  						  (insert s)
  						  (append-to-buffer "*curl*"
  								 (point-min)
  								 (point-max))
  						(length s))))
  (curl-easy-perform curl)
