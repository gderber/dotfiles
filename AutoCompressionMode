This modes allow you to edit compressed files. It uncompresses and
compresses files on the fly, so the user can use compressed files
transparently. To check it out, use `M-x auto-compression-mode' and
open a file compressed with gzip (<code>.gz</code>), bzip2 (<code>.bz2</code>) or compress (<code>.Z</code>).
It's important that you end the filename with one of the above named
extensions, because that's what Emacs uses to recognize that the file's
compressed.

Later, consider adding this to your ~/.emacs file:

    (auto-compression-mode 1)

== dz files ==
<code>.dz</code> files are used by RFC 2229 <code>dictd</code> servers.
(On a [[Debian]] system such files are under <code>/usr/share/dictd</code>.) 
They're gzip format, but arranged to allow random access, ie. direct access to chunks in the middle of the file instead of always reading from the start.

Emacs 22 has support for <code>.dz</code> in auto compression mode, so you can visit a <code>.dict.dz</code> and look at the whole thing instead of doing an actual <code>dict</code> search (see CategoryInterface for <code>dict</code> searches).  You can get the same in Emacs 21 by copying the <code>jka-compr-compression-info-list</code> entry from Emacs 22, or with a little package

* [http://user42.tuxfamily.org/jka-compr-dictzip/index.html jka-compr-dictzip.el] -- <code>.dz</code> for Emacs21/XEmacs21

And <code>.dict</code> files are UTF-8, so

    (add-to-list 'file-coding-system-alist '("\\.dict\\'" . utf-8))

(Preferring <code>add-to-list</code> over <code>modify-coding-system-alist</code> as the latter fails in XEmacs 21 if you don't have utf-8 from MuleUCS or similar.)

In Ubuntu 10.10 I have install via their repository 23.1.1 . It seems at least since this (ubuntu) release I can 
no longer open .gz files in dired. They fail with (wrong-type-argument characterp "gzip")
I toggled on debug and the full output is:

Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument characterp "gzip")
  signal(wrong-type-argument (characterp "gzip"))

It works well in Ubuntu 12.10 (GNU Emacs 24.2.50) --XueFuqiao
