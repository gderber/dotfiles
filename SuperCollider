[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider Supercollider] has a nice emacs mode for working with the supercollider server and editing supercollider code

The mode itself should come with Supercollider, but as others have noted, it's a bit old.

== Third-Party Extensions ==
''[Supercollider] has an Emacs mode, but unfortunately it has bitrotted. This isn’t surprising – they’ve got a great IDE now. Still, you’ll pry Emacs from my COLD DEAD HANDS.''

SuperCollider is packaged with an Emacs mode, but it does not appear to be actively maintained. There is set of extensions available on the [http://melpa.milkbox.net/ MELPA] package repo that aim to make the mode feel more modern.

* MELPA : <code>M-x package-install sclang-extensions</code>
* [https://github.com/chrisbarrett/sclang-extensions GitHub]
* [https://chrisbarrettnz.wordpress.com/2013/04/28/supercollider-tools-for-emacs/ Blogged]

This package includes a number of extensions and improvements:
* better auto-completion
* minibuffer documentation using Eldoc
* C-z switches between the Post buffer and Workspace
* display documentation and help in w3m, rather than launching the SC Help app
* fixes application and documentation paths on OS X
