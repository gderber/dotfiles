I started to use emacs in 2002. I really like it very much, I simply can't have enough of it. I find elisp beautiful (especially with the cl extension).

Welcome to the wiki.

[[LispLanguage|LISP]] is beautiful. EmacsLisp is no Top Model, but is fun to be with ;-).  Prolog, [[Haskell]], and [[Scheme]] are pretty and smart.  [[WikiPedia:Lambda calculus|Lambda calculus]] and [[WikiPedia:Combinatory logic|combinatory logic]] are sublimely --- almost divinely --- ''gorgeous''.
