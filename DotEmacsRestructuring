Currently I'm in the process of restructuring my InitFile(along with my whole ~/elisp directory). So that I don't mess up my current configuration I created a directory ~/restructure and work on my InitFile and other EmacsLisp files there and then test it with the shell command:

  $ HOME=~/restructure emacs

Or one could write a small shell script to do the same:

 #!/bin/sh
 #
 # nemacs - for new emacs setup
 #
 export HOME=~/restructure
 emacs --no-site-file $@
