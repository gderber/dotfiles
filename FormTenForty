'''Form 1040''' is for filing a U.S. individual federal income tax return.
Taxes for the previous year need to submitted to the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) by April 15.

Here's an Emacs library with functions that can estimate your expected
tax obligation or rate.  It does not consider deductions, credits or
any other adjustments.

The library can only be expected to work in the last year it was
updated, since the US Congress changes the tax schedule on an annual
basis.  ''Use at your own risk!''

See InstallingPackages for how to installing a Lisp file.

* Lisp:1040tt.el

Add the following to your InitFile to use it.

{{{
(autoload '1040tt-income-tax "1040tt"
  "Compute tax for INCOME when filing as STATUS.

\(fn income status)"
  'interactive)

(autoload '1040tt-income-tax-estimate "1040tt"
  "Compute tax for INCOME when filing as STATUS without tax tables."

\(fn income status)"
  'interactive)

(autoload '1040tt-tax-rate "1040tt"
  "Display tax rate for INCOME when filing as STATUS.

\(fn income status)"
  'interactive)

(autoload '1040tt-tax-level "1040tt"
  "Display income level for INCOME when filing as STATUS.

\(fn income status)"
  'interactive)
}}}

Many of the following commands ask for a "Filing status".  This must
be one of the following:

* `filing-jointly'
* `filing-separately'
* `head-of-household'
* `single'
