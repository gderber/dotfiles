To declare an edit '''minor''', check the box next to "This change is a
minor edit", before hitting the '''Save''' button.

Examples of minor edits include

* typos,
* small fixes,
* and repetitive, "humdrum" changes to multiple files.

In general, a minor edit is any change that you don't want to draw
attention to, or clutter the RecentChanges page with. Overall, it is
/your/ judgment.

Deleting and creating a page is generally considered a major
edit. When a deletion and creation constitutes a page /renaming/,
updating the links to the deleted page could be hidden. See
IfYouRenameOrDeletePages.

As with major edits, provide a short summary describing a minor
edit. By default, summaries for [::MinorEdits] are hidden from the
RecentChanges page, but can be displayed by clicking the link [EmacsWiki:action=rc;showedit=1 Include
minor changes]. The link shows the recent major and minor edits as if
there was no distinction.

The /purpose/ of having minor edits is to display the more important
changes and remove the clutter of less-important changes. It is good
etiquette to avoid abusing the system to hide major changes as minor
changes or "skywriting" minor changes as major.
