I am Christof Harper- [::koyote] on freenode.net

I have been using assorted emacs-like editors on palmtops for some time, and am greatly interested in handheld and portable computing. I have run emacs in some form on the HP200lx, HP 95 LX, HP 48g, Jornada 320LX, jornada 680, jornada 720, jornada 728, nokia communicator 9290, zaurus 6000L, and zaurus sl-c750 handhelds. 

I am currently running emacs 22 in eeeXubuntu 7.10 rc3 on an Asus eee PC 701 (2GB RAM, 4GB SSD, 4GB SD card) AND emacs 22 on a Nokia N800 web tablet running os2008. my .emacs for the n800 is on the MaemoEmacs page.
