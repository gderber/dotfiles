Let [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyan_Cat Nyan] [http://nyan.cat Cat] show you your buffer position in mode line.
Parts of the code and overall inspiration come from SmlModeLine.

Now with the ability to scroll the buffer by clicking on the Nyan Cat's rainbow and the space in front of it.

== Customization ==

If you use a custom `mode-line-format', `M-x nyan-mode' may not work for you. Instead, you can put <code>(:eval (list (nyan-create)))</code> somewhere in your `mode-line-format'. Screenshot (with `nyan-wavy-trail' enabled):
