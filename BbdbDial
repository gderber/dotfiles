= BBDB 3.0 =

BBDB has a dial interface which allows you to call an external interface to make a call.
This is done by modifying bbdb-dial-function. This is an example which interfaces with
Skype to make a call on Mac OS X.

{{{
(setq bbdb-dial-function
      '(lambda (phone-number)
         (do-applescript
          (concat
           "tell application \"Skype\"\n"
           "send command \"CALL +" phone-number "\" script name \"Call from BBDB\"\n"
           "end tell"))))
}}}
