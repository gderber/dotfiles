Want to update the MP3 tags of a whole bunch of files?
`tag.el' is a first step in this direction.
Use `M-x tag-directory' to specify a directory to edit.
Emacs will then call /mp3info/ on every file in the directory
and present it to you in a buffer.
You can edit all entries and hit `C-c C-c' to save the tags
for a file, or use `M-x tag-update-all' to save tags for all files.

* Lisp:tag.el

Note that [[EMMS]] also contains a tag editor.

I find that it works best with non-ASCII characters when I use `M-x prefer-coding-system RET iso-latin-1 RET'.

: This is probably as the ID3v2 spec specifies either latin-1 or unicode as a coding system.  If a text string begins with a
: Unicode byte order mark, the string is to be decoded as unicode, otherwise, latin-1 is assumed.  /mp3info/ would probably therefore want to receive
: an unencoded text (i.e. raw bytes) if it contained unicode characters.  However, I'm not really sure.

I'm regularly confused by ID3v2 (at the front of the file, shown by XMMS and friends) and ID3 (at the end of the file, edited by most of the command line
tools out there).  Somehow I'm having difficulties changing or deleting that
ID3v2 tag...
