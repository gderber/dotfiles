Displays an overlay face on mark location(s). Customizable faces and number of
marks to display. Can display marks from the mark ring in the normal backward
direction, and in the forward direction.

Get it from melpa or https://gitlab.com/iankelling/visible-mark.

== Tips ==

Useful functions like unpoping the mark are listed in MarkCommands.

Tip: I like not highlighting the region with visible-mark and allowing marks to
override paren highlights. -- [[IanKelling]]

  (setq show-paren-priority 999)
  (set-face-background 'region nil)

[new]
Tip: I find setting a colored underline face less in-your-face than a colored
background for the visible marks - especially if you're displaying all marks on
the mark ring.

[new]
Tip: I wanted the opposite: so that paren highlights do not override region
marking (aka selecting). -- [[NovadeViator]]

  (setq show-paren-priority -1)
