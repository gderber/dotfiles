This page is for enhancements to Emacs for use with command `diff' and the related Emacs major mode, DiffMode.


[:DiffMode-]
== diff-mode-.el ==

Library <tt>[[diff-mode-.el]]</tt> (note the hyphen at the end), extends the functionality in standard library ##diff-mode.el## by highlighting the ##Diff*## buffer differently. Here is a screen shot:

[[image:DrewsEmacsDiffMode]]

<tt>[[diff-mode-.el]]</tt> is for Emacs 21 and later. For Emacs 20 and older, see library <tt>[[diff+20.el]]</tt> ([[#DiffPlusTwenty]]). The highlighting of vanilla Emacs 22 and later comes close to that provided by <tt>[[diff-mode-.el]]</tt>.

[:DiffPlusTwenty]
= diff+.el, diff+20.el =

Libraries <tt>[[diff+.el]]</tt> and <tt>[[diff+20.el]]</tt> extend the functionality in standard library ##diff.el##. The former is for Emacs 21 and later; the latter is for Emacs 20 or older. (Library ##diff.el## changed significantly from Emacs 20 to Emacs 21.)

* ##diff+.el## is a minor extension that simply selects the ##*Diff*## buffer and fits its frame when `diff' is finished.

* ##diff+20.el## is the equivalent for Emacs 20 of library <tt>[[diff-mode-.el]]</tt> (see [[#DiffMode-]]).



== Other diff Enhancements ==

* [[Diff2Ediff]] -- Spawn an `ediff' session from within diff mode.
