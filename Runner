This library allows for a set of shell commands to be linked with file or directory names. Used in [[DiredMode]], these commands can then be run using `dired-do-shell-command' (or pressing "!").

Features: 
* Provides a widget.el interface to add, edit, and sort shell commands.
* Gets rid of the "A command is running - kill it? Yes or No?" message.
* Hides the stdout buffer if `runner-run-in-background' is set to t. Can be disabled for specific commands if the command string contains `{run:out}'.
* Uses `runner-shell-function' instead of `shell-command' if command string contains `{run:shell}'.
