Hello there gentle emacs users (greetings also to the vim user in you, I'm a vim user
too). ... so what brought me here is my perpetually failing effort to build the CVS
version of emacs on my Intel mac. Previously, when I only had my powerpc Powerbook G4, the
build would fail with the same error message:

{{{
Loading loadup.el (source)...
Using load-path (/home/ritesh/pkg/emacs/lisp /home/ritesh/pkg/emacs/lisp/emacs-lisp \ 
           /home/ritesh/pkg/emacs/lisp/language /home/ritesh/pkg/emacs/lisp/international \
           /home/ritesh/pkg/emacs/lisp/textmodes)
Loading emacs-lisp/byte-run (compiled; note, source file is newer)...
Invalid coding system: emacs-mule
make[1]: *** [bootstrap-emacs] Error 255
make: *** [src] Error 2
}}}

Well, this is not exactly the place to be bug-reporting, but as I said, looking to resolve
the bug is how I stumbled on the wiki, ''etc.''

What the gentle reader might actually find useful is my emacs customization file, which
I've perfected over years. Here's a
[http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/IVfS8iL18pxWZJZgB2aLGw?feat=directlink screenshot on
the mac]. The default font is '''Optima''', '''Futura''' is another nice font, where by
nice I mean easy on the eyes and aesthetically pleasing.  None of these are available on
X11, unfortunately. However, if one has access to the mac opentype fonts, one can use
FontForge to convert them to truetype and use those on Linux, and that is exactly how I
did it. The tabs btw, I obtained through {{{elscreen}}}, a feature that I had been sorely
missing in Emacs.

Now for the customization file itself, which you can't wait to get your hands on: Here's
the [init.el init file] that performs some checks and then loads the [Customization.el
customization file]. Its the latter that contains settings for the various faces that you
see in the screenshot.
