I have used emacs since the early 80's.  Finally there is a good keyboard for emacs: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AOWVN  The reason I like it is that the shift keys are all perfectly symmetric left to right.  Look at the control, meta (alt), and two keys that could be mapped to super on the image of the keyboard.
