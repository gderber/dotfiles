I use Emacs because it came on my Mac and I haven't downloaded any other versions.
Actually I use http://sourceforge.net/projects/joe-editor/ because Emacs's WordStarMode isn't very good yet, and because I don't like Emacs's mix of stagnation and intense undirected growth.
But Emacs and EmacsLisp and ParEdit still make one of the most powerful LISP interactive development environments.

And that's it for now.  At least you know a little about me as the author of any code I might post.
