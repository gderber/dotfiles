A UniCode problem:

* こんにちは ← Hiragana work well
* 本 ← but kanji does not
* 家 ← an other kanji

To try, save this page using

    wget http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/raw/2004-06-22

If you open the file using ''emacs -q'', you'll note that the two kanji are not decoded correctly.  Evaluate ''M-x utf-translate-cjk-mode'' or add the following to your ~/.emacs:

    (utf-translate-cjk-mode 1)

Now it should work.

This requires CVS Emacs.

: こんにちは! Hmm... I didn't have any problem with those ''kanji'' doing exactly what you suggested. From the docstring for {utf-translate-cjk-mode}:

:: ...This option is on by default....
