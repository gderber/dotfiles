=== imgur.com hosted images ===
An ''ordinary URL'' is not defined explicitly, but it would appear to require an image-type suffix (eg. <code>.jpg .png .gif</code> etc.)


http://imgur.com is a decent, easy-to-use host that does not require an account (unlike Flickr), but their images are not inlined by default <code>http://imgur.com/K2UweJp</code>

Unless you grab the special URL <code>http://i.imgur.com/mEfHEIZ.png</code>

'''To top it all off, this matches something in BannedRegexps and can't be posted in the main page''' Surprisingly (worringly?), comments don't get the same ban-hammer.

It depends on the actual regular expression that triggered the banning. Assuming you triggered the regexp that bans ending a page with a URL, for example, the explanation is simple: as a comment, your "signature" is added and thus your URL can never be "at the end" of the page text? Then again, bugs are always a possibility. :)

That must have been it. I edited this page to add one of the URLs at the end, and couldn't preview it.

However, I do note that prior to my edits, UploadingImages ''also'' ended with a URL.
