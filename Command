A '''[::command]''' is an InteractiveFunction, that is, a function that can be
executed by users via `M-x' or bound to a KeySequence.

When you use `M-x', Emacs prompts you for a command in the [[minibuffer]].


'''Note:''' Besides executing a command, you can also interactively execute an arbitrary ''Emacs Lisp [[Sexp]]'', using `<code>M-:</code>' (see EvaluatingExpressions).
