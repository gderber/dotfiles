Control character handling is enabled by default.  To disable it use M-x customize-variable RET erc-modules.

When the control characters B, _, V, C, O, or G are in messages, part or all of the message is meant to be
highlighted - or someone wants your client to beep.

By default, messages are highlighted bold, underlined, and inverse.
If you don't want to highlight messages but would like to strip all control characters:

    (setq erc-interpret-controls-p 'remove)

Beeping is disabled.  If you'd like to enable it, set `erc-beep-p'.  Note that you cannot both remove control
characters and beep.

=== Colors ===

Color highlighting is not enabled.  You'll need to set `erc-interpret-mirc-color' for that.

If you'd like to change the colors, you can customize the faces
`fg:erc-color-face0' - `fg:erc-color-face15' and `bg:erc-color-face0' - `bg:erc-color-face15'
