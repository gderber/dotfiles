I use GNU Emacs.

[::steinab] on #emacs.

I live in Norway. I started using Emacs late 2001 while learning Java. I love learning and extending Emacs, every new little detail is a source of joy for me. I love tweaking faces, setting key bindings, and generally smoothing and optimizing Emacs' behavior.

== I also use: ==
* [[Gnus]], The One True Newsreader
* ERC, the EmacsIRCClient
* [[EMMS]]
