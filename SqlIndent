 sql-indent.el --- indentation of SQL statements

This is a very quick hack that allows me to indent SQL statements.  You can use it together with SqlMode.  This code still needs improvements in order to reach the level of sophistication Emacs users are used to in other indentation engines.

You can get it here:

* https://github.com/bsvingen/sql-indent

An older version lives here:

* Lisp:sql-indent.el

As the indentation of SQL statements depends not only on the previous line but also on the current line, empty lines cannot always be indented correctly.  Hitting TAB on a line containing only whitespace will remove all whitespace and make the line empty; hitting TAB on an empty line will indent the line to the same column as the previous line; hitting TAB again will indent or outdent the line one step.  Hitting TAB after certain keywords will insert a tab character as well as indent the line.

Usage note: Loading this file will make all SQL mode buffers created from then on use `sql-indent' for indentation.  A possible way to install sql-indent.el would be to add the following to your .emacs:

    (eval-after-load "sql"
      (load-library "sql-indent"))
