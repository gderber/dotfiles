There's apparently an updated version available at https://github.com/sheijk/hideshowvis with a file-size limit.

Maintainer of hideshowvis here. Please don't use the EmacsWiki/EmacsMirror version, it is outdated and has (minor) changes. I think I've deleted this page in the past but apparently it got re-uploaded (history only has one version which it calls revision 10)
