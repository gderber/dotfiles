Ecasound is a very flexible audio multichannel
recording and mixing tool by KaiVehmanen.

Visit the [http://www.eca.cx/ecasound/ Ecasound homepage] for more information.

I am currently trying to write Emacs modes for the different
Ecasound file formats, and for the ecasound Interactive Mode (ecasound -i)
derived from comint-mode.

You can find the current version of what I have here:

[http://delysid.org/emacs/ecasound-el.html ecasound.el] -- All ecasound related code finally collapsed into one file. 

Long term aim of this project is making Emacs understand
as much as possible of ecasound command syntax, to be able
to provide generic and helpful completion functions and
in the future, eventually base some wizards on the underlying
data.

Alot of the above goals were met this week since I've written
ECI support for ecasound.el.  You can now complete all native effects
and ladspa effects, and get help for their individual arguments simply
by hitting tab.  The wizard thing also works, you can do M-x ecasound-cop-add RET
to interactively add a chainoperator for instance.
As a bonus, you can now write ECI based applications in Emacs-lisp using
ecasound.el, see functions eci-example and ecasound-normalize for examples on what
this means.
