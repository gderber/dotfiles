Rather than try to commit to maintaining yet another speed bump on
the Information <nowiki>SuperhighwaM-backspace M-backspaceWWW</nowiki>,
I'll simply provide a pointer to the web site I already managed to let
become hopelessly out of date in some parts:

* http://www.iki.fi/era/

There's an Emacs section there somewhere, buried inside the Unix
stuff. (I'll move it to its own page one day, and then the comment
you are reading now will also be out of date.)

In the meantime, I put some elisp code of mine up at

* http://porkmail.org/elisp/

I'm involved in too many things, so I will likely appear to have lost
contact from time to time. Then suddenly perhaps I'll resurface and
change everything on this Wiki (again <nowiki>:-)</nowiki>

== Places I've Contributed ==

I made some changes to the SiteMap and was probably the Evil Reason
why AlexSchroeder started the SiteMapDiscussion page, where I was also
active then.

I've added some random links and comments in other places too, but
those are pretty minor.

I created CategoryRemoteEmacs although I'm afraid it might have been a bad move <nowiki>:-)</nowiki>
