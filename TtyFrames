In GnuEmacs prior to 23, you could not open frames on other ttys.  You
could, however, use the same Emacs from different Linux consoles by
using screen(1) to do this.

The preferred approach would be to use EmacsClient.

In 22 or if you do not wish to use features like EmacsAsDaemon.

* Login, start screen, and within screen, start Emacs.
* Login on another tty again, start screen -x.  This will show you the
same Emacs.

Note that "another tty" may also be remote. Just ssh to the account
where you have your screen session running and start screen -x.

You can also easily connect tty frames and X frames to a single
instance of Emacs easily in [[emacs23]] same time.  This is possible
with [[XEmacs]].  Or with older versions of GnuEmacs using the
MultiTTYSupport that has now been integrated into
[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ Emacs23].
