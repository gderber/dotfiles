'''ERT''' is an '''E'''macs Lisp library for '''r'''egression/unit '''t'''esting. It is now included in Emacs, but can still be retrieved from its [http://github.com/ohler/ert old repository].

For examples of how to write tests with ERT, take a look at the manual in [[Info]], ##C-h
i m ert RET##, or [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/ert.html read the manual online], or look at [http://repo.or.cz/w/emacs.git/blob/HEAD:/test/automated/ert-tests.el ERT's own tests].


Lisp:ert-expectations.el translates EmacsLispExpectations syntax into ERT. You can use simple EmacsLispExpectations code in ERT environment.  -- [[rubikitch]]


If you want to run a single ERT test programmatically, here is the syntax. See the full thread at [http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/24117/run-a-single-ert-test-programmatically StackOverFlow].

    (ert-test-passed-p (ert-run-test (ert-get-test 'my-deftest-name)))
    nil  ;; test my-deftest-name failed
    t    ;; test my-deftest-name passed
