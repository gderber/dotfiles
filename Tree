[https://github.com/skogs/.emacs.d/blob/master/tree.el tree.el] is a powerful navigation tool to find files and grep through directories as defined by a tree-spec.  The best way to describe is to compare with TextMates find-file command and extending it to grep through all the files defined by the treespec.  By default, treespec is the top-level directory chosen and one can instntly grep though the folder.  If use 'grep', 'xargs' on a regular basis, tree.el can make these tasks much simpler and pleasurable.  The way to define a treespec is very powerful and avoids the pitfalls of many other similar libraries.  Try and have fun.
