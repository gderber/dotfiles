[http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/tacl-mode.el tacl-mode.el] provides emacs
support for Tandem Advanced Command Language. A proprietary command
language used on Tandem/NSK/Guardian systems.  See TandemNskSupport
for other Tandem specific modes.

Put the .el file into a directory in your LoadPath and add the following
to your ~/.emacs file:

    (autoload 'tacl-mode "tacl-mode" "A major mode for editing TACL files." t nil)


When you are visiting a TACL macro file, use 'M-x tacl-mode' to activate
the mode.

For best performance you should byte compile .el files but it's not
required. A CompiledFile usually runs faster. There should be no warnings
when compiling this file.

See TandemNskSupport for a method of automatically recognizing the
language of Tandem files since they don't have an extension and coders
often can't stick a -*-tacl-*- comment in line 1.

=== Downloading ===

If you are unfamiliar with this site, you can get files from the
ElispArea.

Or go directly to [http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/tacl-mode.el
tacl-mode.el] from [http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/index.html here].

=== ElDoc Support ===

This mode has builtin support for ElDoc mode.  But there is no way to
automate the generation of the help strings themsleves like TalMode can.

By default tacl-mode looks for a file named
[http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/tacl-syntax.el tacl-syntax.el] which is
expected to contain help string definitions.  You can customize
tacl-eldoc-def-files to look for a different file or even a list of files.  
The one I've uploaded contains around 750 doc strings I hope you find useful.
Files on the tacl-eldoc-def-files list need only be somewhere on your 
LoadPath to be found.
