Requirements:

Usage:

Mark a region of fontified text, run this function and in a number of
seconds you have the whole colorful text on your clipboard, ready to
be pasted into a RTF-enabled application.

It seems that there is a bug: after htmlize-buffer, it didn't set-buffer to the result of htmlize-buffer. Following is my (lgfang) fix for it.

I also tried htmlize-region. But that would cause Microsoft VBScript compilation error. Why?
