The guidelines for writing ERC modules are these:

# Follow established coding conventions (indentation, parenthesis placement, copyright lines, author, GPL paragraphs, ending with a provide statement, first and last line comments)
# The URL line should point to a page on this wiki named like the module (or similar)
# Use define-erc-module to define the minor mode, as well as the enabling and disabling functions.
