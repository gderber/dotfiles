There seem to be eight(!) different ways of building GNU Emacs on Windows; this page aims to list all of them in a nice regular way.  Each of the eight methods has its own page.  The name of each page consists of three parts:
* The Emacs version -- <nowiki>"TwentyOneThree" or "CVS"</nowiki>
* The type of built Emacs -- "Cygwin" or "W32"
* The tools used for the build -- <nowiki>"Cygwin", "MinGW", or "Msvc"</nowiki>

* CygWin Emacs
** 21.3
*** built with CygWin: BuildingTwentyOneThreeCygwinCygwin
** recent CVS
*** built with CygWin: BuildingCvsCygwinCygwin
* Win32 Emacs
** 21.3
*** built with CygWin: BuildingTwentyOneThreeWThirtyTwoCygwin
*** built with MSVC: BuildingTwentyOneThreeWThirtyTwoMsvc (no longer supported)
*** built with MinGW: BuildingTwentyOneThreeWThirtyTwoMingw
** recent CVS
*** built with CygWin: BuildingCvsWThirtyTwoCygwin
*** built with MSVC: BuildingCvsWThirtyTwoMsvc
*** built with MinGW: BuildingCvsWThirtyTwoMingw

For completeness, I'll mention <nowiki>BuildingTwentyOneThreeCygwinMingw, BuildingTwentyOneThreeCygwinMsvc, BuildingCvsCygwinMingw, and BuildingCvsCygwinMsvc</nowiki>, none of which are applicable, since non-Cygwin toolchains cannot create Cygwin binaries.
