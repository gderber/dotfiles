This page is about different libraries and ways to ''switch buffers''. As always, you can click the title heading to list all pages related to buffer switching.

* SwitchingBuffers -- Start here for a discussion comparing the various packages.

The following are specific tricks and packages for buffer switching.

* ListBuffers -- List buffers (default behavior for `C-x C-b')
* BufferMenu -- "Dired for buffers"
* IbufferMode -- BufferMenu extension/alternative
* BufferMenuPlus -- BufferMenu extension/alternative
* ElectricBufferList -- BufferMenu alternative
* BufferSelection -- BufferMenu alternative
* IswitchBuffers -- choose buffer without a menu (name-based)
* InteractivelyDoThings -- the ido package changes buffer switching
  and file finding
* [[Icicles]] -- switch among buffers -- both ''cycling'' and ''[[Completion]]'' are available. Perform actions on selected buffers or sets of buffers.
* LustyExplorer -- Dynamic filesystem explorer and buffer switcher
* DoReMi -- use arrow keys and/or mouse wheel with `doremi-buffers' (`C-x t b') to ''cycle'' among buffers 
* SwBuff -- another way to cycle among buffers
* [[BufferRing]] -- simpler MTorus like rings
* PointStack -- go back to places in buffers that you've marked
* RecreateScratchBuffer -- when ##*scratch*## disappears
* [[Anything]] -- can be used to switch to a buffer, too.
* [[ControlTABbufferCycling]] -- emulates application switching on Windows for buffers in Emacs
* CategorizingInformationManager -- provides ee-buffers for buffer switching
* CycleBuffer -- switch to next/previous significant buffer with a single keystroke
* BufferQuickSwitcher -- Another way to switch buffers
* TabBarMode -- buffer tabs in Emacs 21
* EasyBufferSwitch -- A combination of number indexed switch and cycle switch
* [[Lisp:contentswitch.el]] -- switch buffers by their content
* [[Lisp:jump-or-exec.el]] -- Jump to a buffer matched by buffer-name, or call function when not found. This is enlighted by [[http://sawfish.wikia.com/wiki/Jump-or-exec jump-or-exec from sawfish]].
* [[cOpenRelational]] -- keeping in touch between header file and source file for C or C++
* FindHeaderFile -- open C/C++ header file on current line
* [[MTorus]] -- provides navigation on a discrete 2-torus of buffers
* [[iflipb]] -- interactively flip between recently visited buffers
* [[PinBar]] -- create tabs at the top and switch associated buffers with a single stroke
* SwitchFiles -- Intelligently switch to a different file, keeping a path as you go.
* [[Rebound]] --   Enable each window to remember and return to its value of point in each buffer it has displayed.
