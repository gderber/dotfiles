Occur search the full list of keybinds & their commands. Very helpful for learning and remembering forgotten binds.

 (defun search-keybind (regexp &optional nlines)
   (interactive (occur-read-primary-args))
   (save-excursion
     (describe-bindings)
     (set-buffer "*Help*")
     (occur regexp nlines)
     (delete-windows-on "*Help*")))

I use C-M-u, change this to something more appropriate to emacs defaults as you see fit.

 (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-u") 'search-keybind)
