Shell Script mode, `sh-mode', is the major mode for editing Unix and GNU/Linux shell script code.  It was originally authored by DanielPfeiffer

It supports several shell variants, including ##bash##, ##csh##, ##ksh## and ##zsh##, as well as plain Bourne shell, ##sh##.

* GIT:progmodes/sh-script.el

See ShellMode, for using the shell interactively.

See DosMode, for editing Dos scripts (batch files).

== Icicles Enhancements to Shell Script Mode ==

In Shell Script mode, command `complete-tag' is remapped to `comint-dynamic-complete', so the latter is bound to the keys that would normally be bound to the former. This is the vanilla Emacs behavior.

Icicle mode remaps `comint-dynamic-complete' (hence the same keys) in Shell Script mode to a similar command that uses [[Icicles]] [[completion]] whenever there are multiple completion candidates. This means that you can [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycle]] to choose a candidate, complete using one or more substrings or [[regexp]]s ([[progressive completion]]), and so on. See [[Icicles - Completion in Other Buffers#ShellCommandCompletion|Icicles - Completion in Comint Modes]].

* ShAutoconf -- An autoconf flavour for ##sh-mode## as an alternative to AutoconfMode

== Q&A ==
Q: There should be a manner to send commands to an inferior ShellMode buffer.

A: Try

  (process-send-string (current-buffer) "echo Merry X-mas!\n")

Q: Generally, how does one customize sh-mode?
Specifically, when I type ##if [ ... ]## and hit return, it indents.
I want to disable this behavior, and only auto-indent to the indentation of the previous line (which in this case is zero).
I'm using GNU Emacs 24.4.1.

Q: Problem with bash - quoted command substitution

GNU Emacs 24.5.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0, NS apple-appkit-1265.21)
{{{
# this is OK
LINK=$(echo $PROFILE | awk -F\; '{print $2}' | sed 's/\ /\-/g' | sed 's/"//g' | sed 's/^/cdi-profile-/g')

# quoting the above throws off the mode
# in particular, causes lines following this one to be treated as strings
LINK="$(echo $PROFILE | awk -F\; '{print $2}' | sed 's/\ /\-/g' | sed 's/"//g' | sed 's/^/cdi-profile-/g')"
}}}
