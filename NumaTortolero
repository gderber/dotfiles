I'm a simple emacs user. I like to program in functional languages, specially Lisp, its dialect, Scheme, and sometimes in Haskell.

I use these languages to play with algorithmic music.

Too I frequently use emacs to edit TeX files.

I'm not a professional programmer. I studied music composition and philosophy. I work as philosophy teacher in Unearte (Experimental University for the Arts, Caracas, Venezuela), Universidad Central de Venezuela and Universidad Simón Bolívar (Caracas, Venezuela).
