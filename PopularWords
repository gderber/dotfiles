[[ja:ポピュラーな単語]]
This mode warns you if you use any word that is not one of the 1000 or 2000 most popular words. There are two separate modes based on `text-mode' that do nothing except mark the most popular words using the `default' face. Everything else is highlighted in the `error' face.

The list of words is from the 2000 most frequent words from the [WikiPedia:Brown_Corpus Brown Corpus]. You can find them all over the Internet.
