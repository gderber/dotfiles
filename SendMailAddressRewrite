If your smtp server is a non-address-rewriting MTA (like the qmail default), 
and if you'd like your domain name to be added automatically to the addresses,
here's a way to do it.
----
You'll have to change sendmail-send-it (or smtpmail-send-it if you're using
smtpmail).  

	  (mail-sendmail-undelimit-header)
	  (setq delimline (point-marker))
	  ;;  (sendmail-synch-aliases)
	  (if mail-aliases
	      (expand-mail-aliases (point-min) delimline))
	  (smtpmail-addr-rewrite (point-min) delimline)

That last line is the new line added.  Here's the definition for that file.
stolen mostly from the alias rewriting code

 (defun smtpmail-addr-rewrite (beg end)
   "Rewrite addresses in suitable header fields found between BEG and END.
 If interactive, expand in header fields.
 Suitable header fields are `To', `From', `CC' and `BCC', `Reply-to', and
 their `Resent-' variants.
 "
  (interactive
   (save-excursion
     (list (goto-char (point-min))
	   (mail-header-end))))
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char beg)
    (setq end (set-marker (make-marker) end))
    (let ((case-fold-search nil))
      (while (let ((case-fold-search t))
	       (re-search-forward mail-address-field-regexp end t))
	(skip-chars-forward " \t")
	(let ((beg1 (point))
	      end1 pos epos seplen
	      )
	  (re-search-forward "^[^ \t]" end 'move)
	  (beginning-of-line)
	  (skip-chars-backward " \t\n")
	  (setq end1 (point-marker))
	  (goto-char beg1)
	  (while (< (point) end1)
	    (setq pos (point))
	    ;; EPOS gets position of end of next name;
	    ;; SEPLEN gets length of whitespace&separator that follows it.
	    (if (re-search-forward "[ \t]*[\n,][ \t]*" end1 t)
		(setq epos (match-beginning 0)
		      seplen (- (point) epos))
	      (setq epos (marker-position end1) seplen 0))
	    (let ((string (buffer-substring-no-properties pos epos))
		  translation)
	      (if (and 
		   (not (string-match "@" string)) ; No @ in the name
		   (not (equal string "")))
		  (progn
		    (setq translation (concat string "@" smtpmail-sendto-domain))
		    ;; Replace the address with it's translation
		    (goto-char pos)
		    ; (message (concat "Address rewrite is changing " string " to " translation))
		    ; (message (concat "Processing address " string " at " (number-to-string pos) " " (number-to-string epos) " " (number-to-string (point))))
		    (insert translation)
		    ; (message (concat "Changed into " translation " at " (number-to-string pos) " " (number-to-string epos) " " (number-to-string (point))))
		    (delete-region (point) (+ (point) (- epos pos)))
		    (forward-char seplen)
		    )
		(goto-char epos)
		(forward-char seplen))))
	  (set-marker end1 nil)))
      (set-marker end nil)))
 )
