RELAX NG (REgular LAnguage for XML Next Generation) is a schema language for XML. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELAX_NG Wikipedia article].

= Editing modes =

RELAX NG has both an XML syntax and a compact non-XML syntax.

You can find Emacs related stuff on http://relaxng.org/ page.

== RNC Emacs Mode ==

[http://www.pantor.com/download.html original home page], currently defunct.

Available on the MELPA package archive, and on [https://github.com/TreeRex/rnc-mode GitHub].

A small Emacs mode for editing RELAX NG schemas in the compact syntax. XML syntax not supported. Written by David Rosenborg. Open source (BSD license).

= Converting schemata to RNC format =

{{{
  $ man trang
  trang [-I rng|rnc|dtd|xml] [-O rng|rnc|dtd|xsd] $input $output
}}}

Conversion from XSD schemata to RNC a bit more complicated:

{{{
  $ java -jar $libdir/rngconv.jar from.xsd >tmp.rng
  $ trang tmp.rng to.rnc
}}}
