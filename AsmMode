AsmMode is a simple assembly programming mode that comes with Emacs. It is based on TextMode.  See AssemblyProgramming for alternatives.

AsmMode has some strange (relative to other Emacs modes) defaults for indentation (as of Emacs 24.5): It sets `tab-always-indent' to `nil' so that hitting `TAB' will each time insert a tab stop, pushing the code farther to the right. Therefore I suggest using the following config which resets `tab-always-indent' back to the default:

{{{
(defun my-asm-mode-hook ()
  ;; you can use `comment-dwim' (M-;) for this kind of behaviour anyway
  (local-unset-key (vector asm-comment-char))
  ;; asm-mode sets it locally to nil, to "stay closer to the old TAB behaviour".
  (setq tab-always-indent (default-value 'tab-always-indent)))

(add-hook 'asm-mode-hook #'my-asm-mode-hook)
}}}
