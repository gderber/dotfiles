This is an [[rcirc]] extension. It replaces all the nicks with random names pulled from a list.
It adds nick completion as well, so other channel members should not be able tell you are doing it.

Code:

* Lisp:rcirc-random-names.el

Maybe this will provide the illusion of a 50:50 gender presence online.
It's probably also confusing as hell.

To alleviate the confusion, there's the realname command:

* ##/realname NAME## will show you the appropriate nick to random name mapping.

* ##/realname## by itself will show you all the nick to random name mappings.
