= Volatile Highlights Mode =
VolatileHighlights highlights changes to the buffer caused by commands such as 'undo', 'yank'/'yank-pop', etc. The highlight disappears at the next command. The highlighting gives useful visual feedback for what your operation actually changed in the buffer.

It is available at Lisp:volatile-highlights.el and https://github.com/k-talo/volatile-highlights.el

;; Overview
;; ========
;; This library provides minor mode `volatile-highlight-mode', which

;;
;;    (require 'volatile-highlights)
