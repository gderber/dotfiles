Lisp:strptime.el partially implements POSIX date and time parsing.

Here's the docstring:

 `strptime' (buffer: StrPTime, mode: Odd)


 Interactive Lisp function:

  arguments: (time format)


  Return a nine element list of TIME, parsed according to FORMAT.

  The elements of the list are of the same form as those returned by
  `decode-time' and may be used as aguments to `encode-time'.

  (SEC MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH YEAR DOW DST ZONE)

  The returned date may be outside the range `encode-time' can handle.

  This is a partial implementation of the POSIX `strptime' function.

  Following directives are supported:

  %d
      The day of the month [01,31]; leading zeros are permitted but not
      required.
  %D
      The date as %m / %d / %y.
  %e
      Equivalent to %d.
  %H
      The hour (24-hour clock) [00,23]; leading zeros are permitted but
      not required.
  %I
      The hour (12-hour clock) [01,12]; leading zeros are permitted but
      not required.
  %m
      The month number [01,12]; leading zeros are permitted but not
      required.
  %M
      The minute [00,59]; leading zeros are permitted but not required.
  %n
      Any white space.
  %p
      The locale's equivalent of a.m or p.m.
  %R
      The time as %H : %M.
  %S
      The seconds [00,60]; leading zeros are permitted but not required.
  %t
      Any white space.
  %T
      The time as %H : %M : %S.
  %y
      The year within century. When a century is not otherwise
      specified, values in the range [69,99] shall refer to years 1969
      to 1999 inclusive, and values in the range [00,68] shall refer to
      years 2000 to 2068 inclusive; leading zeros shall be permitted but
      shall not be required.

      Note:
          It is expected that in a future version of IEEE Std
          1003.1-2001 the default century inferred from a 2-digit year
          will change. (This would apply to all commands accepting a
          2-digit year as input.)

  %Y
      The year, including the century (for example, 1988).
  %%
      Replaced by %.
