A new major version of Emacs was released last week.

What are some new and cool features available in the this new version?

* Improved UnicodeEncoding support (the internal character representation is
now based on UTF-8).

* Font rendering with Fontconfig and Xft, see XftGnuEmacs.

* Support for using X displays and text terminals in one session,
  and for running as a daemon.  See MultiTTYSupport and EmacsAsDaemon.

* Per-buffer text scaling.

* ShiftSelectMode, TransientMarkMode and PartialCompletionMode are on by default.

* Emacs now supports the XEmbed specification.  You can embed Emacs in another application on X11.  See EmacsXembed.

* Emacs now supports the SVG image format through librsvg2.  See EmacsSvg.

* New !NeXTSTEP-based port provides support for GNUstep (via the GNUstep libraries) and Mac OS X (via the Cocoa libraries).  Currently, the Nextstep port is not as stable as the other existing ports; but will be improved in future releases.  See EmacsApp.
