I don't know how you go about changing hyperlinks in emacswiki so could you please do it for me?

@DavinPearson: Please ''learn how to add and update links'' yourself. 

Follow the HowTo link at the top of any page. Then click the ''Edit the wiki'' link. Then click the TextFormattingRules link. Then click ''Links and Anchors'' in the table of contents. Bookmark any pages that you find helpful.
