Hi, I'm Katsuyuki Kiso and I belong to the Japanese electric manufacturer. I always use Emacs when I write the programs and execute shell commands. I hardly use it on the job, but I have used it in my room for about 4 years. 

I'm interested in spacemacs, eshell, org-mode and emacs-lisp. Basically I will improve Emacs if I write the programs efficiently. Now I want to get the information especially about eshell, which I recently started to use instead of zsh.
