Hi, my name is Aleix Conchillo. Remember that in some countries, like Spain, we use both, father and mother surnames. So, I could not be called Aleix Flaque. Even though, I am sure I'd turn around :).

Some years ago, I knew that some "weird" editor with almost no buttons and with an old fashion look&feel existed. I even had open it sometimes. But in 2001, I was introduced to Emacs, The One True Editor, by JoseAntonioOrtegaRuiz, and a complete new world was opened to my eyes. I still don't have much experience, almost zero, in EmacsLisp, but I hope to fix this someday.

I'd like to thank you all for making Emacs what is it. And of course, to RichardStallman for creating such a masterpiece.
