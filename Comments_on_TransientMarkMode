The highlighting is a nuisance ALWAYS.  I do NOT need the editor to tell me where my mark and point are; I put them there, I know where they are.  Can anyone tell me how to disable the  highlighting PERMANENTLY?  TIA

No need to rant and rave. To disable it, put the following in your [[init file]]: ##(transient-mark-mode -1)##
