This page is about library Lisp:el-swank-fuzzy.el, which is based on ##swank-fuzzy.lisp## distributed by SLIME (see [http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Fuzzy-Completion.html Fuzzy Completion - SLIME user Manual]).

Thanks to the CL implementation authors for that useful software.

##el-swank-fuzzy.el##
provides a single function, `el-swank-fuzzy-completions',
which you can use to get swank completions similar to those provided by SLIME/swank's fuzzy completions.

How do you use this as a replacement for lisp-complete-symbol in elisp code? There are no interactive functions defined in el-swank-fuzzy.el -- [[catphive]]

[new:]
Some possibilities:
* Use [[Icicles - Fuzzy Completion#SwankCompletion|Icicles swank completion]].  With the current `TAB' completion method as `swank' you automatically get swank fuzzy completion, including for `M-TAB' to complete Lisp symbols.

* Use HippieExpand for Lisp symbol completion, and supply it with the list of completions provided by `el-swank-fuzzy-completions'.

* Use [[Anything]] with `anything-el-swank-fuzzy-complete-symbol' -- AnythingApplications.

What are the minimum requirements for `el-swank-fuzzy-completions' to return completions? In a Emacs Lisp buffer, I'm trying to expand to `multiple-value-bind' (example provided by the documentation of 'el-swank-fuzzy-completions' itself) by evaluating this code (the arrow show the expression value):

 (el-swank-fuzzy-completions "mvb") -> (nil nil)
 (el-swank-fuzzy-completions "m-v-b") -> (nil nil)

This works:

 (el-swank-fuzzy-completions "mu-v-b") -> ((("multiple-value-bind" "18.71" (... ... ...) "-")) nil)

whilst this doesn't:

  (el-swank-fuzzy-completions "m-va-b") -> (nil nil)

Thanks.
