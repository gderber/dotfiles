That's not the whole story. According to Pascal (a 17th century Roman
Catholic) you do have to guide your life in a different way to gain
immortality after death. This basically means that you have to put an
ascetic element into you style of life. So it is not true that "you're
no worse off than an atheist". All he says is that -- my own words --
this is a very good investment, though, because the potential
interests are so incredibly high.

But this point of view has two problems:

# you have no way to second-guess "god's" motivations. How do you know
  that she is really pleased with "believers" that came to her because
  of gambling? How do you know that worshipping matters at all?
  Perhaps the only way to gain eternal happiness is to wear a green
  hat on each monday? Or does it depend on the text editor you choose?
# You have no way to tell, *which* deity you should worship and which
  religion you should follow. Maybe there are several deities and they
  all insists that you worship their divine community as a whole? Or
  if there is only one deity: Should I be a Christian, a Jew, a Moslem
  .... If Christian, Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Protestantic? Or more
  to the point: should I worship Emacs or XEmacs? Does it even matter?

Questions about questions. All in all I'd say it is a safe bet to use
Emacs. You gain happiness on earth for sure and if there is really a
heaven.el after M-x death, then you even gain eternal life.

Comment: This point of view has another flaw: If you are religious, then 
not only are you an enemy for the other religions, but they are enemies 
to you instead (you have to fight the others). If you are an atheist, you 
can just ignore their fantasies and concentrate on the really important 
parts of life :)
