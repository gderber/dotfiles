All the search issues on EmacsWikiProblems make me think that perhaps we'd be better off using DuckDuckGo?
Apparently, [http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/03/changes_to_the.html Bruce Schneier uses it].
If you feel like trying it, I've added a second search box to the site that you can activate:

* http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=browse;id=2013-05-07;duckduckgo=1 -- enable it
* http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=browse;id=2013-05-07;duckduckgo=0 -- disable it

I've also added a menu item to the _Administration_ section (link at the bottom of every page).
Report back if you notice any problems.

FWIW, for some time now I've generally given up on the wiki's own search and have just typed my search terms plus "emacswiki" into my Google toolbar.

The one thing I miss, and which used to work well, is being able to click a page heading to get the wiki pages that link to that page.  That's been pretty much broken for a while now.

Drew, what browser are you using? The click-page-heading-for-backlinks works for me in Cghrome 26.0.whatever, IE10, Firefox Aurora 22.0a2 (2013-05-03) and Firefox regular, whatever that is. in Win7

I like what DuckDuckGo stands for, though.

IE 7.  But I doubt that the browser is relevant here.

It works for me too.  But it doesn't work. ;-)

That is, I get results, but not all, and not even the most important, most obvious ones.  I don't have examples off the top of my head, sorry.  But I can say that (1) it used to work very well and (2) it has not worked well for a while now (at least a year, I'd guess). -- DrewAdams

I guess that means unless anybody else speaks up, I'll switch to DuckDuckGo in the near future and we'll give it a try. -- AlexSchroeder
