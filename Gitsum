== Overview ==

`M-x git-status' from official Git distribution's contrib directory is
usually good enough to use, but it does not support partial commits,
that is, commit only parts of a file. After running `M-x gitsum' from
git controlled buffer, a new buffer will created, containing all
changes, made in current repository. You can kill everything you don't
want to commit with `k', navigate between hunks with `n' and `p' and
between files with `N' and `P'. A whole file can be killed with `K'.
To refine the patch, split it with `C-c C-s'. If you toggle read-only
with `C-x C-q', you can edit everything freely; be careful about it.
