I'm probably going to move the site to a different server before the end of the year. This means that there will be a day on an upcoming weekend where the wiki will switch to read-only mode. I'll change the DNS entry and a copy of the site will be waiting for your at the new host. As soon as your local DNS updates, you will be sent to the new site and everything will be editable again.
