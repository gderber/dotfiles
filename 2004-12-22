This is the summary of a thread started on 2004-12-09,
called /Permission to use portions of the recent GNU Emacs Manual/.

Richard --

The GNU Emacs user's manual has changed its license to the GFDL.  The XEmacs
manual has a different license -- the GPL.  Because of contributions from
various parties, we cannot easily change our license, and apparently there
are incompatibilities between the GFDL and the GPL.

Therefore I am wondering if you will give us permission to incorporate parts
of the GNU Emacs manual under the existing XEmacs license [...]

Too bad.  I won't relicense such a large amount of material all
together.
    
If you show me specific parts you would like to use, I will consider
relicensing them.

Richard, please reconsider.  You have a reputation of antipathy towards
XEmacs.  If you're at all interested in mending fences a little, this would
be a very easy step -- simply declare that we are allowed to use the code
under our license (which was your license up through 2000 or so).  Otherwise
you give the impression of actively hindering the XEmacs project.

RichardStallman [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2004-12/msg00715.html]:

<pre>
I did not choose this license with a view to its effects on you; it is
the general FSF policy for manuals.  However, the fact that it is
inconvenient for XEmacs does not strike me as a disadvantage.  After
all, you have been uncooperative towards us for 10 years, and you
don't see that as a disadvantage.  We don't owe you anything, not even
small favors.

Despite my well-known and justified antipathy towards XEmacs, I
offered to consider changing licenses on parts.  However, the response
was an ungreatful threat, so I now withdraw that offer.  If I did even
the slightest thing for XEmacs now, I might give the impression of
being a pushover.


I ask all Emacs developers not to respond any further to whatever
they may say here about this.
