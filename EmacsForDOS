EliZaretskii maintains the port of GNU Emacs for
MSDOS and MS Windows (notice that there is a separate EmacsForWindows).
You can download precompiled
versions with the latest DJGPP archives.
Choose a [http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/getting.html mirror] 
and see -> current -> v2gnu -> emacs.README.

The emacs.README file contains crucial info about what's in the other 10 zip
files and how to install them and get started with Emacs on MSDOS/MS-Windows platforms.

More from Eli: 

: It might be of interest to Windows users that this version of Emacs supports long filenames (only on Windows 9x and Windows 2000 - not Windows NT) and the Windows clipboard (all versions of MS-Windows). It also supports multiple frames, but they all overlap, like when Emacs runs on a "glass teletype" terminal. 

: People who would like to run Emacs on plain DOS (as opposed to Windows) will need to download and install a DPMI host.
