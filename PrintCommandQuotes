Solving a print problem using Windows Script Host (WSH) with Win32 Emacs:
Getting Emacs to produce quotes on the command line.
</b>

To specify a printer on the [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/gsprint.htm GSPRINT.EXE] command line, the -printer switch is required.  This switch requires that the printer name be surrounded by quotes on the command line.  A sample command (issued directly from a Windows command prompt) might be: 

    /path/gsprint.exe -printer "Canon" myfile.ps.

The problem with doing this from within Emacs is that Emacs does not seem able to pass quotes to the command line.

One solution is to substitute hash marks (#) for quotes, and use a WSH script to translate hash marks to quotes.  Set up Emacs to "print" to the WSH script, then make the WSH script issue the actual print command.

Here are the details:

In Emacs:

    (setq ps-printer-name-option "-printer ")
    (setq ps-printer-name "#Canon#")
    (setq ps-lpr-command "cscript.exe") ; Windows Script Host
    (setq ps-lpr-switches 
       '("c:\\documents and settings\\me\\my documents\\gs-call.vbs"))


gs-call.vbs (sitting in "my documents"):

    Dim wsh
    Set wsh = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
    Dim oArgs
    Set oArgs = Wscript.Arguments

    RunPrnt

    Public Sub RunPrnt()
      Dim CLine, arg, rv
      For Each arg in oArgs
        ' the following translates hash marks to double quotes
        arg = Join(Split(arg,"#"),"""")
        CLine = CLine & " " & arg
      Next

      CLine="""c:\Program Files\Ghostgum\gsview\gsprint.exe""" & CLine
    '  MsgBox CLine & vbCRLF
      rv=wsh.Run (CLine, 1, True)
    '  MsgBox "rv=" & CStr(rv)
    End Sub

The commented out !MsgBox calls are useful for debugging.
