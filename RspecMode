== Overview ==

Rspec mode is a minor mode that provides some enhancements to
ruby-mode in the contexts of RSpec specifications.  Namely, it
provides the following capabilities:

== Features ==

* toggle back and forth between a spec and its target (bound to
   `\C-c ,t`)

* verify the spec file associated with the current buffer (bound to
   `\C-c ,v`)
  
* verify the spec defined in the current buffer if it is a spec file
  (bound to `\C-c ,v`)

* verify the example defined at the point of the current buffer
   (bound to `\C-c ,s`)

* re-run the last verification process (bound to `\C-c ,r`)

* toggle the pendingness of the example at the point (bound to `\C-c
    ,d`) 

* disable the example at the point by making it pending

* reenable the disabled example at the point

* run all specifications for project (bound to `\C-c ,a`)
