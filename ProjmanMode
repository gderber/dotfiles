Simple global minor mode for working with a collection of source code files in a directory tree, a "project".
Lisp:projman.el

== Overview ==
projman makes it easy to switch between multiple projects and automatically setup your emacs environment correctly for each.

A project is identified by a root directory and a series of project keywords, variables and hook functions that are applied when the project is opened.  Each project can also maintain a list of open buffers, closing them when quiting a project and automatically restoring them when opening a project (similar to desktop-mode).  There are also a series of commands that can be applied to the files of a project.

== Setup ==
Use ##projman-projects## to define your projects and options. (see doc string for details)
<pre>
 (setq projman-projects
       '(("myproject"
          :root "c:/_proj/myproject"
          :ignore-dirs ("tests")
          :type c
          :open-hook (lambda () (global-auto-revert-mode 1))
          :compile-command "devenv.com c:/_proj/myproject/myproject.sln /build Debug"
           )))
</pre>

Load the projman.el library and execute projman-mode to start.

== Usage ==
##projman-switch-project## is used to switch between projects.  This will setup the project environment and optionally restore buffers from the previous session.

Once a project is active there are also a series of commands that can be used (see projman.el for more)
* ##projman-dired-root##  : open a dired buffer on the project root
* ##projman-grep##  : run rgrep in root of project
* ##projman-occur##  : run multi-occur against all open project buffers
* ##projman-svn-status##  : psvn status in the project root
* ##projman-create-tags##  : create a tags file for project

A project can also be created on the fly using ##projman-create-project## but it currently only allows a small number of options to be specified interactively.

If ##projman-use-active-file## is non-nil (the default) projman will record the open buffers when a project is closed.  These will then be automatically visited when the project is later opened.  If ##projman-lazy-load-buffers## is non-nil this will be done is a lazy fashion.  See also ##projman-close-buffers-when-close-project## to automatically close the buffers when existing a project.

== Note == 
Because projman makes use of the find command it will only work on a unix type environment, but windows+cygwin works fine provided that cygwin's find command is used instead of the windows find command.

See ##projman-find-command## for a way to specify the command path if needed.
