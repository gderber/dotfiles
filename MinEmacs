MinEmacs is an initially minimal yet infinitely extensible variant of the One True Editor

The first release will be a simple script that removes non-critical packages from the core distribution and adds InstallCommandOnAttempt bootstrap code - so all the original COMMANDS and all those available from various package repos *appear* to be available from Meta-x and/or keyboard shortcuts, but are actually seamlessly downloaded when attempted.


==Candidates for removal from core==

''Please write your worries or explanations after each file or fileset, and add others with explanations''

* etc/DOC-X -- Emacs will not start without this 2MB file.
* etc/DOC -- This file is identical to etc/DOC-X!
* etc/tutorials/TUTORIAL -- Emacs will not start without this file.
* lisp/calc
* lisp/cedet
* lisp/emulation
* lisp/erc
* lisp/gnus
* lisp/ldefs-boot.el -- Is this a copy of loaddefs.el?
* lisp/mail
* lisp/mh-e
* lisp/obsolete
* lisp/org
* lisp/play
* lisp/language
* lisp/(many more non-critical files to consider)

* etc/ -- Probably not everything can go, but there is quite a bit of silliness here
* info/ -- This would require we first write `InstallInfoOnAttempt'
* lisp/ChangeLog* -- hmm...


==Future==
Later releases may patch the source-code and recompile a smaller executable with a plugin interface which will allow us to augment the editor in a far more vigorous manner - allowing the possiblity of Video Editing, 3D-Modeling, Gaming, etc. while remaining within this great environment.
