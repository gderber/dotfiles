MouseAvoidance moves your MousePointer out of your way

  M-x mouse-avoidance-mode

  (mouse-avoidance-mode 'none)  ;; turn it off
  (mouse-avoidance-mode 'jump)  ;; jump away randomly when approached
  (mouse-avoidance-mode 'banish) ;; jump to corner when typing
  (mouse-avoidance-mode 'exile)  ;; jump to corner when approached
  (mouse-avoidance-mode 'animate) ;; fru-fru
  (mouse-avoidance-mode 'cat-and-mouse) ;; same
  (mouse-avoidance-mode 'proteus)  ;; same + change the pointer shape

The above methods are not useful for preventing the mouse
from highlighting random buttons when you scroll with pgdn
or the mouse wheel.  banish moves the pointer to the tab bar
in w3m which makes mouse wheel not work.  What would work is
to move it to the minibuffer.

Another way of adjusting the mouse pointer is by editing PointerShape
