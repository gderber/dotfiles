GNU Emacs 22 pretest may start soon---assuming someone can be found to check two remaining files in the EmacsLispReference for factual mistakes (lispref/text.texi and lispref/modes.texi).  This has been the main bottleneck in the Emacs 22 release process.

 Subject: Pretest can be soon

 If people would please do the requisite checking of a couple
 more files in the Lisp manual, and if a few of you that I asked
 to look at certain bugs would do it, we can start pretest.
