I am an electrical engineering student at The Cooper Union in New York City. My main OS is Arch Linux.

I started using emacs ([[GnuEmacs]]) 2 years ago and am just now getting around to learning Elisp and Common Lisp.

In addition to emacs being my editor of choice for programming and [[LaTeX]], it is also my primary audio player ([[EMMS]]), irc client ([[ERC]]), and IM client ([[BitlBee]])).
