Hi, 


== About me ==
my name is IÃ±igo Serna, been a happy GNU Emacs user since many-many years ago.

I use emacs to do all file editing, programming, and some agenda handling.

== elisp code I've written ==
* [[https://bitbucket.org/inigoserna/per-buffer-theme.el|per-buffer-theme]]: Change theme according to active buffer name or major mode. Can be found in MELPA.
* [[https://bitbucket.org/inigoserna/pmdm.el|pmdm]]: pmdm, poor man's desktop-mode, is a simple alternative to desktop-mode for writing and opening loaded files.
* [[DevelNotes]]: add annotations to sources and track them in an org file.


== my init-file ==
Maybe someday I'll clean and could show it...
