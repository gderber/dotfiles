When I use the save-desktop-mode, the current buffer when I open emacs (the first buffer that is active when I open emacs) is always in read-only mode, and I should to write "M-S-: (setq read-only-mode nil)" in order to shut down it. How can I avoid that?

The article ends up with this line:
    See SessionManagement for other similar packages.

I would suggest to put it at the beginning of the article.
