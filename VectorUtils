==Overview==

Vector-manipulation utility functions.

==Quickstart==

    (require 'vector-utils)
 
    (vector-utils-flatten '[1 2 [3 4 [5 6 7]]])
    ;; '[1 2 3 4 5 6 7]
 
    (vector-utils-depth '[1 2 [3 4 [5 6 7]]])
    ;; 3

==vector-utils==

Vector-utils is a collection of functions for vector manipulation.
This library has no user-level interface; it is only useful for
programming in Emacs Lisp.

Furthermore (when programming in Emacs Lisp), be aware that the
modification of a vector is not permitted: only vector elements may
be changed.  All "modification" operations herein can only work by
making copies, which is not efficient.

The following functions are provided:

    `vector-utils-depth'
    `vector-utils-flatten'
    `vector-utils-insert-before'
    `vector-utils-insert-after'
    `vector-utils-insert-before-pos'
    `vector-utils-insert-after-pos'

To use vector-utils, place the vector-utils.el library somewhere
Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'vector-utils)
