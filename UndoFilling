The simplest thing is to set the fill-column to 9999 or something like that, and then use M-q to fill the paragraph, and M-n to move to the next paragraph.

C-u 9999 C-x f M-q M-n M-q M-n M-q M-n M-q M-n . . .

Or, using keyboard macros:

C-u 9999 C-x f C-x ( M-n M-q C-x ) C-u 99 C-x e

: . . . where 99 is the number of times to do a M-n M-q (it's ok if it does it too many times)

Or, in an elisp function:

 (defun unfill-buffer ()
   "Undo filling for all paragraphs."
   (interactive)
   (goto-char (point-min))
   (let ((fill-column 99999))
     (fill-paragraph nil)
     (while (< (point) (point-max))
       (forward-paragraph)
       (fill-paragraph nil))))
