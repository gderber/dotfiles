Hi, my name is RodrigoLazo and I'm a proud user of emacs since
2004. I have a blog [http://www.rlazo.org] and it's part of
[[PlanetEmacsen]]. I use [[OrgMode]] for everything I can, from
keeping notes to blogging (my blog's engine is Wordpress, and you
posts directly from orgmode, here is how
[http://www.rlazo.org/2010/10/28/org-mode-wordpress-org2blog-awesomeness/]). My
IRC nick is rlazo.

I build my emacs binary directly from bzr, and it's /very/
stable, but not *always*, and if you have a tendency to update
your editor when you have a deadline coming, is a good idea to
keep a stable release binary just in case.
