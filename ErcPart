Configure what happens when leaving a channel or IRC server.

Part a channel with `C-c C-p'.  Or optionally type ##/part## into a
channel (the alias ##/leave## also works.

Quit a server with `C-c C-q'.  Or optionally type ##/quit## into a
channel or server buffer.

By default, the interactive version prompts for a reason.  The IRC
commands can be provided a reason as arguments or left blank.

If left blank, the default is to say the version of ERC.

To set the default reason to an `M-x yow' quote, use:

    (setq erc-part-reason 'erc-part-reason-zippy)
    (setq erc-quit-reason 'erc-quit-reason-zippy)

To set up various reasons with aliases, set:

    (setq erc-part-reason 'erc-part-reason-various)
    (setq erc-quit-reason 'erc-quit-reason-various)

Then configure them with

    (setq erc-part-reason-various-alist
        '(("yow" erc-part-reason-zippy)
          ("xmms" dme:now-playing)
          ("version" erc-part-reason-normal)
          ("home" "Gone home !")
          ("^$" "Default Reason")))

By default, a channel's buffer remains after you've left it.

To kill when leaving a channel:

    ;; Kill buffers for channels after /part
    (setq erc-kill-buffer-on-part t)



 (setq erc-part-reason (quote erc-part-reason-various))
 (setq erc-part-reason-various-alist (quote (("^np$" emms-show) ("zippy" erc-part-reason-zippy))))
