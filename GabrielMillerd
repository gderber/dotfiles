I am Gabriel Millerd <gmillerd/at/qualhost/dot/com> ... I really get a lot of use out of emacs.

Currently i use:

emacs-nox on OSX and Linux

* PerlMode (cperl-Mode)
* AbbrevMode (wish this would obey indenting somehow) (i added this AbbrevModeOpenOffice)
* FlySpell
* AutoFillMode
* FoldingMode
* nxml-mode

* auto-captialize.el
* bm.el
* maybe-open-apostrophe()
* wget.el
* tail.el

someday i will get this working better, its sort of unstable for me
* mmm-mode (html/tt2/css/js)

wish this would work better. its a disaster in cperl-mode looks like 'the matrix' sometime.
* setnu (line numbering) 

cannot seem to get this to work for <tab>, everything says it should be however when i display my bindings. The document TabKey didnt help.

i use this function quite a bit (nxml/cperl)
