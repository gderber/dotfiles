CoffeeMode allows Emacs users to submit a BREW request to an RFC2324-compliant coffee device (Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol, or HTCPCP).

It prompts the user for the different additives, then issues a HTCPCP BREW request to the coffee device.

You can probably guess how CoffeeMode came about ...yadda yadda everything but make coffee ...yadda yadda ...

CoffeeMode requires a special BREW-capable version of Emacs/[[w3]] to be installed. 1999-09-29, under GNU GPL.

Available as part of the Debian package emacs-goodies-el.
