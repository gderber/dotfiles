I like Emacs, and I use it on Linux, Windows. 

I also had a chance to use it on i5/OS and it was awesome :) To do this I ran it in PASE mode through SSH with Emacs binaries for AIX :)

I use Emacs as a file manager (dired is great), shell, and as an IDE for Java, C++ in cases when usage of Eclipse is not possible :)

My works are:

* WThirtyTwoHardDrivesMenu -- provides menu with all currently available local drives (useful in dired)
* WThirtyTwoFilePropertiesDialog -- opens Windows "File Properties" dialog box for specified file or directory
* Made some changes in LsLispToggleVerbosity
