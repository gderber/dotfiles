The definition of '''[::sexp]''' from the EmacsManual:

: The word `sexp' is derived from "s-expression", the ancient
  term for an expression in Lisp.  But in Emacs, the notion of
  `sexp' is not limited to Lisp.  It refers to an expression in
  whatever language your program is written in.  Each programming
  language has its own major mode, which customizes the syntax 
  tables so that expressions in that language count as sexps.

Here are a few EmacsLisp sexp examples:

 (foo bar 42)

 '(foo bar)

 foobar

 42

 "foobar"
