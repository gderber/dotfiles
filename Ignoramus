==Overview==

Ignore backups, build files, et al.

==Quickstart==

    (require 'ignoramus)

    (ignoramus-setup)    ; sets `vc-directory-exclusion-list',
                         ; `dired-omit-files', `ido-ignore-directories',
                         ; `completion-ignored-extensions', etc.

    C-x C-j              ; backups and build files now omitted from dired

==Explanation==

Every library has its own method for defining uninteresting files
to ignore.  Ignoramus puts the listing of ignorable-file patterns
and the logic for applying those patterns together in one place.

To use ignoramus, place the ignoramus.el library somewhere
Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'ignoramus)
    (ignoramus-setup)

By default, `ignoramus-setup' will apply every action that it
knows about for ignoring files.  Currently these are

    comint
    completions
    dired
    eshell
    grep
    ido
    nav
    pcomplete
    projectile
    shell
    speedbar
    vc

You can specify a shorter list of actions as an argument

    (ignoramus-setup '(pcomplete shell ido))

or customize the value of `ignoramus-default-actions'.


==Availability==

==Bugs==

The one-size-fits-all approach necessarily makes this library
a blunt instrument.
