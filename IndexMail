You can make a index of your stored mails using dedicated tools and a Gnus backend. This allows you to easily search through your entire mail database.

== Setting up swish-e ==

The setup is quite easy. First choose your SearchEngine. I especially recommend DebianUser to install swish-e (http://swish-e.org) which is quite quick to index even with a huge amount of files.

Then you have to tell your index tool to ... index your stuff.

I personnally did it using this command:

 swish-e -i . -f /home/zedek/Mail/index.swish -e -v 2

It means I asked to swish-e to index all files and directories (recursively) under the current directory (in fact I was in the Mail tree ~/Mail). The -f parameter indicates to create an index file named index.swish under ~/Mail. -e switch means "economic mode" (less use of RAM) and -v 2 is for the level of verbosity.

For more informations on the use of the tools please consult the README files and/or go to the swish-e website.

Depending on the amount of mails you get, it may take a while :)

Now let's say your stuff has been succesfully indexed, all you need to do is to configure gnus to access the data.

Such a task will be achieved by using the nnir backend by KaiGrossjohann.

Actually, nnir is able to access data from several index tools (have a look into source code) such as wais, namazu, swish-e, swish++.

Just add into your .gnus file the following command :

 (require 'nnir)
 (setq nnir-search-engine 'swish-e)
 (setq nnir-swish-e-index-files (list (expand-file-name "~/Mail/index.swish")));

There are other parameters you also can set but this is enough to start.

Now whenever you will type 'G-G', Gnus will react by asking you to type keywords you want him to retrieve mails for.

Then nnir will open a new buffer with the possible mails matching your request.

You can there choose to go to the thread by typing 'G-T' (Mx gnus-summary-nnir-goto-thread RET) onto an item. You will then be teleported into the group this article came from. Note that gnus-summary-nnir-goto-thread is replaced by gnus-summary-refer-thread in newer Gnus. 

== Downloading ==

You should find the latest nnir.el file available at :

http://quimby.gnus.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/gnus/contrib/

but something is wrong with the web interface right now (2005-11-15).

XEmacs gnus package contains nnir.el, but works for
(setq nnir-search-engine 'swish-e)
only from XEmacs gnus package version 1.87 up (= gnus-version 5.10.7).

As of 2005-11-16 this is a pre-release available from
http://www.xemacs.org/Releases/index.html#Pre-Releases

== Tips ==

Debian users can find nnir.el by installing emacs-goodies package.

: In squeeze nnir.el is in the gnus-bonus-el package. However the version there is from 2003 and does not seem to support IMAP.

The index will need to be updated regularly.

Since Oort Gnus nnir.el is part of Gnus. You can find it in the contrib directory.

=== Incremental Indexing ===

For nnml backends: rather than full indexing each time use incremental indexing:

  swish-e -i . -N /home/zedek/Mail/index.swish -f /home/zedek/Mail/index.incremental -e -v 2

This will only index files added since index.swish was created. Note this will work only for nnml backends, since new mails are stored as new files.

Then merge the two indexes with

 swish-e -M index.swish index.incremental index.tmp
 mv index.tmp index.swish

This can lead to missed files if new files got added <u>while</u> index.swish was getting created (if it took a while to run). Look into documentation of swish-e on ways to avoid that.

For an automatized ad-hoc incremental indexing solution using shell scripts, see IncrementalIndexMail.

== Problems ==

I have encountered big problems using swish++ search tools when trying to index my mails. It was working for hours without results so I am harmly recommending you not to use this tool if your are a DebianUser.

The indexing process can be very long.

IIRC, it took about 30 minutes (for me) to index 1500 Mo of mails.

: Current versions of swish-e are much much faster than the version in Debian woody. -- Dirk

: This speed is pretty good for search engines. If swish++ don't support incremental indexing, you can try Lucene instead. -- LiuJin

[new]

I just tried swish-e -i . -f /$HOME/Mail/index.swish -e -v 2, as suggested above, and am seeing lots of complaints like

        input conversion failed due to input error, bytes 0x8C 0x88 0x92 0xE8

I don't know if these are serious problems or not.

[ A swish-e bug ]

There seems to be exist  a long-standing (googleable) bug in swish-e program

     $ swish-e -f ./index.swish-e -w Count
     => 1000 err: Failed to seek to properties located at 7816 for file number -1743650816 : Invalid argument

I am not sure if it relates to an issue with mbox-format folder indexing, but that was
the index target indeed.
After hitting this bug I switched to Mairix (which passed my tests outstandingly!).

== Indexing Mail with gnus-namazu.el ==

If you don't want to use swish-e and nnir.el I recommend you to try namazu [1] and gnus-namazu.el, which is in gnus/contrib like nnir.el. These are the settings I have in my .gnus.

 (require 'gnus-namazu)
 (gnus-namazu-insinuate)
 (setq gnus-namazu-make-index-command "mknmz")
 (setq gnus-namazu-make-index-arguments
      '("--all" "--mailnews" "--deny=^.*[^0-9].*$" "--exclude=(SPAM|ham)"))

These are all standard settings except gnus-namazu-make-index-arguments where I added "--exclude=(SPAM|ham)" for not indexing my SPAM an ham folder which hold only useless mails for training my spam filter.

Now you can create the index of your mails with `M-x gnus-namazu-create-index' and then search for a mail with `C-c C-n'.

[1] If namazu isn't part of your dirstibution you can get it from http://www.namazu.org

== Indexing mail using Mairix ==

Mairix is a tool for searching words in locally stored mail.
Along swish-e and unlike others it supports indexing of mail folders (the mbox format mails).
It is very fast and easy to set up. For more information on how to use Mairix with Gnus visit GnusMairix.

== Indexing mail using mailindex ==

A Lucene-based mail indexer written in Clojure.  Requires a separate long-running JVM process to index and search mail, but indexes NNML and IMAP mail in near-real-time with a relevance-ranked search: [https://github.com/marktriggs/mailindex https://github.com/marktriggs/mailindex]
