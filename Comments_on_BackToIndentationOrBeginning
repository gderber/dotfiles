In end-of-code-or-line, point-in-comment gives an error and does not seem to be defined anywhere, is it a custom function that just was not included in the code here ?

Hm, this is strange.  I'm almost sure, when I looked at this page, it
has a working code.  ISTR this 'point-in-comment' was defined using
'syntax-ppss'.  Anyway, did you try "mwim" package?  I use it all the
time :-)
