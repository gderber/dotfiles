Yes, he is said to use Emacs.  You can even find a library or two on
his home page:

Notably there is this emacs lisp package: 
* http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs/color-mode.el

It lets the user highlight lines with different colors, which are 
persistant across file-saves and re-loads (a line in color "a" 
is saved with a leading Control-A, the saved file begins with the 
line "Color-Mode", which kicks you back into color-mode when it's 
re-loaded).

= Emacs quotes =

: "Some parts of me like mathematics, and some parts of me like
  emacs hacking."

: "I use the Emacs editor very heavily"

: "So now I don't read electronic mail, but I do use it occasionally. Say
  I'm taking a trip to Israel and I've got to make last minute
  arrangements. When I visit another university or research center for a
  few days, I have to send email from there. I've learned how to use the
  email facilities in Emacs, but I don't want to get good at it."
