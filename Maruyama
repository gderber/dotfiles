I'm a japanese user who want to add japanese pages to this site.

----
= Tips for Japanization =
* See MultilingualWiki.
* How does www.emacswiki.org work?
** Perl package `Oddmuse' [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/oddmuse.pl?Translations] are used.
** With `Oddmuse',Cgi-code [http://www.emacswiki.org/scripts/wiki wiki] is working.
** For japanese [http://www.emacswiki.org/scripts/emacs-jp emacs-jp] is working now, because Alex had it all set up.
** The difference from [http://www.emacswiki.org/scripts/wiki wiki] is...
*** [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/config-jp config-jp] is used as `ConfigFile' which determins the strings such as サイトマップ or Holidays with including [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/config config].
*** added the code: "do '[http://www.emacswiki.org/scripts/japanese-utf8.pl japanese-utf8.pl]'"; japanese-utf8.pl is defining the strings in detail like a error message. But, now (2003-10-23) these strings are not Japanized and this is included in the project `Oddmuse'. (CVS commiting is needed.) 
Then, we should send e-mail to Alex@...
* Names such as Category for Multilingualization
** For Chinese (nization), 分類－說明 and someting like this are prepared.
And I think the sentence is cool:
English:EmacsNewbie | Français:NouvelUtilisateurEmacs in [[Emacs初學者]].
** For Spanish, CategoríaAyuda.
** For Japanese, what is good? 分類 is also Japanese. 
But there is a good solution with using KATAKANA. カテゴリ or カテゴリー.

= Log for Japanization =
== 2003-10-21 ==
In oder to do, I follow MultilingualWiki.

# Translate the name of the links on the goto bar at the top (SiteMap,
  RecentChanges, ElispArea, HowTo, [[News]])

: [[サイトマップ]], [[更新履歴]], [[Ｅｌｉｓｐセクション]], [[利用手引]],[[ニュース]]

: I will put these on the server tonight. -- Alex.

:: Thanks! -- Maruyama.

* I think "Howto" is Howto in Japanese.
But, try to translate.

: Perhaps just write it in double-width Romanji?  Or Katakana...  I don't know.  :)

:: 利用手引 means Manual. ハウツー for Katakana of HowTo was used and is not used by youngstars. ＨｏｗＴｏ is a good solution, but I think this is also
used by other Asian languages, maybe.

# Translate the default text for new pages ("Describe the new page here.")

: Cut and paste making. But there is some questions ...

* How to make ResentChanges automatically?

: This will work automatically once I have it all set up. -- Alex.

:: Now it works.

* How to manage the comments on ElispArea?

: Just write whatever you think your Japanese readers will require.  There is no need to really "translate" everything, specially not every comment and question.  -- Alex.

== 2003-10-22 ==
# Translate the default text for new pages ("Describe the new page here.")

: Over "Cut and Paste", I added few japanese. I ended it.

# Translate the strings in the user inteface on the Oddmuse page [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/oddmuse.pl?Translations]

'''Q''': I want to know the difference between wiki.pl and emacs-jp.pl.
Now emacs-jp.pl is completely same as wiki.pl?
How can i get the infomation about current emacs-jp.pl?

'''A''': If you want to look at the Perl code, take a look at
http://www.emacswiki.org/scripts/ -- there you will find all the
files in the cgi-bin directory of this server.  Some of these
are linked to the same file without .pl extension.  In you case you
want to compare
[http://www.emacswiki.org/scripts/wiki wiki] with
[http://www.emacswiki.org/scripts/emacs-jp emacs-jp].
You will see that emacs-jp uses the
[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/config-jp config-jp] file
in addition to the
[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/config config] file.
(When viewing the files, you might have to switch the character
encoding to UTF-8 manually in your browser.)
You will also see that 
[http://www.emacswiki.org/scripts/japanese-utf8.pl japanese-utf8.pl]
is currently an empty file.  (I have uploaded an empty translation file
to CVS.)

: Thanks. I understood. -- Maruyama


: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/oddmuse.pl?action=edit;id=Japanese

: And i think default emacs-jp.pl, i mean emacs-jp.pl without translations, 
is enough for japanese users.

# Send your translations to the host: mailto:alex@emacswiki.org
