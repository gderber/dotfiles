15:55 <forcer> We already have namespaces! You just prefix
      stuff with namespace-, namespace--, or namespace/!
16:02 <kensanata> forcer: I agree with you regarding
      namespaces. Namespaces are a convention and I think
      elisp shows that that's often good enough.
16:03 <forcer> kensanata: I was being sarcastic. :-(
16:03 <kensanata> forcer: Nooooooo!

This is what the manual says:

: "You should choose a short word to
distinguish your program from other Lisp programs. The
names of all global variables, constants, and functions
in your program should begin with that chosen prefix.
Separate the prefix from the rest of the name with a
hyphen, `-'.
: "This practice helps avoid name conflicts,
since all global variables in Emacs Lisp share the same
name space, and all functions share another name
space.
: "Use two hyphens to separate prefix and name
if the symbol is not meant to be used by other
packages."
: -- [[Manual:Coding Conventions]]

EmacsLisp doesn't offer namespaces. Multiple ideas and implementations abound, however.

* [https://github.com/chrisbarrett/elisp-namespaces elisp-namespaces] using a `namespace' macro at the beginning of your file

* [http://draketo.de/licht/freie-software/emacs/namespaces-elisp Namespaces in Emacs Lisp] using a `namespace' macro where all your symbols are defined in the macro's body

* [https://github.com/Malabarba/names The Names package] similar to the previous, provides a `define-namespace' macro. It's a more complete solution, tackling things like `eval-defun'. It  “is designed as a practical, complete, robust, and debuggable tool which writes your namespaces for you.”  See [https://github.com/Malabarba/names/blob/master/UsageExample.org this usage example] that shows namespaces are added to your library.

* [https://github.com/Malabarba/Nameless The Nameless package] lets you pretend to have namespaces by hiding the namespace prefixes with font locking.

* [http://nic.ferrier.me.uk/blog/2013_06/adding-namespaces-to-elisp Hatching a plan to add namespaces to EmacsLisp] is a blog post talking about namespaces with some pointers to discussions on [[emacs-devel]].

* [https://github.com/kbauer/myelisp-namespace-helper.el myelisp-namespace-helper.el] is a quick solution for more easily inserting namespace prefixes with the `-' key, and support for visually collapsing the prefix with `prettify-symbols-mode'. This approach avoids the risk of breaking interactive features.
