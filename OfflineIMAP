OfflineIMAP is a popular IMAP mail synchroniser. A popular combination is [[Gnus]]/[[Wanderlust]] for mail reading, OfflineIMAP for sync and [[Dovecot]] as the local email server.

==Encrypted auth info==
As with [[GnusEncryptedAuthInfo]], it's possible to keep your email password encrypted. Take a look at /usr/share/offlineimap/offlineimap.conf for all remotepass/remotepasseval options. 

One method would be to use a standard desktop keyring, see http://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring

Another would be to import some python gnupg bindings and parse your ~/.netrc.gpg or ~/.authinfo.gpg. 

===Using EasyPG===
If you run emacs as a server and already use epg + netrc to for your other passwords (e.g. <code>(setq smtpmail-auth-credentials (expand-file-name "~/.netrc.gpg"))</code>), one nice alternative is to run offlineimap through [http://julien.danjou.info/software/offlineimap.el offlineimap.el] and get the password from emacsclient. 

In ~/.offlineimaprc, put <code>remotepasseval = get_password_emacs("imap.host.com", "993")</code>

In ~/.offlineimap.py, put 

    import subprocess
    def get_output(cmd):
      # Bunch of boilerplate to catch the output of a command:
      pipe = subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
      (output, errout) = pipe.communicate()
      assert pipe.returncode == 0 and not errout
      return output
    def get_password_emacs(host, port):
      cmd = "emacsclient --eval '(offlineimap-get-password \"%s\" \"%s\")'" % (host,port)
      return get_output(cmd).strip().lstrip('"').rstrip('"')

and in ~/.emacs put 

    (defun offlineimap-get-password (host port)
      (let* ((netrc (netrc-parse (expand-file-name "~/.netrc.gpg")))
             (hostentry (netrc-machine netrc host port port)))
        (when hostentry (netrc-get hostentry "password"))))

Then just M-x offlineimap; if you haven't opened your key this session yet, it'll prompt for the password, otherwise it'll use the agent (if you've set it to do that).
