We missed our *ten year anniversary*!! I trusted the info on the EmacsWiki page which said something about the wiki starting up in 2003 ("AlexSchroeder started experimenting on thinkmo.de February 2003 and the wiki went online March 2003"), but PierreGaston made me check the [Self:action=rc;all=1;from=1;showedit=1;rcidonly=SiteMap complete change log for SiteMap] and I realized that the first edit was made in **2001-05-14**. The [http://web.archive.org/web/20010610005205/http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl Internet Archive Wayback Machine agrees] and has a snapshot for **2001-06-09**.

Does anybody feel like creating a *commemorative T-shirt* and adding it to EmacsMerchandise?

Congratulations!!!! I will definitely buy a T-shirt!

'''''Congratulations!'''''  And thanks to everyone, but especially to Alex!  %%EmacsWiki%% has been around for 10 of the 35 years of Emacs's existence! And as there are no doubt more Emacs users now than in decades past, the wiki has no doubt helped more than its 10/35 years alone might indicate. -- DrewAdams
