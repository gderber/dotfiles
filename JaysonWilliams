Hi

I've been using Emacs since my switch to linux in 2007 and have recently (2011) decided to attempt a bit of elisp coding.  My first elisp project will be EpubMode for emacs.  It will allow emacs to open epub format e-books.  I was pretty surprised that something like this didn't already exist.  So after several months of contemplating, I decided to give it a shot.

There is a Sourceforge page for EpubMode at https://sourceforge.net/p/epubmode/wiki/Home/ as well.

Welcome to the Wiki! If you hang out on #emacs, you should add yourself to EmacsChannelPeople.
