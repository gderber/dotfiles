==What's LazySearch ?==
LazySearch is new search mode that is based on OneKey.
It can take various strings around point and search fast.

==What makes LazySearch useful?==
* Mark various strings around point:
: You can mark various strings around point, just type *a single* keystroke. 

* Switch search type:
: Switch various search types with *a single* keystroke.

* Lazy search:
: Type *a single* keystroke to search next or previous match.
: Yep, that's me, I can't be bothered to type more than a single keystroke for that.

* View in search:
: You can move cursor or scroll buffer when searching.
: You can use this feature to view the buffer or match different search types quickly.

* Copy search object:
: You can just type *a single* keystroke to copy the search object.

* Transfer your search to Isearch:
: You can translate between LazySearch and [[Isearch]].

* Other advanced features
** Edit search object.
** Search from yank.
** Search previous search object.
** Query-replace search.
** Integrate with Lisp:color-moccur.el.
** And any feature you like add......

==Install==
* This packages needs Lisp:one-key.el.  Make sure you install it first.
: Download Lisp:one-key.el and Lisp:lazy-search.el

* Put Lisp:one-key.el and Lisp:lazy-search.el in your load-path, and then add
{{{
     (require 'lazy-search)
}}}
: in ~/.emacs .

* Or you can use Lisp:auto-install.el install LazySearch with the following:
## M-x auto-install-batch RET
## Input "lazy-search"

:: (How to install Lisp:auto-install.el, see AutoInstall)
                                    
* Bind any keystroke you like to `lazy-search-menu'.  I do:
:: (global-set-key (kbd "M-s") 'lazy-search-menu)

==Usage==
By default, LazySearch will popup a help window when you execute the command `lazy-search-menu'.

* Features included in Lisp:lazy-search.el:

** Mark:
:: w -- Mark word.
:: b -- Mark symbol.
:: u -- Mark URL.
:: f -- Mark file name.
:: m -- Mark email.
:: x -- Mark sexp.
:: l -- Mark current line.
:: [ -- Mark parentheses.

** Copy: 
:: S -- Copy search Object.
:: W -- Copy word.
:: B -- Copy symbol.
:: U -- Copy url.
:: F -- Copy file name.
:: M -- Copy email.
:: X -- Copy sexp.
:: L -- Copy line.
:: { -- Copy parentheses.

** Move:
:: s -- Move forward.
:: r -- Move backward.
:: HOME -- Move first.
:: END -- Move last.
:: H -- Move start.
:: L -- Move end.

** View:
:: down arrow -- View next line.
:: up arrow -- View previous line.
:: left arrow -- View backward char.
:: right arrow -- View forward char.
:: Ctrl-down arrow -- View scroll down one line.
:: Ctrl-up arrow -- View scroll up one line.
:: Page Up -- View scroll down one page.
:: Page Down -- View scroll up one page.

** Search:
:: c -- Search object cache.
:: Y -- Search yank.

** Isearch:
:: Ctrl-s -- Switch to isearch.

** Others:
:: t -- Toggle keep region after quiting 
:: E -- Edit search object.
:: . -- Return mark initiation position.

* Features including in Lisp:lazy-search-extension.el:

:: v -- Moccur.
:: V -- Moccur all.

: You can customize all these keystrokes by modifying lazy-search-menu-alist.

==Tips==
: You can bind the command `isearch-to-lazy-search' with `isearch-mode-map'.  I do it like this:
:: (define-key 'isearch-mode-map (kbd "M-l") 'isearch-to-lazy-search).

: Then type "M-l" when you are searching in isearch. Isearch will transfer its search object to [[LazySearch]] mode.
