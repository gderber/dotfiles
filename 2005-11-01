The category !CategoryPackages was deleted today from the SiteMap and in articles mentioning it.  No one is expected to miss its passing.

It used to fit the purpose of organizing Emacs Lisp code that was neither an Emacs mode (CategoryModes) nor just a customization (CategoryDotEmacs).  With the ontology of the EmacsWiki developing and diversifying over the years, many of these articles previously under !CategoryPackages are now associated with a more useful category.

See SiteMapDiscussion for related discussion.
