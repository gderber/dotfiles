This is a nice addition to emacs. I had difficulty getting it to work initially because emacs could not find mogrify.  This was because of the setting of the variable eimp-mogrify-program.  eimp.el describes the variable as:

"Name of mogrify program. Should be in PATH."

I used <code>(setq eimp-mogrify-program "/usr/local/bin/mogrify")</code> in my .emacs file to get it to work.

I've started using eimp to view images in emacs, but often don't want to save the changes it makes when I fit the image to the window.  I also often want to look at the image quickly, kill it, and then delete the associated window.  The following can be added to eimp.el to get this functionality:

{{{
(defun eimp-kill ()
  (interactive)
  (set-buffer-modified-p nil)
  (kill-this-buffer)
  (delete-window))
}}}
