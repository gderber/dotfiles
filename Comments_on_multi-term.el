After pulling in latest from melpa, edit history is broken. I am not longer able to edit history properly as it is meddling with previous command.

I just maintain multi-term.el on EmacsWiki, i'm sure melpa is older than EmacsWiki one.

I have the same problem. It seems to be caused by ("C-m" . term-send-input) in term-bind-key-alist - if you get rid of that, everything works fine (i.e. C-m and RET are bound to term-send-raw again).

Melpa pulls in updates automatically, I think, so it should always match the version on the wiki

Hi, I've just switched to FreeBSD from Linux and noted an odd behaviour.  

On Linux, I changed directory inside the terminal, the Emacs current directory changed for that buffer.  So I could do, say "cd ~/foo" in the terminal, then "M-x find-file-in-project" and find-file-in-project would treat "~/foo" as its current directory.

In FreeBSD this doesn't happen; if I "cd ~/foo" the current directory doesn't change, so a subsequent "M-x find-file-in-project" treats the current directory as being wherever Emacs was started in.

Is there anything I can do to ensure that multi-term.el behaves the same way on FreeBSD?

The manual says: "Unlike Shell mode, Term mode does not track the current directory by
examining your input.  But some shells can tell Term what the current
directory is.  This is done automatically by `bash' version 1.15 and
later."
I therefore assume that you're not using the same shell?
