== A more intuitive interactive entry ==

This behaves a little more like the emacs help functions that you
might be accustomed to:

 (defun my-dictionary-search ()
   (interactive)
   (let ((word (current-word))
         (enable-recursive-minibuffers t)
         (val))
     (setq val (read-from-minibuffer
                (concat "Word"
                        (when word
                          (concat " (" word ")"))
                        ": ")))
     (dictionary-new-search
      (cons (cond
              ((and (equal val "") word)
               word)
              ((> (length val) 0)
               val)
              (t
               (error "No word to lookup")))
            dictionary-default-dictionary))))

The Texinfo source files and Info generated output, both for English and Spanish, are in http://gnu.manticore.es
I added an Index (concepts, functions, variables, keys and programs) to the documentation.

AFAIK, there is a dictionary.el is present with XEmacs distribution.M-x dictionary RET --GirishB

I have briefly tried dictionary-el and lookup-el, the former worked out of the box here.:)   -- DeepakGoel

Ding comes with a quite usuable German <-> English dictionary. apt-get install it or get it from

* http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~fri/ding/

You can access the dictionary from emacs (change the path if needed) with

    (defun my-ding (&optional query)
      (interactive (list (read-string "Query: " (current-word))))
      (let ((coding-system-for-read 'latin-1)
          (coding-system-for-write 'latin-1))
        (grep (concat "egrep -nHih " query " /usr/share/trans/de-en"))))

dictionary.el works beautifully with utf-8 but, I can't seem to get it to work for my mandarin
dictionary (encoded in big5).  Seems that dictd is configured properly as I can search chinese 
characters using the dict client (even in eshell).  I have set 

    (setq dictionary-coding-systems-for-dictionaries
           '( ("test" . chinese-big5))

where "test" is the name of my dictionary.  I can sort of see what the problem is, in that,
if I execute (dictionary-encode-charset "han-zi "test"), where. "han-zi" is actually a 
chinese character that seached just fine using dict in eshell, the result is gobbledy gook.
Any ideas as to how to debug this would be greatly appreciated.  I've got dictionary-1.8.7,
on GNU Emacs 21.4.1 (stock Debian install). -- BrianTodd

Emacs 24 drops support for make-local-hook. The Debian package linked above includes a patch to get round this. Those unfamiliar with patching can also [https://github.com/myrkr/dictionary-el grab the updated dictionary.el from git]. -- antono
