The smiley module is disabled by default.  To enable it use M-x customize-variable RET erc-modules.

ERC Smiley mode is a tiny mode that uses `smiley-region', which is
defined in smiley.el, which is part of Oort Gnus.

To change the smileys, take customize the variable
`smiley-regexp-alist'.  Here is an example for your ~/.emacs, if you
do not want to use custom:

    (require 'smiley)
    (add-to-list 'smiley-regexp-alist '("\\(:-?]\\)\\W" 1 "forced"))
    (add-to-list 'smiley-regexp-alist '("\\s-\\(:-?/\\)\\W" 1 "wry"))
    (add-to-list 'smiley-regexp-alist '("\\(:-?(\\)\\W" 1 "sad"))
    (add-to-list 'smiley-regexp-alist '("\\((-?:\\)\\W" 1 "reverse-smile"))
    (add-to-list 'smiley-regexp-alist '("\\(:-?D\\)\\W" 1 "grin"))
    (add-to-list 'smiley-regexp-alist '("\\(:-?P\\)\\W" 1 "poke"))

If you change the variable after having used the smileys, you need to
empty the cache and update it again.  Usually this is not needed,
however.

    ;; (setq smiley-cached-regexp-alist nil)
    ;; (smiley-update-cache)

And if you want other smileys, use `smiley-data-directory' to point
the smiley code at something else.
