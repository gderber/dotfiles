Here is a very curious way in which you can set up signatures generated with Emacs Lisp every time.  I use both <tt>C-x m</tt> (<code>mail</code>) and <code>gnus-summary-reply</code> et al.

My signature is my name and nicks, then the output of "fortune", then output from the Emacs <code>spook</code> function.

In addition, <code>mail</code> seems to obey my customized setting of <code>user-mail-address</code>, but Gnus seems to ignore it.  I also want all messages I write saved to a file, which <code>mail</code> fixes up automatically, but Gnus doesn't.  So I fix this by adding a From line to my mail headers every time I open a new Gnus outgoing message.

    (defconst fortune-program "fortune"
      "Name of executable local `fortune' program.")

    (setq mail-signature
          '(progn
             (insert "\n\n--\nStephen Compall or s11 or sirian\n\n")
             (call-process fortune-program nil t)
             (spook))

According to the GNU EmacsManual, setting <code>mail-signature</code> to an expression means that <code>mail</code> will evaluate it at the end of the buffer every time you start a message.  That takes care of <code>mail</code>.  But Gnus doesn't obey <code>mail-signature</code>, <strong>and</strong> I've got the From address problem to take care of, so I add this hook:

    (defun s11-from-fcc-sig ()
      "Add From, FCC, and signature to current buffer."
      (save-excursion
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (forward-line)                  ;sets at beginning
        (insert "From: " user-full-name " <" user-mail-address ">
    FCC: " mail-archive-file-name "
    ")
        (goto-char (point-max))
        (eval mail-signature)))

    (add-hook 'gnus-message-setup-hook 's11-from-fcc-sig)

Wasn't that fun?  Of course, if you only want the spook output, you can just add <code>spook</code> as a hook to both <code>mail-setup-hook</code> and <code>gnus-message-setup-hook</code>.
