upcase-word, downcase-word, and capitalize-word come in handy, but they don't go far enough.  Some suggestions:

* pluralize-word: Converts the word after point to its plural.  Does The Right Thing for both nouns and verbs.  See PluralizeEnglish.
* singularize-word: the opposite.
* dualize-word: An inflected form used in some languages
* {past,present,future}-tense-verb: The obvious.  No effect on non-verbs.
* [[Synonyms]] provides a list of synonyms for a word.
* change-gender command

My goodness, that's quite ambitious.  Wouldn't this require grammar guides in some parsable form, for supported languages? Perhaps Ispell can do some of this now, though - it does recognize some plurals, etc.  Not that I think that Emacs can't extend to that point someday.  But there are a lot of problems to be overcome before this could become a reality, I should think.  I would be interested in hearing how this could be implemented. -- CharlesSebold

: Quite a lot of languages have freely available part-of-speech analysers (see e.g. http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/List_of_dictionaries) and even disambiguators; one good thing here is that change-gender and pluralise-word would give some hint as to the part-of-speech (in many languages, only nouns can undergo those changes). Where there is more than one possibility (two possible ways of pluralising the noun, or it's noun-verb ambiguous && in a language where both can pluralise), I guess the best course of action would be to simply show both possibilities. So, not impossible, if you find a way of integrating some external resources. -- Unhammer
