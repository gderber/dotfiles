I've used Emacs for a few years, mostly on Windows PCs, since the Lucid days.  I like to tinker with it, still trying to get the 'perfect' .emacs file ("it's the journey that counts..."), learn how to use all the great packages it has, and trying to learn elisp programming when I get time, and of course doing a little promoting of Emacs amongst the other computer users I work with.

I help co-administer the help-emacs-windows mailing list on gnu.org with David Vanderschel.
And I made some of the icons used in the Windows version of Emacs - the stylized 3d gnu head to replace the old windows kitchen sink icon.
Now it's the nice cursive E in a ball but mine are still in the distribution.
