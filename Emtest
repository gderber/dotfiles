Emtest is a  modular, estensible testing framework for emacs.  It lives in a [http://savannah.nongnu.org/git/?group=emtest git repo] on Savannah.

It consists of these parts:
* The test-runner itself
* Multiple test-launchers:
** By function being tested
** By file
** By library
** By script for external programs, somewhat like %%DejaGNU%%, but in elisp instead of TCL.
* The test-report presenter
* A rich library of testhelp libraries:
** deep-type-checker
** match
** misc
** persist
** standard
** tagnames
** testpoint
** types
** mocks
*** dirtree
*** filebuf
*** libversion
* Editing help for writing tests
