I have been an Emacs user since the early 1980s when I briefly used Multics Emacs at the University of Birmingham (England). Since then I have used Prime Emacs on Prime minicomputers, Gosling Emacs on early Sun workstations, Lucid Emacs and for the last 15 years or so Gnu Emacs on various machines and operating systems.

I occasionally hack on bits of Elisp.
