This page is about '''[::Lisp]'''. It is about the ''language'' -- its dialects, behavior, properties, benefits, and idiosyncracies. It is '''''not''''' about Lisp tools, modes, programming tips, patterns, cliches, and such. Basic Lisp info (e.g. ListStructure) is OK.

::::::: LISP is worth learning for a different reason -- the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it. That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use LISP itself a lot. (You can get some beginning experience with LISP fairly easily by writing and modifying editing modes for the Emacs text editor.) -- Eric Raymond, ''How to Become a Hacker'' (http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)
