This mode really sucks as compared to GVim. Syntax highlighting, the main USP
of this mode, is really atrocious for any but the most simplistic markup. It
is beyond all comparison with the default TeX mode. Is Nroff-mode really an
orphan mode used only by manpage writers?

obviously in emacs Nroff-mode really is used only by manpage writers as we easily see regarding the 'preview as man page' option. Thus real nroff documents can't me previewed because the are lacking the typical manpage macros.
I hope  one day I'll find a better nroff-mode.el.
