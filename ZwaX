I've been using Emacs for 12 years or so.  What else do you want to know?

Hello and welcome.  We want to know your nick on #emacs, of course.
^_^ The RepetitionDetection stuff has caught me as well.  I hope you
don't mind be reworking the pages a bit in order to make them more
"web" style than "news" style. -- AlexSchroeder

Of course not.  I just got back in after a few hours out with friends
in the pub and was amazed to see such a nice reworking of what I had
written.  All the relevant information is still there, but without the
excess fluff around what I had written.  You appear to be doing an
excellent job.  I never even imagined that there would be a #emacs,
let alone having a nick there. -- ZwaX

Heh.  See InternetRelayChat...  As to editing "my" code -- you are
welcome.  The code pages on this wiki are like cheapo CVS with write
access for everyone.  And thanks for the nice words. -- as
