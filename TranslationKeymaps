See the section on "Translation Keymaps" in the EmacsManual for more information on this feature that can "translate certain event sequences into others during reading a key sequence".

To have `S-SPC' behave as `RET' key use

    (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "S-SPC") (kbd "RET"))

It seem that this is not possible with keyboard-translate, For example: 
<code>(keyboard-translate ?\C-t ?\C-f)</code> works.

However, none of these work.

   (keyboard-translate (kbd "S-SPC") [return])
   (keyboard-translate ?\s-SPC [return])
   (keyboard-translate ?\S-SPC [return])
   (keyboard-translate [?\S-SPC] [return])
   (keyboard-translate [(shift space)] [return])

The problem is discussed here: http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.help/80014
