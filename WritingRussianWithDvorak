As you know, all the cyrillic InputMethods work in a way that assumes your 
keyboard is in QWERTY layout. However, if you're using dvorak keyboard layout, 
you may discover that, for example, cyrillic-jcuken input method can't work
properly since all the ascii symbols on your keyboard are mapped to appropriate
cyrillic ones according to the qwerty->jcuken translation rules.

Thus, one of the possible solutions is to define your own input method which
translate symbols according to dvorak->jcuken rules.
Now all that your need is to Download:cyrillic-dvorak.el and put the following 
lines into your ~/.emacs file:

<pre>
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/cyrillic-dvorak.el")
(setq default-input-method "cyrillic-dvorak")
</pre>

== Keyboard Layout ==
You can as well define your keyboard layout via quail. Here is an example that defines two types of dvorak layout as well as chooses one of them.
<pre>
;; This is inteded to be used together with
;;
;;   setxkbmap -layout "us(dvp)"
;;

(eval-after-load 'quail
  '(progn
     (add-to-list 'quail-keyboard-layout-alist
       '("dvp" . "\
                              \
  %&7[5{3}1(9=0*2)4+6]8!`#    \
  ;:,<.>pPyYfFgGcCrRlL/?@^    \
  aAoOeEuUiIdDhHtTnNsS-_\\|    \
  '\"qQjJkKxXbBmMwWvVzZ        \
                              "))
     (add-to-list 'quail-keyboard-layout-alist
       '("dvorak" . "\
                              \
  1!2@3#4$5%6^7&8*9(0)[{]}`~  \
  '\",<.>pPyYfFgGcCrRlL/?=+    \
  aAoOeEuUiIdDhHtTnNsS-_\\|    \
  ;:qQjJkKxXbBmMwWvVzZ         \
                             "))
     (quail-set-keyboard-layout "dvp")))
