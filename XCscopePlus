== Introduction ==

CScope is a developer module for browsing source code, finding symbols...
 can be found here: http://cscope.sourceforge.net/

This file is an extension of xcscope.el

== What does this file provide ==

By default CScope will do an update of the database for each research. However
if you're working on a big project, an update can take times...
On the other hand you don't want to disable the update all the times.

This files provide function for easy mapping. Those function will temporary
disable the update for the current research.
