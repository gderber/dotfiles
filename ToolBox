The toolbox package allows you to call M-x toolbox to create a toolbox for
your current buffer.
The current buffer becomes the ''target'' for the toolbox.
In the toolbox, you put some elisp commands, and hit C-c C-c.
When you now click on them using the middle mouse button or RET,
the command will be run in the target buffer.

If you look at the example screenshot, you'll see how I put the the operations
I use most of the time in my toolbox, making it much simpler to switch drawing
ops in ArtistMode.
See [[Toolbox Screenshot]].
