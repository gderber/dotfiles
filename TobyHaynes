I've been editing, playing and programming Emacs for about 8 years now. Having been introduced to GNU Emacs courtesy of a well maintained distribution at University, I'm much more comfortable with the GNU side of the Emacs world.

Professionally, I'm involved in the development of DB2 UDB for IBM. But I also seem to have ended up being responsible for the GNU Emacs and XEmacs setup at my place of work through dint of being in the right place at the right time. It's a rough job but someone has to do it :-)
