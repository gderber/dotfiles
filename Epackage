== Description ==

Epackage refers to two terms:

* It is a DVCS repository with a suitable structure to implement the [[DELPS]] specification.
  In short: an Emacs extension (some `file.el`) wrapped in a Git repository, made publicly available e.g. through http://github.com
  and announced in a specific central *Sources List*, the "Yellow pages".
* It also refers to a reference implementation of the [[DELPS]]: ##epackage.el##.
  With it, you can download, install, remove and manage packages
  in a similar manner to [[ELPA]] package manager.

See [[DELPS]] page and its links for more information about how to make epackages and where to get ##epackage.el##.
