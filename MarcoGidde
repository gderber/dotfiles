I am an Emacs user and only every now and then start XEmacs to see
wether my quite voluminous .emacs (which is split into several files)
still works with both emacsen. Usually it does not because of some
byte compiled files and then I wish that at least one of those emacsen
had a configurable byte-compile-file-extension :-(

I have written the xgtags package which is mentioned on the GnuGlobal
page.

Welcome to the wiki! :) I have long ago given up on having a ~/.emacs file
that works for both emacsen. I used XEmacs so rarely that it basically
never worked whenever I tried it. -- AlexSchroeder

Late answer, I know :-) By now I also gave up with XEmacs, nowadays the
problem is more how to maintain a more or less identical configuration under
Ubuntu, !SuSE and Windows 7 - oh well ... :-)
