Inversion is a tool for testing version numbers on Emacs Lisp packages, and can be found as a part of the CollectionOfEmacsDevelopmentEnvironmentTools.

The latest version of Inversion can be downloaded from CVS:

[http://cedet.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/cedet/cedet/common/inversion.el inversion.el]

You can use inversion to load in a lisp package, as such:

<code>(inversion-require 'packagesym "1.0")</code>

If you have a package that breaks backward compatibility, you can specify an incompatible version number so that others using inversion can safely specify older versions that they require, for example:

<code>(defvar mypackage-incompatible-version "0.1alpha1")</code>

If you own a package, you can use inversion to put revision numbers in your output files (such as with EmacsLispObjects save files) to flush incompatible changes.
