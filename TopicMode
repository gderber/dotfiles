Topics are a nice way of structuring newsgroups in a hierarchy.
The nice thing is that you can use GroupParameters for Topics.
This way, you can for example set the ScoreFile for an entire topic -- for all the related newsgroups in the topic.

To toggle topic mode, use `t'.  To switch it on permanently, add the following to your ~/.gnus file:

 (add-hook 'gnus-group-mode-hook 'gnus-topic-mode)
