This page contains ideas for the next versions of Eicq I want to see.
SteveYoungs asked me to write them down to gain his motivation for further development. :)

=== contact management ===
* contacts should be arranged in arbitrary sets of subsets of the plain contacts list (I call them contact groups from now on)
* these contact groups should be flexible in arrangement (this implies it cannot be mapped to the icq server that way :/)
* with flexible I mean, they should just contain a reference to a specific contact (that'd allow to have a contact in multiple groups)
* the actual arrangement should depend on my current mood (that means there should be references from my current mood to a certain set of contact groups)

These thoughts are motivated from my habits that sometimes my business contacts are also private contacts, sending an amsg to all contacts of a specific groups becomes easier then.

=== scoring messages ===
* messages should get a score (similarly to the Gnus scoring)
* scoring of messages should depend on my current mood (often I hate these static rules in Gnus and therefore I have loads of rule sets)
* scoring should be done on any of the usual parameters (From, Keywords, Length, etc.)

Often it's nerving to have people that ask too much in too short time intervals, therefore I'd like to have something like a (semi-)ignore via scoring in order to concentrate on not so frequent but important talks.

=== moods ===
* as proposed within the last to sections, eicq should be `mood-driven'
* this may induce the idea to have the mood set automagically depending on other stuff (such as the score of messages, or inherited from the facts which people I communicate to)

Steve even suggested an eicq-moodwatch-mode. Personally I think that's the biggest idea ever :).

=== Gnus backend ===
* Make possible to write gnus backend to view/group/score/sort/archive messages arrived in eicq.
* Make possible to use native eicq interface and gnus backend at the same time.

It is great when all your messaging like mail/news/icq performes in same manner.
