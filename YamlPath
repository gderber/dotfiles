<code>yaml-path.el</code> provides a function to display a Ruby expression (or an xpath-like string) for the yaml element on the current line. It's meant to complement Yoshiki Kurihara's YamlMode.

Get it at http://alpheus.me/src/emacs/yaml-path/yaml-path.el
(The link was broken. After some search, I guess this is the "official" link: https://github.com/craig-ludington/yaml-path/blob/master/yaml-path.el)

<code>yaml-path.el</code> doesn't strictly depend on yaml-mode, but works better with yaml-mode.  (That's because yaml-mode makes syntax-ppss usable for locating comments.)

The functions provided are: 
* yaml-path/path
** displays an xpath-like string for the current element
* yaml-path/display-ruby-expression 
** displays ruby syntax for the current element
* yaml-path/display-ruby-invocation 
** displays a ruby command-line that loads the file, selects and prints the element

It's convenient to bind one of them a key, e.g. C-c C-p.
Instructions for doing that are inside <code>yaml-path.el</code>
