Debian's VIM maintainer [http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2008/10/from_Vim_to_Emacs_-_part_1/ tries Emacs for a month] to see if he finds it better than VIM.

If you're interested then follow his progress and help him out if he's stuck. Could be a good case study for future converts who consider switching. :) -- TamasPatrovics
