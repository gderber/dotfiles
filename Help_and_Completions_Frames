The <code>*Help*</code> [[buffer]] is treated specially in several minor
ways in Emacs. I decided to give it its own [[frame]] style and display
function. I added this frame definition to
`special-display-buffer-names'.

Here's a screenshot of the <code>*Help*</code> frame:

I did the same thing for the <code>*Completions*</code>
buffer. Here's a screenshot of the <code>*Completions*</code>frame: 

[[image:DrewsEmacsCompletionsFrameImage]]


However, in this case, the display function I use also does
this:

  (redirect-frame-focus (selected-frame) 1on1-minibuffer-frame)

That makes the <code>*Completions*</code> frame redirect user actions
to the [[minibuffer]] frame, `1on1-minibuffer-frame', which is the behavior we need for
<code>*Completions*</code>.

Several [[user option]]s are available for customizing the appearance of these frames. In particular, the `*Completions*' frame is automatically zoomed out, to make its text slightly smaller than normal, and you can customize this zoom amount (using option `1on1-completions-frame-zoom-font-difference').

'''See Also: [[Icicles]]''' for a discussion of the frame-focus problem that this frame redirection solves.
