Well I'm an Xemacs user. I used to be an Emacs user, but i got sick and tired of having to manage
my own packages. You cannot travel light with an environment that demands you have megs of lisp files 
hanging around just to use JDE or whatever. Now using Xemacs on win32 and linux, never looked back.

Well now i've moved back to Emacs 24, because of the package support. for those interested.
