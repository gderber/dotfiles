== Traversing Minibuffer Histories ==

Perhaps you are already used to accessing past inputs with vanilla Emacs using the `down' and `up' arrow keys (or `M-n', `M-p', and `next').  If not, try it (not in ''Icicle'' mode).
You can go backward and forward in the [[minibuffer]] histories (there
are different history lists for different kinds of input).  You
cannot really cycle them (with wraparound), but when you get to one end you can
reverse the direction of traversal.

Anyway, the input-[[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]] behavior that '''Icicles''' offers is in ''addition'' to this standard
traversal of histories.  Since there are, by default, several extra 
pairs of keys used for history traversal, rebinding some of
them to use for '''Icicles''' [[completion]] is no real loss.  

By default, '''Icicles'''
rebinds the arrow keys `down' and `up' for current-mode completion cycling.  '''Icicles''' also rebinds `end' and
`home' for prefix-completion cycling, and `next' and `prior' for [[apropos completion]]
cycling.  But you still have `M-n' and `M-p' available to
access past inputs (history).  And the rebindings are only for
minibuffer input; ''global bindings are not affected''.

You can at any time switch back and forth between input-history
traversal (`M-n', `M-p') and completion cycling (`down', `up', `next', `prior', `end', `home').

cycling
