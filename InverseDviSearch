== Introduction ==
Inverse search in DVI file means that
* A mouse click in the DVI previewer window can open an editor with the corresponding place in the (La)!TeX source (also called '''reverse search'''), and
* DVI previewer can jump to (and visually highlight) a position in the DVI file that corresponds to a certain line number in the (La)!TeX source file ('''forward search''').

Inverse Search is a feature of the xdvi program, not of emacs. Inverse Search
is the ability of the dvi viewer to call an external editor to display the
source of the dvi file. Hence, the main source of information concerning
this feature is the xdvi man page and web site [http://xdvi.sourceforge.net/].

If Inverse Search is enabled, a Control-click in the xdvi window
should call an editor to edit the source. The next section
explains how to specify emacs as the default editor for displaying
the source file.

== Inverse search and emacs ==
 
There are several ways to specify the editor that should display the source
corresponding to the dvi file.

* set editor in .Xressource

* set  environment variable

* set  preference in the xdvi window

* specify the editor when starting xdvi from the command line

On X window, you can specify a default editor in your .Xresource file by 
putting the following line in that file

  xdvi.editor: emacsclient -a emacs --no-wait +%l %f

If there is no such default, 
xdvi checks the following variables to find which command 
should be launched to display the source of the dvi file :
the <code>editor</code> Xressource, <code>XEDITOR</code>, 
<code>VISUAL</code>, <code>EDITOR</code>.
You can set the EDITOR variable by typing in a terminal
running bash

  export EDITOR="emacsclient --alternate-editor=emacs --no-wait +%l %f"

A Control-Click on the dvi file will either use an already running emacs
session to display or update the source file, or start a new emacs to
edit the source.

Alternatively, from the xdvi menu-bar <code>Options > Preferences</code>,
select <code>Helper Applications</code> and click on the menu entitled
<code>Editor for Source Specials</code>. Select the line

   emacsclient --no-wait +%l %f

if it exists, or create it.
  
Finalliy, xdvi can be started from the command line with the following option

  xdvi -editor 'emacsclient --no-wait -a emacs'

You must start a server if you want to use an already running emacs session.
Type <code>M-x server-start</code> in emacs to start the server, or put the
line <code>(server-start)</code> in your InitFile. See EmacsClient or 
GnuClient for more details.

== Inverse Search and TeX modes ==

Several modes have shortcuts to start automatically the dvi viewer, when
editing TeX files.

=== The default TeX mode ===

In the mode used by default to edit TeX or LaTeX files, the command
that starts the viewer is called <code>TeX-view-command</code>.
You can put the following in your Initfile to start xdvi with
the <code>editor</code> switch set to emacsclient.

  (tex-dvi-view-command "xdvi -editor 'emacsclient -a emacs --no-wait +%l %f'")

=== Auctex mode, version < 10.85 ===

In version of auctex previous to 10.85, the list that holds the command
for compilation and viewing is called <code>TeX-output-view-style</code>.
This is where you can specify the options of the xdvi command called by
emacs. Put the following in your InitFile to set the <code>editor</code>
option.

   (add-hook 'TeX-view-style '("." "xdvi -editor 'emacsclient --no-wait' %d"))

Additional options can be set there: offsets, zoom ratio, geometry etc.

=== Auctex mode, recent version ===

In recent versions of auctex, Inverse search can be enabled
just by putting the following in the InitFile

   (setq TeX-source-specials-mode 1)                    ;; auctex 10.85

or 

   (setq TeX-source-correlate-method 'source-specials)  ;; auctex 10.86  
   (TeX-source-correlate-mode)         

Auctex then asks whether to start a server if necessary. You may add the 
following in your InitFile if you want the server to be started without 
query. 

   (setq TeX-source-specials-view-start-server t)

You can also add the following line to your InitFile, to prevent emacs from
asking for confirmation when starting the dvi viewer.

   (add-to-list 'TeX-command-list '("View" "%V" TeX-run-discard nil t))

Starting with auctex 11.85, the list that holds the 
commands for compilation and viewing is called 
<code>TeX-output-view-style</code>.
This is where options can be modified. For example, 
the <code>-watchfile 1</code> option will update the dvi file
after each successful compilation. You can enable it by putting
in your InitFile

   (add-to-list 'TeX-output-view-style 
        '("^dvi$" "." 
          "%(o?)xdvi -watchfile 1 %dS %d"))



== Producing TeX files for inverse search ==
To use !InverseDviSearch the DVI file has to be prepared in such a way that it includes '''source specials'''. They can be inserted via a macro package or a command-line option to the (La)TeX program (executable).

* Preferred option is to use !TeX binary which includes the necessary information automatically. Usually there is command line switch which does the job, e.g. use <code>tex --src-specials myfile.tex</code> or <code>latex --src-specials myfile.tex</code>. You can pass this option to !TeX binary in the (La)TeX file, using magic first line, if this feature is present and turned on in your !LaTeX distribution.
* You can use macro packages, <tt>srctex.sty</tt> or <tt>srcltx.sty</tt>, from <tt>[http://www.ctan.org/getmirror/?filename=macros/latex/contrib/srcltx/&#38;action=/getfile/&#38;catstring=macros/latex/contrib/srcltx/ CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/srcltx/]</tt>. Include it in LaTeX file using <code>\usepackage[active]{srcltx}</code>, and in TeX file using <code>\include{srctex}</code>.

While the macro version might interact badly with other macro
packages, the option for the (La)TeX executable should be more robust.
However, both versions may affect the line breaks of your document, so
it's generally a good idea to disable source specials for the final
version of the document.


== Forward Search ==
Use <tt>xdvi-search.el</tt> for xdvi(k), <tt>kdvi-search.el</tt> for KDVI (provided with those DVI previewers). See the files for details.

AUCTeX supports forward and inverse search in your DVI search via toggling `TeX-source-specials-mode'. You can set `TeX-source-specials-view-start-server' variable.

Here is how to do a forward search with Auctex: 
just type <code>C-c C-c</code>. If no change has been done since last call to
<code>C-c C-c</code>, this executes the View command, which updates the dvi
file, going to the page matching the position of the cursor in the source file.
You can activate the View command at any time 
with the shortcut <code>C-c C-v</code>.

== Dvi previewers capable of inverse search ==
* KDVI, http://developer.kde.org/~kdvi/
* xdvi(k), http://xdvi.sourceforge.net/
* Yap (from !MikTeX)
* DocViewMode ? (Can it do this? It seems like it really ought to but I've not figured out how yet)

== Notes on the dvi-previewers ==
=== Problem: Black pages with xdvik under cygwin ===
Under cygwin it may be that xdvik only shows black pages when it is started with the option -sourceposition from within emacs. In this case it may help to set

xdvi*fork: false

in the ~/.Xdefaults file. See the manual page of xdvi for details.
