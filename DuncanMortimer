Emacs interests:
* Apart from some early experiences in undergrad, I'm a recent convert to emacs.  Now I wonder why I didn't start learning how to use it properly ages ago!
* I principally use it for writing LaTeX, and for my (currently not-quite-habitual) GTD system using org-mode.  More recently, I've become interested in trying to contribute a bit more to the emacs community.  
* A lot of my enthusiasm has come from reading SachaChua's blog.  Thanks Sacha!
* I've recently written a (very rough) "write-or-die" minor mode, based on Dr Wicked's excellent web-app (http://lab.drwicked.com/writeordie.html); see WriteOrDieMode.

I principally use Aquamacs.

Welcome to the wiki! I guess I was lucky -- at the time I started reading mail, all that we had at the university was a telnet connection, and on the server we only had the choice of vi, pico, or Emacs. That made it easy for me to pick the right editor. :) -- AlexSchroeder
