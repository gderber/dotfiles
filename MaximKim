Welcome To the wiki.

Nope, no login no password just fill your name. --PierreGaston

Ok. Got it. --MaximKim


I wish emacs had _find-in-files_ stuff built in. Grep and findstr can't help here as my emacs lives in Windows environment. And its console knows nothing about unicode.

I've noticed that if you use eshell, and issue a ##grep foo *## command, and you don't have a grep binary on your system, it will use ##eshell-poor-mans-grep##. Perhaps you can bind that to a key if you need it? Personally, I just install many command line tools via Cygwin. -- AlexSchroeder

The ports of grep etc that comes from /GnuWin32/ works very well most of the time.
They are included in [[EmacsW32]] -- LennartBorgman

Grep in Eshell! Thanks! It can search strings in different encodings. --MaximKim
