== About ==

Emacs Wiki Journal provides a journal environment based on EmacsWikiMode, supports RSS, calendar and archive links since it groups entries by month. It is a modified version from [http://www15.ocn.ne.jp/~rodinia/emacs-wiki-journal.el Yamagata Yoriyukiâ€™s emacs-wiki-journal].

== Download and Usage ==

Get the latest version from here:

* https://github.com/lalawue/emacs-wiki-journal

Uncompress it, change its name to emacs-wiki-journal.el and move it to your load-path, and add the following to your .emacs:

<code>
(require 'emacs-wiki-journal)
</code>

After that, just type `M-x emacs-wiki-journal-add-entry' to begin your journal. It's very easy to use.

If you want to add calendar and achive links to your published file's sidebar, please edit your journal's `emacs-wiki-publishing-header' (or `emacs-wiki-purlishing-footer'), add the appropriate function. For more information, see the commentary in the file itself.

Here are my emacs-wiki and emacs-wiki-journal config files to use as examples:

# [http://suchang.net/code/emacs-wiki-conf.el.htm emacs-wiki-conf.el]
# [http://suchang.net/code/.site-header.htm .site-header]
# [http://suchang.net/code/.site-footer.htm .site-footer]
# [http://suchang.net/code/.blog-header.htm .blog-header]
# [http://suchang.net/code/.blog-footer.htm .blog-footer]

I also maintain a [http://suchang.net/cs/EmacsWikiJournal.html Chinese page dedicated to EmacsWikiJournal]. If you have any problem or suggestion, contact me at suchaaa at gmail dot com.
