I am a long time Xemacs user that switched to Emacs (in 2008!) for the SVN support (throw rocks elsewhere).

I've played quite a bit with both of those to make them behave as a regular "file manager" user would expect: double-click on a file and it opens in a new window. Close the file closes the window. Sound simple? Quite hackish in emacs. See EmacsClient.

People can look for me on a few other wikis, mostly https://wiki.koumbit.net/TheAnarcat or my own website, https://anarc.at/

I like this wiki very much.
