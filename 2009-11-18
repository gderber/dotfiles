The completion display of [IdeBridge this emacs C# completion package] is pretty nifty, eh? Check out the screenshots: http://code.google.com/p/idebridge/wiki/ScreenShots


Can you guess how he can show such a nice looking graphical completion list without looking at the source code? :)

It looks impressive. -- AlexSchroeder

Yes, we can guess ... even if the guess is wrong, perhaps ... ;-)

Seems to be a direct challenge to Toby C and his Completion UI stuff... :) -- MaDa

I think it is more an alternative that fits into a framework like CompletionUI or CompanyMode.

And of course such an alternative using external programs for popup is not always available.
Wonder how it synchs with Emacs? What happens if one switches frame?

It would be very easy to built this in Emacs if something like wxWidgets could be integrated on Emacs GUI platforms. But that integration might be very difficult though.

It’s easy to add new user-interfaces to CompletionUI. Once you’ve got the code that implements the interface, all it needs is a call to <code>completion-ui-register-interface</code>. Care to attempt this? --TobyCubitt
