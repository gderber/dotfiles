I'd like to see some attention paid to backward compatibility.

For example, 24.5 has changed (newline), requiring me to discover its use of electric-indent-mode, so that I could get (newline) to behave as it did in 24.3.

I'm tired of chasing changes every time I move to a new version.

You have to read the NEWS file (C-h n) after you install a new version of emacs.
