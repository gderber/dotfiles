<code>info-xref.el</code> checks external cross references in info
files, by having Emacs attempt to visit the nodes specified.

<code>makeinfo</code> checks references internal to a document
when it processes a <code>.texi</code> file, but not external references, so it's it rather easy for mistakes to creep in or node name changes to go unnoticed.

This package is included in Emacs 22 and it works in GnuEmacs 21, too.

<code>M-x info-xref-check</code> checks one file.  When invoked from
an InfoMode or [[Texinfo]] buffer, the current or corresponding <code>.info</code> file
is the default at the prompt.  See comments in
<code>info-xref.el</code> for more commands.

The results of checking are shown in a buffer.  The format is a bit
rough, but there's not normally many problems, and correcting them is
a manual process anyway, a case of finding the right spot in the
original .texi and finding or deciding what node it ought to point to.
