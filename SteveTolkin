I am Steve Tolkin, aka Steven Tolkin.  I use emacs on Windows (currently Windows XP).  I use perl.  I am a software architect.  My home page is home.comcast.net/~tolkin.family  This includes (among other items) an academic paper describing the Taxir system, which I believe was the earliest use of bit strings to store data.
