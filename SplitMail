You can split incoming mails using nnmail-split-methods.  The Gnus manual comes with nice examples.

Here's a simple example that shows how to list specific email addresses without writing the regexp yourself, and how to do a simple spam filter:

 (setq nnmail-split-methods 
       (list
	;; Mailing lists that don't list my name in the headers
	(list "mail.misc" (concat "^From:.*" (regexp-opt 
	  '("Jakob Nielsen"
	    "some.list@lists.com") 1)))
	;; Mails from myself and to myself
	(list "mail.misc" (concat "^\\(From\\|To\\|Cc\\):.*" 
				  gnus-ignored-from-addresses))
	;; The rest is spam
	'("mail.spam" "")))

See IgnoredFromAddresses for an example of how to specify what your mail addresses are.

See RegexpOpt for more info on optimizing regular expressions.  Note that the code above uses the optional second parameter to regexp-opt -- that will put a level of parenthesis around all the matching names.

Without extra parenthesis the initial "From" applies only to the first name.
This will result in mails being split into the wrong folders.

   "^From:.*Jakob Nielsen\\|some\\.list@lists\\.com"

With extra parenthesis everything works as expected.

   "^From:.*\\(Jakob Nielsen\\|some\\.list@lists\\.com\\)"

Note that when several entries match, mail can end up in several
folders.  If you don't want that, set nnmail-crosspost to nil.

   (setq nnmail-crosspost nil)

You can test respooling by using `B t' in the summary buffer before
using `B r' (and choosing nnml as the backend!).  If you want to
respool lots of mails, mark them all with the process mark, first.
Use `#' for that.

== Problems ==

I think something more needs to be said here.  I tried the example
above, and respooling works properly, but INITIAL spooling never
happens.  I have several mail sources, FWIW.  None of the gnus
documentation seems to cover how to get all my inboxes split without
manually doing respooling.

It should do so automatically, if Gnus fetches the files from a mail
spool (/var/mail/username) or from the net using POP, for example.  If
you use some other means, such as procmail distributing mail to other
files, then you must do splitting via procmail.  The important thing
is that you get mail via gnus-secondary-select-methods. --

Well, I figured it out, but I don't know if it is right.  I do this:

(add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnml ""))
(setf mail-sources
      '((file)
	(directory :path "mypath" :suffix ".fy"))))

And this:

(setf nnmail-resplit-incoming t)
(setf nnmail-crosspost nil)

And it seems to work.  Funny that you don't specify which inboxes to split when you set nnmail-split-*.
