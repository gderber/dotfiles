Originally written by KragenJavierSitaker.  Is there a simpler way to do this?  Is this code already written somewhere?  I know it doesn't take character width into account, and it should.

    (defun underline-line-with (char)
      (save-excursion
        (let ((length (- (point-at-eol) (point-at-bol))))
          (end-of-line)
          (insert "\n")
          (insert (make-string length char)))))
    (defun underline-line ()
      (interactive)
      (underline-line-with ?-))
    (defun double-underline-line ()
      (interactive)
      (underline-line-with ?=))
    (global-set-key [(control meta _)] 'underline-line)
    (global-set-key [(control meta =)] 'double-underline-line)
