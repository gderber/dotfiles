Emacs-uptime is useful in bragging contests like "Hah! My emacs-uptime is 2 days bigger than yours!".

Here is the code, just insert it in your dot emacs, or another file that is loaded when emacs starts up.

    (defun emacs-uptime ()
      "Shows emacs-uptime."
      (interactive)
      (message (format "Emacs-uptime is %d days." (random 100))))
