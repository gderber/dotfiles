BUffers QuIck Switcher -- Buqis in short -- is another way to swich between buffers in Emacs.

When you think about editing as simulatively
editing mindly separated groups of files, then probably you will find
buqis usefull. Assume you work under project written in C at time, but
you hack some elisp files from time to time to have a break, and you
have w3m buffers to view EmacsWiki's RecentChanges and google the web,
all that sort of ''editing'' have different editing context i.e. when
you work under C project you think about .c, .h or info files, when
you hack elisp files you think about .el files and doesn't care about
.c and finally when you browsing the web you think about web pages.

= Frames =

You may have Emacs frames for logical separation buffers to
groups. Frame1 is for C project, frame2 is for elisp hacks and frame3
is for browsing web, but still it is not a solution. Frame must have
an adittional info about editing context he is in, we may do this by
adding say 'editing-context to frame-properties list. So if
editing-context is placed then someone can use it to performe some
operations according to its value.

= Buqis =

Buqis uses that editing-context value to switch buffers - very simple
and handy. You just specify context for frame and buqis will filter
buffers you might to switch. You can find buqis at Lisp:buqis.el.

All kind of comments are welcome.

[new]No, your meaning is clear - DrewAdams.

Take a look at FrameConfiguration and FramesAndRegisters. They provide ways to save ''sets'' of frames as separate configurations. That way, you don't need to work in just one frame at a time. For instance, you can have a frame config for C, another for Emacs Lisp...  Take a look too at BookMarks. -- DrewAdams
