[[ja:ログを保存する]]
The following is a simple example of using Emacs hooks.  It logs /all/ buffer saves to a log file.
The log file is currently written to ##saves## in [[.emacs.d]]--a location where the `auto-save-list' data
is also stored.

The save log is generated when Emacs quits.  That behavior could obviously be modified.

  (defvar save-log-log-file "~/.emacs.d/saves")
  (defvar save-log-alist nil)
  (defvar save-log-date-format "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

  (defun save-log-add-file (file)
    "Add the file FILE to the log."
    (let ((date-time (format-time-string save-log-date-format)))
      (setq save-log-alist (append save-log-alist
				   (list (list file date-time))))))

  (defun save-log-write-log-file (file) 
    "Write save log file to FILE."
    (with-temp-file file
      (if (file-exists-p file)
	  (insert-file-contents file))
      ;; Assumed: (goto-char (point-max))  
      (mapcar (lambda (file-and-date)
		(insert (cadr file-and-date) " "
			(car file-and-date) "\n"))
	      save-log-alist))
    (message (format "Save log saved: %s" file)))

  (defun save-log-after-save-hook ()
    (save-log-add-file buffer-file-truename))

  (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'save-log-after-save-hook)

  (defun save-log-kill-emacs-hook ()
    (save-log-write-log-file save-log-log-file))

  (add-hook 'kill-emacs-hook 'save-log-kill-emacs-hook)

Here is an example ##~/.emacs.d/saves## file:
