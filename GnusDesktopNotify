[[ja:ニューズ_デスクトップ通知]]
GnusDesktopNotify is a global minor mode that displays desktop notifications in response to new group messages. It's usually used in conjunction with GnusDemon to periodically scan for new emails. GnusDesktopNotify uses the `notifications' library included in emacs 24 (if available) or execute  <code>notify-send</code> on emacs 23 and earlier. Group names can be collapsed automatically, and individual groups can be included/excluded from generating notifications. You can also select whether to generate an individual notification for each group, or collapse all groups in a single notification.

GnusDesktopNotify can be downloaded at [http://www.thregr.org/~wavexx/hacks/gnus-desktop-notify/]. Usage instructions can be found on the web site and in the source.
