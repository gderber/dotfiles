I am happy emacs user and like to customize my emacs configuration files:) I use emacs in school and at work mostly for programming. I like java, c/c++ and python and will never stop using them.

: Welcome to the wiki!  I'm not sure I'd wish for "never stop using" C, C++, or Java...  Brrrrr!  ;) -- AlexSchroeder
