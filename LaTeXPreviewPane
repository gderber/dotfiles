== Installing LaTeX Preview Pane == 

To install latex-preview-pane you will need the following:

* A installed copy of Emacs 24+ with a working packages system
* The command pdflatex on your PATH
* Access to the MELPA package repository

If you don't already have MELPA installed, add the following snippet to your .emacs file and either restart emacs or simply <code>eval-region</code> the snippet. 

{{{
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
  '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
}}}

To install latex-preview-pane, simply execute <code>M-x package-install latex-preview-pane</code> and restart Emacs.

== Using LaTeX Preview Pane ==

If you would like latex-preview-pane to load automatically with your LaTeX files, add the following to your .emacs:

{{{
(latex-preview-pane-enable)
}}}

Otherwise, you can enable it on a per-buffer basis with the command:
{{{
M-x latex-preview-pane-mode
}}}

To use LaTeX Preview Pane, simply open any TeX file and if latex-preview-pane is set to be automatically enabled, it will open a preview pane and attempt to generate your TeX preview. Otherwise you can activate it with <code>M-x latex-preview-pane-mode</code> to open the preview pane. Note that there is also a menu in this mode which contains the following functions:
* Refresh Preview (bound to M-p)
* Open in External Program (Bound to M-P)
* Disable LaTeX Preview Pane (turns the mode off, you can also use <code> M-x latex-preview-pane-mode</code> to toggle it off.
* Customize LaTeX Preview Pane (opens a customization buffer where you can set the command to use for generating previews)
