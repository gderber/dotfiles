Speck is a minor Emacs mode for on-the-fly spell checking. It differs from the existing modes (ispell, flyspell) in the
following aspects:

* Speck checks the spelling of a word if and only if the word is
      actually displayed in an Emacs window.  There are no separate
      commands to check the spelling of a single word, region, or the
      entire buffer.

* Speck's operations are triggered by an idle timer.  In practice
      this means that spelling is checked only when you pause typing.

* You can set up Speck to use different dictionaries for disjoint
      stretches of text in one and the same buffer.

* Speck preserves dictionary and other settings on a per-buffer
      basis.  Hence you can check the spelling of several buffers
      simultaneously, without losing your settings or introducing
      mutual side-effects.

* Dictionary and other settings can be saved to the file you're
      visiting and you can resume editing with restored settings.

== Setup on Windows, by example ==

# Install Hunspell from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/ ezwinports] into: <code>C:\ezwinports</code>

# Make sure that <code>C:\ezwinports\bin</code> is in <code>%PATH%</code>.

# Download <code>es_ES.oxt</code> from the !LibreOffice [http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/spanish-dictionaries extensions repository].

# Rename <code>es_ES.oxt</code> to <code>es_ES.zip</code>, and unpack its contents into: <code>C:\ezwinports\share\hunspell</code>

# Customize <code>speck-hunspell-program</code> to: <code>"C:\\ezwinports\\bin\\hunspell.exe"</code>

# Customize <code>speck-hunspell-library-directory</code> to: <code>""</code>

# Customize <code>speck-hunspell-dictionary-alist</code> to: <code>(("en" . "en_US") ("es" . "es_ES"))</code>
