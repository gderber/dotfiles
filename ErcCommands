--------------------
ERC allows you to add your own commands as well.  As long as you provide a defun with a name like erc-cmd-XXXX, then /XXXX (or /xxxx) will call that command.  You can get a picture of what some of those should look like in erc.el, and on this wiki.  Look at NowPlaying, for example.
A final t is used to inform the calling function that everything went fine.  If a erc-cmd-XXXX function returns nil, erc reports "Bad syntax" or a similar message.
