The HttpGet that is builtin to Emacs didn't work for me, on Windows.

So I produced an alternative.  It's one module, with one exported defun.  It is not nearly as full-featured as the url browsing stuff in emacs23.  But it works, simply. 

Lisp:httpgetwin32.el

This elisp depends on an external wget program.  If you don't have one, you can download the source and build it for yourself, from:  [[https://CheesoExamples.svn.codeplex.com/svn/wget/wget.cs  wget.cs]]

To compile *that*:

{{{
    csc.exe /t:exe /out:wget.exe wget.cs
}}}

The elisp module should also work on non-Windows platforms. In all cases, you need to set the location of a wget program suitably.
