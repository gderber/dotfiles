== About ==

My name is Yoni Rabkin. I've been using GNU/Emacs ever since I've started using GNU/Linux years ago and have never looked back. I used Emacs to edit my first Linux file when I tried to connect my new GNU/Linux box to the Internet for the first time. I had first read about Emacs in Philip Greenspun's book "Philip and Alex's guide to Web publishing".

I have a few patches in GNU/Emacs.

I maintain the [[EMMS]] project, I wrote parts of it and use it daily. I also (re)wrote most of the Emms manual and designed the logo.

I organize my life using text files in GNU/Emacs and a few simple rules. I'd write more about my technique if anyone asked.

You can occasionally find me on irc.freenode.net in #fsf, #fsf-members, #gnu, etc. as [::yrk].

[http://yrk.rabkins.net My homepage] has a bit more info.

== Emacs Hacking ==

=== analog-clock.el ===
I wrote [http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/analog-clock/analog-clock.el analog-clock.el]. It is an animated analog clock (Seven-Segment or turny) for your temporal enjoyment. It should be in GNU/Emacs proper.

=== vernacular-time.el ===
I wrote [http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/vernacular-time/vernacular-time.el vernacular-time.el] to display times stamps in Emacs in the vernacular. It has a useful Dired mode to transform "ls" time stamps.

=== slime-cl-pitfalls.el ===
SLIME, the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs, displays a MOTD type encouragement when loaded. With [http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/slime-cl-pitfalls/slime-cl-pitfalls.el slime-cl-pitfalls.el] you will instead be treated with a randomly selected Common Lisp pitfall for your edification.

=== rt-liberation.el ===
rt-liberation is a GNU/Emacs interface to the [http://bestpractical.com/rt/ RT] system. I wrote and use it every day in order to avoid using a browser and an HTML Web interface to RT. It integrates with Gnus and it's also convenient for zapping spam tickets on public-facing RT queues. It comes with a Lisp domain specific language for writing Ticket-SQL queries. [http://www.nongnu.org/rtliber/ get it through Savannah].

If you work with RT and hang around IRC, you might also be interested in [http://yrk.nfshost.com/projects/queue-status/ Queue-Status].

Bug reports and patches are welcome. Happy hacking.


== General Emacs Tips ==

=== auto-revert ===

Do the following to stop auto-revert tail mode from spamming you every time a file changes:
<code>(setq auto-revert-verbose nil)</code>
