There is an EmacsScreenshots group on [http://www.flickr.com/groups/emacs/ flickr].

The group is open, you can freely post your screenshots.  The purpose of this group was first to give a quick glance at some of the ColorTheme, but you're welcome to post any screenshot showing your Emacs in action.  Enjoy!
