This is the successor of ReallySimpleWikiMode and got integrated into EmacsHttp.
See WikiModes for comparisons.
All it does is add a keybinding to insert some tags, and the hilighting of
tags plus <nowiki>WikiNames</nowiki>.  If you are editing wiki pages
within Emacs, this is quite elegant.

* simple-wiki.el is now [http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/*checkout*/http-emacs/http-emacs/simple-wiki.el?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/plain hosted on Savannah]

== Usage ==

This requires two steps:

Getting the wiki page into Emacs: Some browsers allow you to define
an external editor for text areas.  This is where you must set emacs,
emacsclient, or gnuclient as your editor.

Activating simple-wiki-mode for these pages: This usually exploits
some naming convention for the browser's temporary files.  Here is an
example for w3m:

    (require 'simple-wiki)
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("w3mtmp" . simple-wiki-mode))

In addition, if you are using GNU Emacs, you have to add the following
to your init file:

    (require 'cl)

== Tags ==

Use the following code to have `C-c C-t' insert tags.

    (autoload 'sgml-tag "sgml-mode" t)
    (define-key simple-wiki-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-t") 'sgml-tag)

If you are using PsgmlMode, beware of name conflicts and help fix the
situation.

== Quotes ==

If you are using OpeningQuote, add:

    (add-hook 'simple-wiki-mode-hook
              (lambda ()
                (local-set-key (kbd "'") 'maybe-open-apostrophe)))

== Filling ==

This is what I often use:

    (add-hook 'simple-wiki-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
