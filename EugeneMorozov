I'm an experienced Emacs user. I know elisp a bit (even wrote a mode for spamassassin, though it's not available online now).

: Hello and welcome!  I must resume my Japanese studies...  I would really like to find some Japanese friends in the area so I can practice, perhaps that would help.  ATM I am studying all by myself with some tapes and a book.  And Emacs.  :) -- AlexSchroeder
