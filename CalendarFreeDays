I like when freedays shown as holidays in calendar.  But I does not found such feature in CalendarMode (bad search?).  So here quick and dirty workauround.  This stuff need enhancement, it will work only if week starts from Monday :)

Week starts from Monday:

    (setq calendar-week-start-day 1)

Define face to highlight freedays:

    (defface mycal-freeday-face nil nil)
    (set-face-background 'mycal-freeday-face "pink")

Action:

    (defun mycal-hightlight-free-day (date &optional face)
      "Highlight DATE with FACE if DATE is free-day.
    Default face is `mycal-freeday-face'."
      (when (and (calendar-date-is-visible-p date)
                 (member (calendar-day-of-week date) '(0 6)))
        (save-excursion
          (calendar-goto-date date)
          (if (fboundp 'set-extent-properties)
	      (set-extent-properties (make-extent (1- (point)) (1+ (point)))
				     (list 'face (or face 'mycal-freeday-face)
					   'priority -1))
	    (set-text-properties (1- (point)) (1+ (point))
				 (list 'face (or face 'mycal-freeday-face)
				       'priority -1))))
        ))
    
    (defun mycal-mark-freedays ()
      "Scan Calendar buffer and highlight freedays.
    Prefix ARG specifies number of weeks to highlight."
      (interactive)

      (save-excursion
        (beginning-of-buffer)

        ;; Process first week
        (calendar-end-of-week 1)
        (let* ((date (calendar-cursor-to-nearest-date))
               (day (car (cdr date))))
          (when (> day 7)
            (calendar-backward-week 1))
          ;; Refresh date and day
          (setq date (calendar-cursor-to-nearest-date))
          (setq day (car (cdr date)))
          (mycal-hightlight-free-day date)

          (unless (= day 1)
            (calendar-backward-day 1)
            (mycal-hightlight-free-day (calendar-cursor-to-nearest-date))
            (calendar-end-of-week 1)))

        ;; Process other monthes
        (let* ((date (calendar-cursor-to-nearest-date))
               (absdate (+ 6 (calendar-absolute-from-gregorian date)))
               (gregd (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute absdate)))
          (while (calendar-date-is-visible-p gregd)
            (mycal-hightlight-free-day gregd)

            (setq gregd (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute (+ absdate 1)))
            (mycal-hightlight-free-day gregd)

            (setq absdate (+ 7 absdate))
            (setq gregd (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute absdate))))
        ))

Advice `mark-calendar-holidays' to highlight freedays:

    (defadvice mark-calendar-holidays (after highlight-free-days activate)
      "Highlight freedays as well."
      (mycal-mark-freedays))
