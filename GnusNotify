[[gnus-notify.el]] is a mode that display gnus news number at mode-line. Combined with [[GnusDemon]], it warns you when you receive new mails or when there are new news to read. Clicking the modeline brings you to corresponding summary buffer. 

There are several alternatives, see GnusNotificationComparison.

==How to use gnus-notify.el==
gnus-notify allows you to select which groups you want to include in the report; it does this via a „group parameter“ you have to add manually.

To do it: use ##G p## in the group buffer, then add ##(modeline-notify t)## to the list there; if it were the only property, it would look like this: ##((modeline-notify t))##
