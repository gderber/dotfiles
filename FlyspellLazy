==Overview==

Improve flyspell responsiveness using idle timers.

==flyspell-lazy==

`flyspell-mode' has performance issues on some platforms.
Specifically, keyboard responsiveness may be significantly
degraded on OS X.

This package reduces the amount of work done by flyspell.  Instead
of checking *instantly* as you type, spelling will be checked when
the current buffer has been idle for a short time.  (Vanilla
`flyspell-mode' does not use idle timers but a subtle combination
of hooks and `sit-for'.)

This package also turns off `flyspell-mode' completely for certain
buffers.

To use this library, add the following to your ~/.emacs

	(require 'flyspell-lazy)
	(flyspell-lazy-mode 1)

Then use `flyspell-mode' as you normally would.  This package does
not load flyspell for you.

`flyspell-lazy-mode' will invoke spellcheck less frequently than
vanilla `flyspell-mode', though this can be changed somewhat via
`customize'.

==Notes==

`Flyspell-lazy-mode' probably works best if you also set

	(setq flyspell-large-region 1)

If you are using "aspell" instead of "ispell" on the backend,
the following setting may improve performance:

	(add-to-list 'ispell-extra-args "--sug-mode=ultra")
