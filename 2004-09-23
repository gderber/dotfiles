=== Shortcut for editing wiki pages ===

I just noticed a creally handy feature when surfing EmacsWiki: you can edit the text of the page without hitting that link using the mouse:

In Firefox (maybe Mozilla too):

Alt+e takes you directly to edit mode

In Internet Explorer:

Alt+e marks the "Edit text of this page" link so that you only need to press enter.

Does anyone know why this works?

I defined 'e' as a shortcut key.  You can see it in the HTML:

: <a class="edit" '''accesskey="e"''' title="Click to create this page" href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?action=edit;id=SiteMap">Edit text of this page</a>

I think in German it is 'b' (bearbeiten).  For the other languages a translation is missing, I believe.

I also note that the popup text is bogus.  :(

Aaaaah, cool! Then we need 'r' for RecentChanges too... :)
