[http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch GNU Arch] ([::Arch]) is a software version control system that was created by programmer TomLord to meet his version control needs.  It's changeset-oriented, supports distributed development and branching, and has sophisticated merge functionality.

The original implementation of GNU Arch, [::tla], is maintained by AndyTai.  There is also a new, major update to Arch in development: [http://gnuarch.org/revc/index.html version 2.0], [::revc].  A branch of ##tla## called [http://bazaar.canonical.com/ Bazaar] ([::baz], sponsored by Canonical) added new features and performance improvements.  With the 1.3.4 release of Arch, many of the improvements from Bazaar were merged into ##tla##.  (Canonical replaced Bazaar with ##bzr##, also known as BazaarNg, which is nothing like Arch.)

Learn how to use Arch in the [http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/tutorial/arch.html official tutorial].  There's also a [http://web.archive.org/web/20071215105717/http://repose.cx/ArchPrimer.html short intro], as well as guides for different needs at the [http://www.gnuarch.org/gnuarchwiki/ gnuarch-wiki].

vc-arch.el and DistributedVersionControl allow you to use version control with Arch in Emacs.

pcmpl-tla.el by JeremyShaw provides ##tla## command completion for `eshell'.

If anyone knows where to get it, please add that information here.  The archive at http://www.n-heptane.com/{archives}/jeremy@n-heptane.com--2004 doesn't exist anymore.
