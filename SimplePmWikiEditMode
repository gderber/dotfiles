See SimpleWikiEditMode before you read this page.

Based on the file 'simple-emacswiki.el' I (ChristianRidderström) created a file 'simple-pmwiki.el' to allow retrieving and editing files from PmWiki (http://www.pmichaud.com/wiki/PmWiki/PmWiki).

I haven't programmed Lisp in years, so the code is the way it is :-) Anyway, it worked and since I didn't know where to actually put the file, I simply pasted it below.

Note 1: I rewrote this quite a bit and made it work properly, so don't use the stuff below, use the package from this URL http://www.pmichaud.com/wiki/Cookbook/EmacsPmWikiMode?action=browse instead.

Note 2: Uh.. the stuff below looks awful, to get the file content, edit this page and copy the source from there.

;;; Commentary:

;; This file is based on simple-emacswiki.el, modified for PmWiki
;; Use `pmwiki-wiki-browse' to download a page from the PmWiki Wiki.
;; 
;; Usage:
;; 
;; The simplest way to use this is to do the following:
;; 1. Add the directory (http-emacs) where this file is stored to
;;    the load-path of Emacs, e.g add the text.
;; 
;;	(add-to-list 'load-path "~/public_html/Public/emacs/http-emacs")
;; 
;;    to the file .emacs. Then restart emacs.
;; 
;; 2. Use the command 'load-file' to load this file, i.e. simple-pmwiki.el
;; 
;; 3. Now you can use the command 'pmwiki-wiki-browse' to open for
;;    instance the page 'Main/WikiSandbox' from within Emacs. After
;;    you have made some changes, you can use the keyboard shortcut C-c C-c
;;    to save it back to http://www.pmichaud.com/wiki/Main/WikiSandbox
;; 
;; Enjoy. /Christian
