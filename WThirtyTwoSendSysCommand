= WThirtyTwoSendSysCommand =

One way that you can interact with Windows is to send it commands via `w32-send-sys-command'.  These can be bound to a key with an anonymous function or a named function.  Examples of both are given.

[:anonymous]
== Anonymous Functions ==

 (global-set-key [(f4)] (function (lambda () "Maximize frame" (interactive) (w32-send-sys-command 61488))))

[:named]
== Named Functions ==

 (defun my-maximize-frame ()
  "Maximize frame"
  (interactive)
  (w32-send-sys-command 61488))
 
 (global-set-key [(f4)] 'my-maximize-frame)
