I think [[register]]s are not easy to use.
I HATE register commands' key binding.

These commands enable us to store [[region]] into registers easily.

Typing M-w M-w does `copy-to-register'.
Typing C-w C-w kills region and store it into a register.

<pre>
;;;; [2006/02/10] kill-ring / register
(defun kill-ring-save-x (s e)
  (interactive "r")
  (if (eq last-command 'kill-ring-save-x)
      (call-interactively 'copy-to-register)
    (call-interactively 'kill-ring-save)))

(define-key esc-map "w" 'kill-ring-save-x)

;;;; [2006/02/25] kill-region / register
(defun kill-region-x (s e)
 (interactive "r")
  (if (eq last-command 'kill-region)    ;kill-region-x ? 
      (call-interactively 'my-kill-ring-to-register)
    (call-interactively 'kill-region)))
(defun my-kill-ring-to-register (register)
  (interactive "cCopy to register: ")
  (set-register register (car kill-ring)))

(define-key global-map "\C-w" 'kill-region-x)
