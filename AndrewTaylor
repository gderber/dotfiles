Hi all.  Just a random Emacs user.  Nothing to see here, move along...

Hi and welcome!  As to posting patches, the wiki is of course one
possible way to do this.  Since your patch to decipher.el looks really
nice, perhaps you should mail it to the maintainer, or post it to
nntp://gnu.emacs.sources -- or mailto:emacs-devel.gnu.org --

Thanks for the suggestions Alex!  I've posted to gnu.emacs.sources and mailed the maintainer (although it bounced).  So far no feedback and it doesn't appear to have made it into CVS :(
