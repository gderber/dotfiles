Ledger is a command-line accounting tool by JohnWiegley, it provides a double-entry accounting ledger.  The input file is a very simple text file.

You can get it from here: https://github.com/ledger/ledger-mode

Ledger comes with a ledger-mode and a function to add new entries.
Here is an alternate entry function.
The accounts are in German.  All accounts for my expenses start with
"Ausgaben:".  All accounts for my capital start with "Vermögen:" (basically
I can take money from my cash reserves, or from one of my bank accounts).

    (defun ledger-add-entry (title in amount out)
      (interactive
       (let ((accounts (mapcar 'list (ledger-accounts))))
         (list (read-string "Entry: " (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d " (current-time)))
               (let ((completion-regexp-list "^Ausgaben:"))
                 (completing-read "What did you pay for? " accounts))
               (read-string "How much did you pay? " "CHF ")
               (let ((completion-regexp-list "^Vermögen:"))
                 (completing-read "Where did the money come from? " accounts)))))
      (insert title)
      (newline)
      (indent-to 4)
      (insert in "  " amount)
      (newline)
      (indent-to 4)
      (insert out))
