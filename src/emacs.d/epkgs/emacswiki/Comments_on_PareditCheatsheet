I've created a scalable version of this png using LaTeX here: https://github.com/joelittlejohn/paredit-cheatsheet.

There's a PDF available for download and you could easily fork and make changes to the cheatsheet if required.

I've also created a PDF version, and updated the cheat sheet just a tad (corrected some examples, added a couple).  Mine is here: http://pub.gajendra.net/src/paredit-refcard.pdf

Joe, we should collaborate on merging our changes together.
