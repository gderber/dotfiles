My name is Ole Arndt and I use Emacs. Since I now maintain my website with EmacsWikiMode, it's about time to join the EmacsWiki.

You find my homepage at http://sugarshark.com
Sugarshark is the handle I usually use, in games and on IRC. 

Things you find at my site:

* My emacs init files.
* Startings of a Journal (maintained by a hacked version of Gary V. Vaughan's emacs-wiki-journal.el)
* My resume.
* And, well hidden, my email address: (apply #'concat (nreverse (mapcar #'symbol-name '(.com sugarshark @ ole))))

Packages I use:

..for Java Programming, my day work:

* JavaDevelopmentEnvironment
* EmacsCodeBrowser
* EdiffMode
* RefactoringBrowser

...for communication

* CategoryGnus
* EmacsIRCClient (with BitlBee)

..for fun

* [[Mingus]]
* Slime
* many more

: Welcome on the Wiki ! :)

: SachaChua here. Hey, you keep a journal on your site too. I use PlannerMode and remember.el to produce my journal at http://sacha.free.net.ph with a few keystrokes. It even does RSS feeds. Want to try it out? =)

: I'm already using PlannerMode, sometimes. I got a copy of your EmacsWikiMode arch archive and will look into the new possibilities. As it is now, it is a little too public for me. I don't want to show people my tasklist. If there was a way to seperate private and public entries it would be perfect. -- OleArndt
