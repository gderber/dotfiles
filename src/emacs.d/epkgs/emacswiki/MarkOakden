http://www.oakden.org/mark has more detail about me than ANYONE would 
really want to know.

I have written an emacs mode for communicating with internet chess
servers (based on comint and code nicked (with attribution!!) from Gnus).
It is described on the ChessMode page.  I can be found on the FICS and
ICC servers logged in as Sheridan.

I also play at coding in Tcl (which also has a Wiki at http://mini.net/tcl/ )

For a little bit of Emacs/Tcl crossover, see this page (http://mini.net/tcl/EmacsOutlook) at the Tcler's Wiki.  A couple of short Tcl scripts and a bit of Elisp and it is possible to use NTEmacs to edit email messages/replies etc. from Microsoft Outlook!
