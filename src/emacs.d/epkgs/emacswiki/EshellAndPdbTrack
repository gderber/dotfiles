PdbTrack has some dependencies on the standard comint mode. This should help:


<em>Hi Ken, I just made pdbtrack work with eshell. Not sure how to do it cleanly, but here it is in case you want to roll in. I'll post on emacswiki too. Thanks!</em>

 (add-hook 'eshell-output-filter-functions
	  '(lambda () "" 
	     (when (eshell-interactive-process)
	       (pdbtrack-track-stack-file 
		(buffer-substring (eshell-beginning-of-output) eshell-last-output-end)))))

<em>and in pdbtrack-track-stack-file:</em>

 ;eshell support 
 ;             (procmark (process-mark currproc))
 ;             (block (buffer-substring (max comint-last-input-end
              (procmark eshell-last-output-end)
              (block (buffer-substring (max eshell-last-input-end

Also, add a 

 (when eshell-interactive-process
 )

around pdbtrack-track-stack-file to make it work with ange-ftp.
