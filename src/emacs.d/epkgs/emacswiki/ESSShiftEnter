The following lines in my [[init file]] allow me to do three things with just one [[key binding]]:

* if R if not running, it starts automatically and opens an inferior frame

* if the [[region]] is active, evaluates the region

* otherwise, it runs the current line

This is quite useful, saving keystrokes, especially starting R.

Rather than looking for a buffer named "%%*R*%%", it might be more robust to test for major-modes and look for `inferior-ess-process'. With the obvious disadvantage that it gets confusing if ESS is running different processes.


  (defun my-ess-start-R ()
    (interactive)
    (or (assq 'inferior-ess-mode
              (mapcar 
                (lambda (buff) (list (buffer-local-value 'major-mode buff)))
                (buffer-list)))
     (progn
       (delete-other-windows)
       (setq w1 (selected-window))
       (setq w1name (buffer-name))
       (setq w2 (split-window w1 nil t))
       (R)
       (set-window-buffer w2 "*R*")
       (set-window-buffer w1 w1name))))

Exactly the same functionality is available on `C-RET' (`ess-eval-region-or-line-and-step') in ESS v.12.09 and higher.
