Using Emacs since 1996.

<pre>
;; I map the useless caps lock key to SUPER.  Key chords with
;; SUPER+right hand key become very comfortable and should be used for
;; the most often used functions.  This allows me to leave all
;; standard Emacs keybindings as they are and still define
;; easy-to-reach chords with a more sensible geometric layout, for
;; example the following point movement commands:
(global-set-key [(super i)] 'previous-line) 
(global-set-key [(super u)] 'next-line)
(global-set-key [(super shift i)] 'scroll-down)
(global-set-key [(super shift u)] 'scroll-up)
(global-set-key [(super j)] 'backward-char)
(global-set-key [(super k)] 'forward-char)
(global-set-key [(super shift j)] 'backward-word)
(global-set-key [(super shift k)] 'forward-word)
;; Sometimes, it seems reasonable to duplicate standard Emacs CTRL key
;; bindings with SUPER as the modifier:
(global-set-key [(super ?\s)] 'set-mark-command)
(global-set-key [(super a)] 'move-beginning-of-line)
(global-set-key [(super e)] 'move-end-of-line)

At work, I have to use Windows. [[EmacsW32]] makes life easier. To remap the caps lock key to super (or what is called the "Application" key in Windows terminology) I use the following registry entry:

<pre>
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,5d,e0,3a,00,00,00,00,00
</pre>
