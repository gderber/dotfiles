You can find more about Jamie at 
http://www.jwz.org/ and http://www.dnalounge.com/.  You'll almost never see his name "Jamie Zawinski".  If you really want to search on information for him, always use "jwz".  He's one of the few people who can legitimately exist on the net with just his initials.  His LiveJournal weblog is at http://www.livejournal.com/~jwz/.

JWZ was the original maintainer of Lucid Emacs which was supposed to
become GNU Emacs 19, but instead became XEmacs.  He was also part of
the original Netscape team.  He also maintains the xscreensaver
collection, and wrote many of the screensavers.  He uses XEmacs and has a very fine [http://www.jwz.org/doc/emacs-timeline.html Emacs ASCII Art Timeline] on his website.

He was paid to hack on HemLock, CMU CommonLisp's emacs, whilst still at high school.

Author of neato stuff such as:

* Dali Clock (for X and Palms) - not particularly surreal; very calming morphing timepiece
* BbdbMode - The insidious Big Brother Database
* XKeyCaps - A graphical front-end to xmodmap 
* [http://www.jwz.org/webcollage/ Web Collage] - great idea.
