In computing, a set of equivalence classes of strings can be considered a [::thesaurus] and the members of each equivalence class are [::synonym]s for each other.  See [[WikiPedia:Thesaurus#Computing]].

Generally, a thesaurus is typically used for words and phrases of a NaturalLanguage. For English, the best-known thesaurus is ''Roget's Thesaurus''. Thesauri have long been used by careful writers.  

The following pages provide thesaurus or synonym features:

* [[Synonyms]] -- Library <tt>[[synonyms.el]]</tt>.  Search or browse for synonyms, including with [[regexp]]s and [[Icicles|Icicles completion]]. Substitute any thesaurus (in the accepted format), including one you create.
* [[Icicles]] -- Complete a partial word to a word or phrase in a thesaurus.  Uses <tt>[[synonyms.el]]</tt>.
* Library <tt>[[mthesaur.el]]</tt> -- Search for synonyms.
* Library <tt>[http://williamxu.net9.org/ref/wordnet.el wordnet.el]</tt> -- Browse the Word-Net dictionary (''currently broken'')
* [[ShawnBoyette|Wroget]] -- Digital version of ''Roget's Thesaurus''
* [[https://github.com/rootzlevel/synosaurus|Synosaurus]] -- An extensible thesaurus with openthesaurus and wordnet backends. Supports lookup and substitution.
* Library <tt>[[thesaurus.el]]</tt>  -- Look up synonyms on [[http://BigHugeLabs.com|BigHugeLabs.com]], and maybe replace word-at-point.  Animation example:
