Hi, I'm [::dim], an Emacs user, and I seldom contribute to it:

* See ClusterSSH
* Lisp:dim-google.el
* [http://github.com/dimitri/el-get El-Get] to allow for an easy installation, updating and initializing (.emacs) of external emacs modules.
* [http://github.com/dimitri/switch-window switch-window] is a *visual* ##C-x o##

I also maintain a !PostgreSQL oriented blog at http://blog.tapoueh.org/, which is entirely edited with EmacsMuse.

Hi Dimitri, possible FAQs re el-get:
* Are there hooks for overriding el-get's way of dealing with each recipe's configuration of `load-path' and `require'? I need it to fit in with an existing complex .emacs.d setup.
** You can override :features to nil, at least, per package... the use case isn't part of the current design, sorry
* Does the darwin-specific functionality always assume the existence of /Applications/Emacs.app? Some use Aquamacs; I use "standard" (X11) emacs from MacPorts under /opt/local/bin. -- PhilHudson
** No longer, it now has `el-get-emacs' which defaults to (concat invocation-directory invocation-name)
