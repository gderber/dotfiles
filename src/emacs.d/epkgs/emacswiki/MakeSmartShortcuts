The MakeSmartShortcuts is an EmacsLisp program to help me manage my smart start-menu shortcuts when working in Windows. The concept is very nice if you are tired of a cluttered start-menu in which you have to mouse around in. This is a new way of cluttering it, a structured way that let you get at what you really want to...

If you are like me, using Windows at work and like keyboard shortcuts for as many things as possible, try it.


The file can be found [Lisp:mss.el here].
