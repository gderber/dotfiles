Hello,

I use Emacs since 1993 or so, mostly under OS/2 and GNU/Linux.

You may be interested in my pages for Emacs under OS/2. (http://home.snafu.de/ohei/emacs/emacs206-os2.html)

I have also written two articles about the same subject in the Voice OS/2 newsletter, part I is at http://www.os2voice.org/VNL/past_issues/VNL0301H/vnewsf.htm and part II http://www.os2voice.org/VNL/past_issues/VNL0401H/vnewsf.htm, also available in german: http://de.os2voice.org/VNL/past_issues_DE/VNL0301H/vnewsf.htm and http://de.os2voice.org/VNL/past_issues_DE/VNL0401H/vnewsf.htm.

I have also written an Emacs major mode for editing user data addition files for the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Please see http://home.snafu.de/ohei/emacs/ for information. It's also described  here: IMDbAddsMode.

That's it already. Thanks for your interest.

BTW, emacswiki is an innovative use of the WWW, isn't it?

: Well, the original Wiki:WikiWikiWeb is considered to be "the original" -- and it is quite old already.  Ward even wrote a book about wikis. -- AlexSchroeder.
