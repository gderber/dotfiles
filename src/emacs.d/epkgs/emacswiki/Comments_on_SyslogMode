Lisp was updated today. Last warning is now gone, the first three are still there.

I get error below when starting. It seems to have something to do with dired plus which I haven't installed. I would like to see it working without the requirement of dired plus - like the 2014 version before.

Symbol's value as variable is void: diredp-file-name
