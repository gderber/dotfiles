This page is for discussing the possible use of IndexingSchemes for EmacsWiki. That is, should we perhaps add one or more automatically generated pages to the wiki that provide various indexes of the (manually created) Emacs-Wiki pages?

Some readers might be interested in which pages are most consulted (or edited?) or cross-linked. Frequent access and number of cross-links can be indicators of interest or even usefulness of a page's info.

Maintainers and others who clean things up and reorg from time to time might also put such index pages to use in their reorgs. They might notice, for instance, that a particular page needs additional cross references to it, that it is being missed by potential readers because of missing cross links.

I'm not suggesting that such measures are ''very'' useful, that they indicate anything very significant, or that they are always accurate in what they do show. Each has its limitations, but I think such indexes could provide additional guides for navigation and reorg. Some of us consult RecentChanges from time to time to check on new stuff; such usage pages could be additional natural starting places for Emacs-Wiki browsing and suggest places for Reworking.

How about a page that summarizes ''usage statistics'' (reader hits; access counts) for the individual Emac-Wiki pages? Such a usage-statistics page could be organized by hit (access) rank. I'm thinking here of measures like HitCounts and VisitorWeight. Perhaps we could also have such a page ''per Category''.

I'm not convinced this would be useful, therefore I won't code something up.
I'd consider it if written as an elegant Oddmuse:Module...

How about a page (an addition or an alternative to previous suggestion) that scores Emacs-Wiki pages by ''cross links'' -- that is, number of other EmacsWiki pages that link to it -- a la Google indexing (high BackLink count -- MostReferencedPages)? -- DrewAdams

As a starting point, the [[Oddmuse:Links Action]] might help.

How about letting readers score pages by their usefulness, and then creating an InterestMap page that ranks pages by user feedback? -- DrewAdams

One part of this would be vandalism -- how do we easily undo fakes?
In general, based on the Discussion of VotingIsEvil, I'm more interested
in /deliberation/.  The form this takes on a wiki is page creation and editing.
For example, create your own list of "Starting Points" or your own version of a "Site Map"
where you highlight what you think are the most useful pages, and invite other
people to join you.

How about an interactive links-graph page like MeatBall:TouchGraph (see also MeatBall:TouchGraphWikiBrowser), which lets you click graph nodes to navigate the Wiki?  For a version that shows inter-site (not intra-site) links in an interesting way, see http://www.kartoo.com. See also Wiki:VisualizeTheWiki. -- DrewAdams

I'd like to see this.  Since I've had bad experience with both SVG and Java at home, however,
I have my doubts.  If anybody codes something up, I'll be interested in checking it out.
