Several questions about EmacsWiki:

* where is the link for "Today" ? I am used to click onto the date link but I no longer see it here.

There is one on the [[News]] page: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs?action=new

When I checked it today, it was not the case, huh ?! --[[XavierMaillard]]

* How do you translate an EmacsWiki page ? I mean, if I want to translate a page into french, how can I be sure it will only be seen in the emacs-fr "namespace" ?

There is no emacs-fr namespace, emacs-fr only changes the "user interface" ie the Edit Text etc...if translating the name of the page into french is not an option you can add
Fr or Français to the name of the page

What about a link asking to translate the page into other language(s) on each page then ?

Something like this:

# we know about a defined number of languages
# a translation link looks like ##[[fr:La Page Française]]##
# if we look at the english copy of that page containing this translation link, a suitable link will be shown in the footer of the page
# for all the missing translation links, we provide a text field where you can type the translated page name
# if the name already exists you are given instructions on how to solve this problem – you can either click a link that will add the missing translation link to the page you just left, or provide an alternate name
# if the name does not exist, the missing translation link is added to the page you just left, and and you end up on the edit page of the new page

What do you think? -- AlexSchroeder

I like the idea as a whole but how will you know which "version" of
the page a reader is currently visiting. How do you know he wants to
read english or french or spanish... ? We should not need to have
emacs-en or emacs-fr but a sole emacs script that, depending on the
HTTP header, redirect to the "translated" wiki page (if it exists) or
to the original page (if not) with a localized warning message indicating that
the page needs help. Also, I'd rather want a sidebar ala MediaWiki
(xhalee will be happy to read this) indicating that the wiki page is
also available in other language. -- XavierMaillard

Note that http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs will determine your preferred language based on HTTP headers and try to use the appropriate settings if possible (ie. you will end up using emacs-fr if you prefer French). ([http://www.emacswiki.org/scripts/emacs source]) -- Alex

I envision using translation software to generate 'stub' pages for each language.  Even the page names could be generated.  Ultimately we would always fix the translation software instead of the output.

Of course any language can be the authoring language, but only one at a time I think.

For instance, if someone authors a page in French, then the English, German, Spanish, etc. titles for those pages will be generated and those DB entries will be filled with machine translated text...

Maybe later, when the software was nearly perfect, the document could be adjusted from any language. -- PatrickAnderson

I do not like an automatic translated text. Choosing the good title is something harder than just translating it "litterally".
