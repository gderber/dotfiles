Outline Wiki is a mode by JorgenSchaefer that extends the usual outline
mode with the ability to link to files like EmacsWikiMode does. Enclosing
a string of text in braces - {like-this} - will turn it into a link to a
file you can hit RET on to follow. Those files can again be in Outline Wiki Mode, of course. Combined with Outline Mode, this
allows for an easy organization of data.

The link syntax also allows for subdirectories - {foo/bar} will link
to the file bar in the foo directory - as well as linking to outline
topics within a file: {foo#bar} will jump to the outline topic
beginning with bar within the file foo.

An example configuration would be:

  (require 'outline-wiki)
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/\\.notes/" . outline-wiki-mode))

This will turn on outline-wiki-mode for all files in any
directory called <code>.notes</code> and its subdirectories.
