Lets compile recognize flex errors and use the flex compiler shell (fcsh) without fcsh being restarted on each recompile.

M-x compile starts a process each time. This can slow down things when you're working with a really large flex project and mxmlc has to load on each compile. I'm impressed with the speed and awesomeness of the Flex Compiler Shell, so I've hacked M-x compile to re-use an existing instance of the Flex Compiler Shell on each recompile.

== FcshMode ==

This is another major mode for fcsh with some interesting features.

* Compiles with a simple key press ("g")
* Support build files

<code>M-x fcsh</code> will create a file named fcsh-build.el where you can set the compiler, flags, target...
