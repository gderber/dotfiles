Yeah, but wait till I've finished the refactoring.
Actually I could do with some advice from a professional programmer. 
Maybe we could have a chat at emacsconf?

Massive page now. Given this is aimed at newbies might be better to just make a screencast? Youtube hosts screencasts less than 15minutes.

Willdo... at some point... some feature are not complete yet though, so probably better to finish them first.
