How to configure [[ELIM]].

== Directories ==

The default situation is that the icons are stored in a sibling directory and the elim-client is stored in the parent directory of the source files.

One way to do it:

{{{
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/elim")
(autoload 'garak "garak" nil t)
}}}

Put the Elisp (elim.el, garak.el, lui.el, incomplete.el) files in ~/elisp/elim.

Put the elim-client file in ~/elisp.

Put the icons directory in ~/elisp; all the images such as away.png etc. are therefore in ~/elisp/icons.

Consider setting some lui settings for spell checking and chat buffer truncation.

{{{
;; truncate long chat buffers,
;; enable spell checking in all lui buffers
;; and use the american dictionary in them
(setq lui-max-buffer-size 30000
      lui-flyspell-p t
      lui-flyspell-alist '(("." "american")))
}}}

If you're not seeing images in the Garak account tree you need to add this code:

{{{
(setq tree-widget-image-enable t)
}}}
