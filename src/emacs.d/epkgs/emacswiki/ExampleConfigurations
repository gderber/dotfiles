[:adding-example-emacs-configuration]
== Adding an example Emacs Configuration ==

When adding a new Emacs configuration to this page, please bear in mind the following:

# Lists are alphabetically sorted by /author/
# List items do *not* end with a period
# Add the config to the appropriate section; if it uses OrgMode to generate the main configuration files, 
then link it in [[#OrgModeConfigs]], otherwise add it to [[#OtherConfigs]]
# Please start the item with the name of the author, to help with the alphabetical ordering
# Please add a brief summary; every Emacs configuration is different, why might someone want to look at this one?
