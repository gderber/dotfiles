An Emacs interface to command line CD players by MattHodges.
Available at https://alioth.debian.org/projects/mph-emacs-pkgs/.

At present, there are interfaces that work with [http://cdcd.undergrid.net/ cdcd], and cda, which is a component of [http://www.ibiblio.org/tkan/xmcd Xmcd].

It should be possible to support other command line CD players without too much effort.

There are two display modes. One where all tracks are displayed:

and one where only the current track is displayed:

http://mph-emacs-pkgs.alioth.debian.org/images/cdi-one-track.png

The variable <code>cdi-display-type</code> controls the display behaviour.
