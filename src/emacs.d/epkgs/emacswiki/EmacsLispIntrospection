Being a Lisp it's possible to discover much about your program dynamically.

EmacsLisp is particularly open to investigation.

== Basics ==

Function objects can be queryed for certain information

* ##(symbol-function 'somefuncname)## => the function object
** when querying function objects mostly you can use a function object or a symbol with a function object attached to it
* ##(help-function-arglist 'somefunc)## => the function arguments, as used by Help
* ##(documentation 'somefunc)## => the function documentation

== Source-file integration ==

* `find-function' finds a function definition and moves to it: ##(find-function 'somefunc)##
* `symbol-file' finds the file a function definition is in: ##(symbol-file 'somefunc)##
