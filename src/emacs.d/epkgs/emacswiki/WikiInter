 wiki-inter.el --- interwikis for wiki.el

This extension to WikiMode allows you to use a prefix notation for a
known number of hosts on the web.  Therefore, instead of having to
type the entire URL to link to a particular page on one of these
sites, you can use the shorthand notation HOST:PAGE.

* Lisp:wiki-inter.el

If you want to add another host to the list list of recognized hosts,
customize `wiki-inter-links'.

Note that in order to publish, `wiki-inter-link-publish' must be on
`wiki-pub-rules'.  Loading the file puts it there, but if you
customized the rules or set them manually, you will have to add
`wiki-inter-link-publish' to `wiki-pub-rules' yourself.  See
SampleWikiModeSetup for an example.

----

The simplest way to install it is adding (require 'wiki-inter) after
(require 'wiki).
