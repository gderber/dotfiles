Using Gnu emacs since 1996.  I have hacked perl, C++ and Common Lisp for food. 

In 2003 I started a doctoral program in Communication (http://communication.ucsd.edu) and Science Studies (http://sciencestudies.ucsd.edu) at the university of california, san diego.  I want to develop a peer to peer tool for the exchange of arguments and positions between social theorists using DistributedEmacsLisp.  I think disciplinary boundaries suck.

I kept a blog last summer about social theory.  http://signprocess.blogspot.com

: Welcome to the wiki!  As for p2p tool...  did you look at the stuff people have been writing on Meatball?  MeatBall:DebateTool, MeatBall:DoubleWiki, MeatBall:PropositionNet, and of course just plain wikis in the first place.  -- AlexSchroeder
