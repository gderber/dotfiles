The text "beamed" to outlook is quoted-printable when I use Umlauts. I added the main part of "fiddle-quoted-printable" from http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MarioStortiEmacsConfigFile after

  (defun fiddle-quoted-printable ()
  (interactive)
  (progn
    ;; hexl doesn't `provide', grrr!
    (or (fboundp 'hexl-hex-string-to-integer)
	(load "hexl")
	)
    (while (re-search-forward "=\\([0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]\\)" nil t)
      (replace-match (char-to-string
		      (hexl-hex-string-to-integer
		       (buffer-substring
			(match-beginning 1) (match-end 1))))))
    (goto-char (point-min-marker))
    
    ))

  ;;; .... in message-send-mail-with-outlook
    (delete-region (point-min) (progn (search-forward "--text follows this line--")))
    (fiddle-quoted-printable)
