atom-blogger is a  small Emacs module to enable the creation and
editting of blogger.com posts using ATOM.
The package uses the command-line utility curl to provide http
services, and relies on nxml-mode (xml-mode if nxml is not
installed) 
to help edit posts.

I wrote this package as  a light-weight means for posting
to blogger.com Atom
from Emacs.

== Hosting ==

The package is presently
[http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/emacspeak/atom-blogger.tar.bz2 part of the EmacSpeak project on SourceForge].
Note that  the location is incidental, and that the package 
can be used independent  of EmacSpeak.

If someone could load the above tarball to the EmacsWiki's
download area I'd appreciate it.

Please also make the tarball contain a directory -JoelAdamson

I don't think this is going to happen. I suggest somebody who is interested in this set up a GNU Savannah  or SourceForge account and host it there. -- AlexSchroeder
