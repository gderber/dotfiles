The Windows "language bar" has some global keyboard shortcuts that enable changing the active keyboard language. These shortcuts can conflict with some Emacs key combinations, in particular, <code>C-S-)</code> (but <code>C-S-(</code> works!), as used by ParEdit.

Windows 8: To disable these shortcuts, open the Control Panel, choose Language, find the Advanced Settings link on the left, click "Change language bar hot keys" and disable all shortcuts.
