I use emacs as development environment and hence I want to get from emacs as much as possible. But sometimes emacs can't provide some needful feature. So, I want to help other developers to make their life easier with emacs.

[http://eac.sourceforge.net EAC] - Emacs auto-complete project, that can help developers with intellectual dynamic code auto-completing. If you want to help us and join to this project, just mail me. (my e-mail address can be found on eac main page.).
