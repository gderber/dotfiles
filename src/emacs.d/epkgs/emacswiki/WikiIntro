== Wikis, In General ==

* You can also read more about it on [[Oddmuse:What Is A Wiki]].
* Community:WhyWikiWorks explains why wikis (hopefully) generate
interesting content and why there is not much abuse.
* Oddmuse:SiteMap is the homepage of the wiki engine -- the software
that produces the pages you are reading.
* See TextFormattingRules for the basic formatting rules you need.
