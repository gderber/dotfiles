This page is about library '''<tt>[[crosshairs.el]]</tt>''', which combines the features of libraries <tt>[[col-highlight.el]]</tt> (HighlightCurrentColumn) and <tt>[[hl-line+.el]]</tt> (HighlightCurrentLine). This highlights the current line and the current column at the same time, letting you easily locate the [[cursor]].

Here's a screenshot, to show the effect:

Library '''##crosshairs.el##''' provides these commands:

* `toggle-crosshairs-when-idle' -- Highlight the current line and column whenever Emacs is idle more than a certain number of seconds.

* `crosshairs-mode' -- Continually highlight the current line and column, tracking the cursor as it moves. If you bind this to a key, you can also use it to briefly show the current line and column, by hitting the key twice.

* `flash-crosshairs' -- Highlight the current line and column for a few seconds. Another way to show the current line and column temporarily. You can show each for different lengths of time: line and column.
