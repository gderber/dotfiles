Hello.  I'm Jeremy Hankins (aka nowan).

I love emacs for its lispiness and extensibility, but I very much prefer vi for editing.  Fortunately I can run vi under emacs and have the best of both: ViperMode.

I also use Gnus (CategoryGnus), Muse (EmacsMuse), and lots of other miscellany.

I also use sawfish, and in order to get sawfish and emacs to work together better I wrote SawClient.
