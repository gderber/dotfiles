== Introduction ==

A simple interface to weblog servers which present the REST Atom API. 

* http://launchpad.net/atompub.el

== Features ==

Supports editing raw entries with nxml-mode, or EmacsMuse for creating new entries. Since it is not currently possible to transform XHTML into Muse text, it is not currently possible to edit already created entries as Muse entries.

== Compatibility ==

Currently works with [http://blogger.com blogger] and with [http://livedoor.com livedoor].

Supports any authentication present in URL, as well as WSSE authentication.

Should be as international as Emacs. Known to support English and Japanese; author has posted entries in Russian, Hebrew, and Greek, copied from emacs HELLO text.

Works on GNU Emacs 21 & 22(CVS).

== Getting ==

== Helping out ==

=== Supplementary packages ===

* [http://purl.org/net/emacs-atom-api/url.tar.gz URL package known to work]

Feedback is highly encouraged.

Oh, and please note that this is even more unstable than the Atom API spec, whose very name changed as the author was writing the elisp.
