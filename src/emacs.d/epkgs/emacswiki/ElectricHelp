You might prefer to use electric help instead of help, via:

    M-x load-library ehelp

    (global-set-key "\C-h" 'ehelp-command)

Electric help mode does the following.

# It will automatically switch to the help buffer when called, saving you from pressing `C-x o'.
# Will shrink the window to fit the contents of the help buffer.
# Displays key binding information about using the mode in the EchoArea.
# Upon quit returns the window configuration to the way it was.  Regular HelpMode has the habit of changing the window configuration, even after quitting help.

== Stuck in Electric help? ==

If you use electric help often, you will find that Emacs often gets
'stuck' in Electric Help.  viz. you keep seeing the message: "##Press
Space to bury the help buffer, Press R to retain it >>>##" or "##Press
h for help ...##" in the echo area, long after the electric buffer is dead.

To get rid of this, simply invoke electric help again, say by
`C-h f endp' and press `r' to retain the buffer.
