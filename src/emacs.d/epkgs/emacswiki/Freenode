= Freenode =

Freenode is an IRC network run by Peer-Directed Projects Center 
http://freenode.net/pdpc.shtml it is currently the "''official''"
home of #emacs and a few related channels (as well as many others,
but those are the ones we're conerned about here)

== Services ==

IRC usually has related ''services'' which handle things like 
registering as an identified user, managing channel access, 
listing channels and so forth. 

The freenode services are:

* nickserv

* chanserv

* alis

* memoserv

=== nickserv ===

==== REGISTER ====

* %%/msg%% nickserv REGISTER ''<password>'' ''<email address>''

You must then respond the email you receive within 24 hours to confirm
your registration

----

==== IDENTIFY ====

To identify with your normal nick, after connecting with it:

* %%/msg%% nickserv IDENTIFY ''<password>''

To identify with after logging in with an unregistered nick:

* %%/msg%% nickserv IDENTIFY ''<registered-nick>'' ''<password>''

----

==== GROUP ====

To register an alternate nickname with your main account, either:

* identify with the new (unregistered) nick as above

* identify with your regular nick and then change to the new one with ''/nick''

Then:

* %%/msg%% nickserv GROUP

Your secondary nickname now shares account details and a password with the
main one.

----

=== SET ===

Set a flag or switch on your account, see

* %%/msg%% nickserv HELP SET 


==== SET PROPERTY ====

Store some arbitrary info about your account:

* %%/msg%% nickserv SET PROPERTY ''<variable-name>'' ''<value>''

* %%/msg%% nickserv SET PROPERTY ''<variable-name>'' 

As far as I can tell, property names don't have any specific meaning attached,
so you can set what you like.

----

=== GHOST ===

Disconnect old (dead) sessions of yours that haven't gone away:

* %%/msg%% nickserv GHOST ''<nick>'' ''<password>''

or, if you are already logged in and identified with an alternate nick:

* %%/msg%% nickserv GHOST ''<nick>''

----
