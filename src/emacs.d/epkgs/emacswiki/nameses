Nameses enables named desktop sessions for emacs, and is based on [http://scottfrazersblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/emacs-named-desktop-sessions.html my-desktop].
The idea is that your desktop sessions are not associated with directories, but that you can simply switch between sessions such as "latex", "letters", "my-secret-project" etcetera.

== Why nameses? ==
Since I started using [[EmacsAsDaemon|emacs as a daemon]], it became more important for me to be able to switch between desktop sessions, because you typically have only one instance of emacs running. The package [http://scottfrazersblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/emacs-named-desktop-sessions.html my-desktop] proved useful for that, but did not completely fit my needs. Therefore I started this attempt at my first elisp package. These are some of the changes with regards to my-desktop:
* Once your session has a name, it is automatically saved when you exit emacs or switch to a different session.
* Added ido support for choosing sessions
* Desktop sessions are locked when in use
* You can remove sessions, with some checking to prevent removing other files
* You can easily switch to the previous session
* Nameses is compatible with lazy loading of the desktop

In summary, the differences (that can be advantages and disadvantages depending on your habits) with most other session management options would be:
==== Differences ====
* Nameses is short and simple compared to things like [[BookmarkPlus#DesktopBookmarks|desktop bookmarks]]. It does not offer any functionality besides session management.
* Loading an existing desktop is simple: just select one from a list. The difference with most other solutions is that your desktops, once loaded, are automatically saved.
* Nameses takes care of lazy loading of the desktop (so that you do not overwrite a session with a version that is not completely loaded).
* Desktop sessions are stored in one separate directory. Some other ways of using desktop sessions probably lead to problems when you use emacs as a daemon (e.g. [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DeskTop#toc3|here]]).

Overall, the functionality is very simple, so you could easily integrate it into some other module if you would want that. My goal was just to have a simple solution just for session management.

== Usage examples ==
I would recommend putting something like this in your .emacs:

  (require 'desktop)
  (require 'nameses)
  (require 'ido) or (setq nameses-ido-mode nil)
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f9>")     'nameses-load)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-<f9>")   'nameses-prev)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-<f9>") 'nameses-save)

Typical usage would then be:
* <f9> -> Load an existing session
* Ctrl-u <f9> -> Create new session (you'll be asked for a name)
* Ctrl-Shift-<f9> -> Save session (you'll be asked for a name)
* Ctrl-<f9> -> Switch to previous session

Sessions are automatically saved when you leave them, whether you quit emacs or switch to another session. If you mess one up and do not want to save its new state, use
  
  M-x nameses-reset

If you want to remove a session, use

  M-x nameses-remove

Could you please describe how this relates (compares) to simply using multiple Emacs [[DeskTop]]s?  And to using [[BookmarkPlus#DesktopBookmarks|desktop bookmarks]]?

What are the differences, advantages, disadvantages?  Thx - DrewAdams
