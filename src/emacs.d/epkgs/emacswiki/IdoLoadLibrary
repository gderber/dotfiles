==Overview==

Load-library alternative for Emacs using `ido-completing-read'.

==ido-load-library==

Ido-load-library is an alternative to `load-library' which uses
`ido-completing-read' for completion against all available 
libraries in your `load-path'.

The interactive command `ido-load-library' is made available,
though not bound to any key.  It can be executed via

	M-x ido-load-library

or bound via something like

	(define-key global-map (kbd "C-c l") 'ido-load-library)

or safely aliased to load-library

	(defalias 'load-library 'ido-load-library)

==ido-load-library-find==

The interactive command `ido-load-library-find' is also
available.  Like `ido-load-library', it searches your
`load-path', but instead of loading the selected library,
it visits the file in a buffer.

==Bugs==

When invalidating cache, ido-load-library only checks whether
load-path has changed, not whether new files were added to
existing paths.  Workarounds:

	1. Use ELPA/package.el, in which case this assumption always works.
	2. Wait for the cache to expire (7 days).
	3. Give universal prefix argument to `ido-load-library'
           to force invalidation of the cache.
