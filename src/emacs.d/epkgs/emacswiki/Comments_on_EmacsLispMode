Instead of
{{{
;; Recompile if .elc exists.
                (add-hook (make-local-variable 'after-save-hook)
                          (lambda ()
                            (byte-force-recompile default-directory)))
}}}
why not only do what's necessary?
{{{
;; Recompile if .elc exists.
                (add-hook (make-local-variable 'after-save-hook)
                          (lambda ()
                            (byte-compile-file buffer-file-name)))
}}}

----

As the page says, "recompile on save if the ByteCompilation file *does* exist" [emphasis added].  That's the difference.
