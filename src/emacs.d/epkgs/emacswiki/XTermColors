To get 256 colors for Emacs running inside your xterm (##emacs -nw##), follow these instructions:

# make sure you have the ##ncurses-term## package installed
# place the following in your ##~/.Xdefaults## file: ##XTerm*termName: xterm-256color##
# run the following command from your command line: ##xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults##
# open a new ##xterm## and run ##emacs -nw##

To check how many your terminal is supposed to handle, run ##tput colors## on the command line.

More info available from [[twb]]â€™s [ftp://twb.ath.cx/words/term256.html Terminal Emulator 256 Color Support] page.  //(Dead link, but the one in twb's user page still works.)//
