This .emacs produces an error:

 ...
 (require 'cua-mode)
 (CUA-mode t)
 (require 'iso-transl)
 ...

But this one works fine:

 ...
 (require 'cua-mode)
 (require 'iso-transl)
 (CUA-mode t)
 ...

I don't know the interworkings of those packages, but maybe this info could
save someone else's trouble.
