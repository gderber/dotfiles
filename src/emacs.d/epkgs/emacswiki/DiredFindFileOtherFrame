Here's a small function to open files in new frame from dired. This was requested on the EmacsChannel.

  (defun dired-find-file-other-frame ()
    "In Dired, visit this file or directory in another window."
    (interactive)
    (find-file-other-frame (dired-get-file-for-visit)))

  (eval-after-load "dired"
    '(define-key dired-mode-map "F" 'dired-find-file-other-frame))
