This article describes how to build CarbonEmacsPackage by yourself.


== System Requirements ==

* Mac OS X 10.5.2
* XCode
* relatively "new" TeX distribution in your PATH
** AUCTeX requires dvipng 1.6 or later, tex, gs etc.

* Make sure to check your environment variables.  When LANG is set to something (other than English or C), the makeinfo command partially translate info pages.

== Obtaining the source codes ==

For the release versions, visit http://macwiki.sourceforge.jp/emacs/source/ .

Also, the latest source codes are managed by subversion.

 $ svn checkout http://svn.sourceforge.jp/svnroot/macwiki/zenitani/CarbonEmacs


== Directory layout ==

 $ ls

 GPL
 Makefile
 Resources
 non-GPL

== Building an Intel (or PowerPC) build ==

Try 'make' in the following way.
First, expand the source code and apply various patches to the source tree.

 $ make patch

Next, try compile. It may take long time.

 $ make compile

Prepare a disk image file and then install emacs into it.
If you fail something, unmount the "Emacs" voulme.

 $ make dmg
 $ make install

Compile the various elisp libraries and install them into the "Emacs" disk.
If you like, you can edit the "pkg:" section in the Makefile.

 $ make pkg

Now Emacs.app is in the "Emacs" volume.
You can copy it to your application folder, if you want.

To make the "Emacs" volume fancy, try

 $ make icon

Compress the disk image file and unmount the "Emacs" volume.

 $ make done

Now you will see a new disk image file, whose filename is
CarbonEmacs-powerpc-($date).dmg or CarbonEmacs-i386-($date).dmg.

== Making Universal Binary Package ==

(document forthcoming)

== Redistributing your own package ==

Redistributing your own package is welcome.
Before compiling, you should edit "VERSION" section in the Makefile, the readme file (<nowiki>Resources/ReadMe.txt</nowiki>)
and the contact URLs in carbon-emacs-package.el file.
Of course I am very happy if you feedback your enhancements to [http://groups.google.com/group/carbon-emacs?hl=en Carbon Emacs User Group]
.
