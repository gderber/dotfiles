In a similar vein to <tt>show-paren-mode</tt> (ShowParenMode) <tt>paren-set-mode</tt> allows one to see matching pairs of parentheses. When point is on one of the pair, one of three highlighting options shows the matching parenthesis. To activate it manually:

 M-x paren-set-mode

Which will cycle through the four modes of operation:

   OFF   - turn the feature on,
   blink - annoying, blinking parentheses, 
   paren - nice, neat, highlight of matching parenthesis, and
   sexp  - highlight everything between the parentheses. 

You can set, say, paren style by:

  C-u 2 M-2x paren-set-mode RET

or in a .el as:

  (paren-set-mode 'paren)

The only difficulty arises when you have a sequence such as the following:

  (a)(b)(c)

If point is on the parenthesis before the <tt>a</tt>, the corresponding parenthesis after the <tt>a</tt> highlights. If point is after that close-parenthesis, then the open-parenthesis highlights. However, this also means that point is <em>on</em> the opening parenthesis of the <tt>b</tt> pair, yet the matching close-parenthesis does not highlight - the 'match openening paren' takes precedence, in other words.

Has this been removed from CVS? I can't seem to find it. I used to use flash-paren.el for this 
but it seems that it no longer works under CVS. -- Brad Collins
