A simple text marker functionality that highlights portions of text
can be done with XRefMode.

    (defun textmarker-region (start end)
      (interactive "r")
      (xref-source-region start end)
      (xref-target-region start end))

Optionally, annotations would be nice.
FIXME: add info on how to do that
