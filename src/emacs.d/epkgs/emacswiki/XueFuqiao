It looks like you have a lot of work to do! It may be worth looking at
the clx package for Common Lisp to see if it could be ported to
Elisp. It would be cool to be able to display an X-window in an Emacs
window. One problem with doing this sort of thing properly is that,
unlike most versions of Common Lisp, Elisp isn't (yet?)
multi-threaded. I have a feeling that it would take a lot of work to
convert it. One thing that might be possible is to build a clone of
Elisp on top of Common Lisp I don't know how efficient that would
be. But it would require that all Elisp code works in a
lexical-binding environment. If it could be done you would get
multi-threading for free and such things as the clx library for
manipulating X.

this is actually already possible with an Emacs branch, see EmacsXWidgets
