== Intro ==
Delete Needless Spaces is a minor mode that keep clean our buffers from spaces. It's enabled by default for all new and already cleaned buffers but, if you visit a non-cleaned file, it disables itself.

When this minor mode is enabled (implicitly for cleaned buffers and explicitly on dirty buffers with <code>M-x delete-nl-spaces-mode</code>), before a buffers it's saved to its files this mode:
* deletes initial blank lines;
* changes spaces on tabs or vice versa depending on `indent-tabs-mode';
* deletes the trailing whitespaces and empty last lines;
* deletes also latest blank line if `require-final-newline' is nil;

== Screenshots ==
Using WhiteSpace you can see all silly spaces.
