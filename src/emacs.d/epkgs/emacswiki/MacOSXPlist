== Editing OSX Plist Files ==

To edit OSX binary and xml plist files, use the compressed file framework and the plutil provided with OSX. Emacs provides jka-compr which decompresses a file to stdout for reading, and compresses the data from stdin to write the file back out again.

<pre>
;; Allow editing of binary .plist files.
(add-to-list 'jka-compr-compression-info-list
             ["\\.plist$"
              "converting text XML to binary plist"
              "plutil"
              ("-convert" "binary1" "-o" "-" "-")
              "converting binary plist to text XML"
              "plutil"
              ("-convert" "xml1" "-o" "-" "-")
              nil nil "bplist"])

;;It is necessary to perform an update!

== Use environment.plist For Emacs Environment ==

[http://edward.oconnor.cx/elisp/osx-plist.el osx-plist.el] is an Emacs lisp parser for MacOSX's plist files.

If you'd like Emacs to update its environment based on the contents of ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist, install this library and add the following to your .emacs file:

 (require 'osx-plist)
 (osx-plist-update-environment)

Share and Enjoy!

This file (tagged version 1.0.0 in its source) only parses plist files whose root node is a dict.

If you want to use it to parse plist files whose root node is an array, a quick fix is to replace the defun on line 84:
<pre>
(defun osx-plist-parse-file (file)
  "Parse the plist file FILE into an elisp hash table."
  (let ((xml (car (xml-parse-file file))))
    (when (osx-plist-p xml)
      (osx-plist-node-value (car (xml-get-children xml 'dict))))))
</pre>
with the following
<pre>
(defun osx-plist-parse-file (file)
  "Parse the plist file FILE into an elisp hash table."
  (let ((xml (car (xml-parse-file file))))
    (when (osx-plist-p xml)
      (osx-plist-node-value (car (or (xml-get-children xml 'dict)
				     (xml-get-children xml 'array)))))))
</pre>
