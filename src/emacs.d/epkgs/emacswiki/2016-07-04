[[DrewAdams|Drew Adams]] alerted me to a new wave of spam attacks, reverted them, and locked the wiki.
I'm going to see whether a bunch of new regular expressions added to BannedRegexps will fix the problem. :)

Sadly, the spammers forced me to add a really broad regular expression which ends up making many existing pages
uneditable because they contain false positives.

Assuming that the wiki currently contains no spammed pages, this list is all the false positives:

* [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=list-banned-content List Banned Pages] (/slooooow.../)

If you have an idea to improve the regular expressions in BannedRegexps, leave a comment and let me know.
