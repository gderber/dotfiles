[[https://github.com/swank-js/swank-js|SwankJs]] is a full-blown SlimeMode backend for [[NodeJs|node.js]] and can connect to a running web browser process through the socket.io package. 

== installation ==
There's a list of instructions on [[https://github.com/swank-js/swank-js|SwankJs's github page]]. At times they seem verbose, at other times, too terse.
Also relies on symlinks, so installation for Windows environments may be funky.
There's a different installation page @ https://github.com/swank-js/swank-js/wiki/Installation

The [[http://wikemacs.org/index.php/Swank-js|wikemacs page]] notes that "Installation is complicated and requires Node.JS, SLIME, js2-mode. On Ubuntu/Debian the nodejs-legacy package might be required." Charming.
