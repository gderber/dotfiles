df-mode.el is a small minor mode that show the space left on devices. It is based on df.el.

Download: Lisp:df-mode.el

== Configuration ==

Put df-mode.el in your <code>load-path</code> and this in your .emacs file:

 (autoload 'df-mode "df-mode" nil t)
 (df-mode 1)

== Bugfix ==

The currently available version of df-mode.el seems to need this additional custom variable definition.

 (defcustom directory-free-space-program "df"
   "*Name of your df(1) program."
   :type 'string
   :group 'df)

Perhaps it is normally defined elsewhere, but I don't have that code loaded?  (Using Debian's GNU emacs 21.4.1)

The left number are the size of the current file and the right number are the size of the using device.
