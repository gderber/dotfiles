I'm Dan Leslie.

Personal page is hosted (occasionally) at [http://ironoxide.ca Iron Oxide].

I'm on [http://twitter.com/dleslie Twitter], [http://github.com/dleslie/ Github], [http://careers.stackoverflow.com/dleslie Stack Overflow] and [http://www.google.com/profiles/dleslie Google].

I've been using the username [[dleslie]] since the late 80s and started programming in Lisp at about the same time. This led me on the path to pursuing computing science as both a study and a life style, leading me through academia, gaming, start ups, hobbies and happiness.

Sadly, I've only recently begun contributing to Emacs:
