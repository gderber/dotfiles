Hi, I use GNU Emacs under Windoze:-$.

You can find my homepage at URL:liyu2000 DOT nease DOT net. There is a Emacs page at URL:liyu2000 DOT nease DOT net/webpage/Emacs.html(Alert! in Chinese) contains my dot files and other things..

I also maintains some Chinese introduction pages of EmacsWikiMode at URL:liyu2000 DOT nease DOT net/webpage/EmacsWikiZh.html.

At last, I have to say: nease DOT net is bad guy, but I am not.:-<

Welcome to the wiki.  Maybe you can add some more Chinese content to the wiki.
Certainly Chinese spam is giving China a bad name in the wiki world these days.
That is very unfortunate.  -- AlexSchroeder
