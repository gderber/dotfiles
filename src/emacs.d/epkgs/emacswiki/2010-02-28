The [[Git repository]] is now available. It is an import of the SVN repository
but also features branches that contain only reasonable subsets of all files, like
e.g. just webpages or just Emacs lisp files.

The [[Git repository]] is part of the [[Emacsmirror]] which now contains repositories
for most packages distributed on the EmacsWiki.  These repositories contain as much
of the package's history as available in the SVN repository though the commit
messages are just timestamps.
