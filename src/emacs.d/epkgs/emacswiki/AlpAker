The following packages all concern, in one way or another, usability and human interface issues.

* [[FrameBufs]] is intended as a convenience for those who like to organize their workflow in Emacs by using specific frames for different projects. It extends Emacsâ€™s buffer menu so that it understands a distinction between those buffers that are associated with a given frame and those that are not. The buffer menu can be toggled between a list of all buffers and a list of only those buffers associated with the selected frame. The criteria governing which buffers are associated with a frame can be customized through various options.  In addition, buffers can be manually added to and removed from the list of buffers associated with a frame. The package interacts properly with ##other-buffer## and respects changes in buffer ordering made by ##bury-buffer##. 

* [[PerWindowPoint]] changes how Emacs selects point when displaying a buffer in a window.  While it is enabled, each window keeps a record of the last value of point in every buffer that has been displayed in it.  When a window is switched back to a buffer it has displayed before, point and window-start are reset to the values they had when that buffer was last displayed in that window.  NOTE:  This package is obsolete as of v24; the built-in option ##switch-to-buffer-preserve-window-point## provides the same functionality.

* [[FillColumnIndicator]] is a minor mode that indicates the location of the fill column, either by shading the area of the window to the right of the fill column or by drawing a thin line down the editing window at the location of the fill column.

A few people have asked (apropos of the screenshots on the FillColumnIndicator page) what my font-lock settings are.  The basic scheme is:

<pre>

(let ((faces '((font-lock-comment-face :foreground "#4d7a70" :slant italic)
               (font-lock-constant-face :foreground "#6b7875")
               (font-lock-string-face :foreground "#7a633d")
               (font-lock-type-face :foreground "grey50")
               (font-lock-warning-face :foreground "#cd5c5c")
               (font-lock-preprocessor-face :foreground "#596766" :weight bold)
               (font-lock-doc-face :foreground "#707f75" :slant italic)
               (font-lock-keyword-face :foreground "#665d9c" :weight bold)
               (font-lock-builtin-face :foreground "gray50" :weight bold)
               (font-lock-function-name-face :foreground "#2e5fa2" :weight bold)
               (font-lock-variable-name-face :foreground "#6f5057" :weight bold)
               (mode-line  :background "#bedefe" :box (:line-width 2 :color "gray85")))))
  (dolist (face faces)
    (apply 'set-face-attribute (car face) nil (cdr face))))

</pre>
