=General=
When typing 't m' (cal-tex-cursor-month) on the current month in CalendarMode you will be presented a new buffer named 'calendar.tex' containing a latex representation of the current month.

Save it. Then, typing '\C-c\C-c' and <Enter> (likely selecting tex-compile), will "compile" the file and then you can see it by typing "\C-c\C-c" and <Enter> again (likely selecting \doc-view "calendar.pdf").

Note that typing 't M' instead of 't m' will change the orientation of the calendar.

You can also print the file with '\C-c\C-p'.

=Printing to A4 pages=
If you print A4 pages, the calendars are probably too wide for you.  I often print monthly calendars.  The default setup prints them 18cm wide; I want them 17cm wide.  Here's how to do it:

 (add-hook 'cal-tex-hook 'my-calendar-a4)

 (defun my-calendar-a4 ()
   "Replace all occurences of 18cm with 17cm."
   (goto-char (point-min))
   (while (search-forward "18cm" nil t)
     (replace-match  "17cm")))
=Printing a Hipster PDA=
You can generate a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_PDA Hipster PDA] style printout with the data from your diary file. Use the following Makefile to generate a PDF. It requires the pdfjam package which you can find at http://www.warwick.ac.uk/go/pdfjam. Also make sure you set cal-tex-diary to true so that diary entries show up in the calendar.

The Makefile is now maintained within the CONTRIB directory of [http://www.orgmode.org org-mode]. The latest version can be fetched from https://github.com/tkf/org-mode/blob/master/contrib/scripts/org2hpda.
