I'm a software engineer that spends most of my day in emacs.  I use it for reading mail, IM, and of course writing code.

I used to contribute to the JDE project.  I currently make minor contributions to the OrgMode project.

I used to work on the [[Google_Wave_for_Emacs]] project, a project to create a client for Google Wave in emacs.  But, Wave got de-prioritized.  I may try to spin the websockets library out of it, though.

Currently I maintain the CodeImports library, which is a package for managing imports in C++ and Java code.
