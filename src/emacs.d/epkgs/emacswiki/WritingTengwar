I'd like to use emacs to write in the various Tolkien languages.

<nowiki>TrueType</nowiki> Tengwar fonts are available, but they have problems. Tolkiens elvish orthographies have the vowels suspended above the consonants. This seems to have been implemented with massive kerning offsets in the <nowiki>TrueType</nowiki>Tengwar fonts I've found. The kerning offsets confuse emacs sorely, and it only draws the vowels on top of the consonants after a C-l (redraw), and any other full screen update.

That makes normal text editing pretty much impossible.

Is there some way to fix this?

: If I understand you correctly -- and unless I am much mistaken --, the only proper way to fix this is to fix the font: implementing combining diacritical characters via offsets in the font does not seem like a sound strategy to me. When you have fixed the font, it should be possible implement the combining characters via compositions.

It still looks great in a screenshot - http://purl.org/net/shapr/emacstengwar.jpg

Since this image turns out to be the most popular thing on my web server, I'll add instructions for making this work in your own emacs.

Once you have xfs-xtt or xfstt installed and server up the truetype tengwar fonts you downloaded from http://www.google.com/search?q=tengwar%20truetype%20font then you execute this elisp that looks something like this:

(make-face 'tengwar-parmaite)
(set-face-font 'tengwar-parmaite "-ttf-tengwar parmaite-medium-r-normal-*-*-260-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1")
(make-face 'tengwar-noldor)
(set-face-font 'tengwar-noldor "-ttf-tengwar noldor-medium-r-normal-*-*-160-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1")
(make-face 'tengwar-quenya)
(set-face-font 'tengwar-quenya "-ttf-tengwar quenya-medium-r-normal-*-*-200-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1")
(make-face 'tengwar-sindarin)
(set-face-font 'tengwar-sindarin "-ttf-tengwar sindarin-medium-r-normal-*-*-160-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1")
(make-face 'tengwar-gandalf)
(set-face-font 'tengwar-gandalf "-ttf-tengwargandalfmedium-medium-r-normal-*-*-160-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1")

You may need to use xfontsel to discover the correct string to describe various tengwar fonts on your system.

Further research: I've found some tengwar TeX fonts, does anyone know if it's possible to use those in emacs?
