Vim (includes vi and ex) can intepret modeline string in the file, which is similar to the Emacs' file local variables.

vim-modeline will parse Vim modeline in the file, and try to interpret in Emacs ways if possible.

== Download ==

Download it from:

    git clone http://github.com/cinsk/emacs-vim-modeline.git

== Install ==

As usual, include ##emacs-vim-modeline/## directory in your load-path, and put following lines in your init file:

    (require 'vim-modeline)
    (add-to-list 'find-file-hook 'vim-modeline/do)

== Discussion ==

It is not mature enough, but still usable. :)
