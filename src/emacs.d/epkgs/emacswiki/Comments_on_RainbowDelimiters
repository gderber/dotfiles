I have sad news, friends. jlr, the maintainer of this package, passed away almost exactly one year ago, and active development has moved from https://github.com/jlr/rainbow-delimiters to https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters

He was an inspiration and teacher to many people, including me. I only wish I could have better appreciated the gems of knowledge that he freely gave to me when I was first starting out.

He was a true modern wizard who never tired of making computers do weird and wonderful things, and he imparted this sense of joy and wonder upon others. Despite all of this this, he was also eternally humble, always spared time to help beginners, and was an essential part of the emacs community. He touched thousands of lives, including mine, through his prodigious digital correspondence, and tens of thousands use his code every day.

I feel such an emptiness now that he is gone, but I take comfort in the fact that his spirit lives on in his code, and in the knowledge and curiosity that he imparted upon us. Development has moved on unceasingly, but I still fire up his old modules sometimes- my own personal tribute to his memory. When I do this, I smile, and remember him, and in my minds eye, I can almost see him laughing back at me.
