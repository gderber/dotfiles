Seems like a useful combination. After running this, you can use `M-,' to step through the matches.

    (defun find-grep-dired-do-search (dir regexp)
      "First perform `find-grep-dired', and wait for it to finish.
    Then, using the same REGEXP as provided to `find-grep-dired',
    perform `dired-do-search' on all files in the *Find* buffer."
      (interactive "DFind-grep (directory): \nsFind-grep (grep regexp): ")
      (find-grep-dired dir regexp)
      (while (get-buffer-process (get-buffer "*Find*"))
        (sit-for 1))
      (with-current-buffer "*Find*"
        (dired-toggle-marks)
        (dired-do-search regexp)))

[new]
So this is roughly equivalent to the key sequence `M-x find-grep-dired REGEXP RET % m RET A M-p RET RET'?
