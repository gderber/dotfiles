Your link to an ErikNaggum USENET flame thread on Google is broken.  While I'm talking to you; the GnuFans dot-net Wiki is broken (submissions don't work)  -- AaronHawley

Thanks for fixing that link. --AaronHawley

How can you be contacted? Your homepage is down and the respective email doesn't work anymore, nor does another email I found in some of your libraries. Are you going to distribute your Emacs libraries again sometime? -- JonasBernoulli

A copy of the email I sent to you:

Hello

I maintain a mirror of Emacs packages at
https://github.com/emacsmirror which includes quite a few of your
packages. This packages are regularly and automatically synchronized
to import newer versions. Recently I noticed that this started failing
and that your homepage at http://www.gnufans.net/~deego is down.
Actually the complete domain is down.

So I was wondering if you are going to put your homepage and
especially the Emacs packages up again there or somewhere else. If
that domain is gone for good and you do not want to setup a new
homepage I would recommend making your packages available on
http://github.com.

If you do that please create one repository per package. I import git
(and other) repositories containing exactly one package or plain files
hosted using http or ftp but I do not import repositories that bundle
together unrelated libraries.

Making your packages available on github might even be a good idea if
you don't personally use git and/or do no longer want to maintain
these packages. It might increase the changes of somebody else
volunteering to do so. If you do go that route and are not comfortable
using git I can help you with the process.

Thanks

JonasBernoulli
