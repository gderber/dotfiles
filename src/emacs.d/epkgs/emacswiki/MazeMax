 mazemax.el --- labyrinth generation and exploration

Once the elisp code is loaded, type M-x mazemax to generate a random maze (and start exploring it).

This package is not part of Emacs.

[new]
Note: as it is, mazemax does not work on XEmacs. To make it work, replace in line 367

  (eq c 32))  

with 

  (eq c ?\ )
[new]
Could someone please upload a version that works both in Emacs and XEmacs...
[new]
: maybe dirty solution is <code>(eq c (if (string-match "XEmacs" emacs-version) ?\  32))</code> ? --ZajcevEvgeny

Shouldn't (eq c ?\ ) work for Emacs, too?  On my system (eq 32 ?\ ) => t, so I think it should work.  Can somebody report this as a bug?  -- AlexSchroeder
[new]
On GNU Emacs ?\  evaluates to 32 itself, probably XEmacs employs a distinct type for characters.  Anyway, I just uploaded a never version of the file, which should solve this problem (though I have tested it just on GNU Emacs yet, and there may be other compatibily problems with the new display code). -- MicheleBini
