<biiter> i spent two weeks with emacs and im only pissed off.. (vim
	 is the same).. i can't work on linux..
<parolang> :(
<parolang> It takes longer than two weeks.
<biiter> i want to programe.. not to fuck with editor..
<parolang> Yes, but with emacs you can do both at the same time :)
<parolang> See, this is the emacs spirit.  You use the editor to edit
	   your editor, it's recursion, and that's why it needed
	   lisp.
<parolang> Even the name, Editing !MACroS.  For what are macros for?
	   For editing.  So you use emacs to edit your macros that
	   help you edit macros.
<parolang> The secret is that there is no point to emacs outside of
	   emacs, that's why emacs users try to do everything inside
	   of emacs, because outside of emacs everything seems
	   meaningless in existential dispair.
<parolang> This is why emacs users bury themselves in parens; for
	   each paren matches another paren, and all the parens
	   cancel each other out.  And there is nothing outside of
	   the parens, for all the parens collapse in on themselves
	   into nil.
