 master.el --- make a buffer the master over another buffer

This minor mode allows you to remote-control one buffer from another buffer.

Use M-x master-mode in the first buffer, then call M-x
master-set-slave and specify the second buffer.  Now you can scroll
the second buffer using `C-c C-p' and `C-c C-n'.

This can be usefull within Emacs if you are writing a SQL statement in
a SQL buffer and send it over to the SQLi buffer.  Instead of
switching windows and scrolling the SQLi buffer, you can now scroll
the SQLi buffer from the SQL buffer: SQL buffer is the master of the
SQLi buffer.

This is the way to install Master mode in conjunction with SqlMode:


     (autoload 'master-mode "master" "Master mode minor mode." t)
     (add-hook 'sql-mode-hook
                (function (lambda ()
                            (master-mode t)
                            (master-set-slave sql-buffer))))
     (add-hook 'sql-set-sqli-hook
                (function (lambda ()
                            (master-set-slave sql-buffer))))
