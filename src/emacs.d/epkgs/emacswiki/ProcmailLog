procmaillog.el read your procmail log file as a gnus group.

First you need procmaillog.el. You can grab it here: Lisp:procmaillog.el

The next step is to set up your .procmailrc. procmaillog.el needs spaces between the procmail log records. So just put this in your .procmailrc:

 LOGFILE=$HOME/.procmaillog
 LOG="
 "

Now you have to set up your Emacs configuration file. Put simple this in it: (Don't forget to put procmaillog.el in your <code>load-path</code>.)

 (require 'procmaillog)

If your LOGFILE different configure the variable <code>procmaillog-file</code>. E.g. in your configuration file:

 (setq procmaillog-file "~/my.procmail.log")

After the next Gnus start create a doc group with <tt>G f</tt> and choose your procmail log file.
Enter the group and enjoy your structured procmail log file. 
(Note: The headers <em>X-Procmail-Folder</em> and <em>X-Procmail-Number</em> should be visible, i.e. put them into gnus-visible-headers.)
