The line of links at the top and at the bottom starting with SiteMap or its equivalent if you're browsing in another language is called the goto bar.  It is a minimal list of important links.  To complement the user with more useful links would be to have a community-editable sidebar page.  See Community:FrontPage for an example.

The current existince and order of the links in the goto bar are based on the following reasons:

* SiteMap and [[Search]] are top-level navigation aids.
* ElispArea, like SiteMap and [[Search]], is a prominent part of the site and getting code is a common task of the site.
* SiteMap, [[Search]], ElispArea, and HowTo are all things that newbies will look for; the rest is more for wiki junkies. 
* [[News]] and RecentChanges should be next to each other.
