Let me introduce myself.  I use GnuEmacs every day since 1995.
[[Gnus]] is my news and mail reader, DiredMode is my file manager.
I am not fluent in EmacsLisp and I did not write any elisp code
(yet) other other than my customization files.  My home page is
http://www.math.unifi.it/~maggesi/.  -- marco maggesi
