I find Emacs to be an extremely useful tool for academic work.   I edit TeX in AUCTeX mode, manage BibTeX files in BibTeX mode, read and write email using WanderLust, print envelopes, etc in Emacs. 

My Emacs Lisp projects:

* [[amazon.el]]

* [[bibsnarf.el]]

* [[env-print.el]]

* [[gradebook.el]]
