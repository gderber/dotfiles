When the manual entry you want to refer to contains a space, you need to use double square brackets:

{{{
* [[Manual:Circular Objects|Circular Stuff]]
* [[Manual:Circular Objects]]
}}}

Result:

* [[Manual:Circular Objects|Circular Stuff]]
* [[Manual:Circular Objects]]

Thanks! Btw we discussed this on #emacs.

jlf said he thought it would be a good idea if the manual links explained how to find that manual in Emacs. Sachac and I suggested it could be done via an intermediary page containing instructions on how to get to the manual on your machine.

So the manual cgi could redirect to the display of a page (an SSI?) containing the instructions and a link to the page. Perhaps the link would autodirect if you had a cookie set.

Anyway, people thought this was quite a good idea but recognized how much dev it was. I said I would consider writing it with ElWiki but that I'd mention it on the existing Wiki.

Hm. I'm not sure. If anybody has an idea of how to do this -- infer the locally installed info file from the URL -- and thinks this is worth it, the Perl 5 [http://www.emacswiki.org/scripts/info-ref source of the little script I'm using is available]. As for myself, I'm not too convinced this is useful information.

I think it's simpler than that. What jlf meant is something like:

"You can get this manual on your computer too, especially if you're running Emacs or the GNU system. Just open the info browser and read! If you're in Emacs press "C-h" and then "i" and the info browser will come up. If you're using the GNU system and don't have Emacs you should at least have the standalone GNU info browser..." blah blah

I suggested a video would be a useful shortcut.

Seems like a feature that would be useful to add upstream in [[Texinfo]]: The generated HTML files could contain information on how to visit the node in [[Info]].
