== Overview ==

*NOTE:* xml-rpc.el is available at: Emacs 24 package manager repository [[ELPA]]/Marmalade

XMLRPC (XML Remote Procedure Calls) is a protocol for remote procedure calling using HTTP as the transport and XML as the encoding. XML-RPC is designed to be as simple as possible, while allowing complex data structures to be transmitted, processed and returned.

The spec can be found at http://www.xmlrpc.com/.

== xml-rpc.el ==

This is an XML-RPC client implementation in elisp, capable of both
synchronous and asynchronous method calls (using the url package's async
retrieval functionality).

XML-RPC is remote procedure calls over HTTP using XML to describe the
function call and return values.

xml-rpc.el represents XML-RPC datatypes as lisp values, automatically
converting to and from the XML datastructures as needed, both for method
parameters and return values, making using XML-RPC methods fairly
transparent to the lisp code.

This is an implementation of XML-RPC in EmacsLisp. It allows Emacs to
make asynchronous remote procedure calls over http.

You can find it on Github:
https://github.com/hexmode/xml-rpc-el

Or install it via [[MELPA]].

It could probably be useful for communicating with EmacsWiki using the
MeatBall:XmlRpcToWiki API.  See the WikiRemote for further discussion
on the topic.  -- DanielLundin

== Older Versions ==

Following are versions that other people have had at one time or
other.  I’ve tried to incorporate them into the Savannah version of
the code.

* http://elisp.info/package/xml-rpc/xml-rpc.el (My old code.  I’ll put a redirect on this soon.)
* http://purl.org/NET/wence/xml-rpc.el.patch (The latest xml-rpc.el (there are several versions floating around on the net, but the above link seems to be the most recent) is broken. A patch that I found here seems to fix it)
* http://blogs.openaether.org/data/weblogger.el-wordpress.patch  
* http://blogs.openaether.org/?p=126 

elisp.info hasn't been updated in almost a year, so I figured this would be a good idea. The versions here work together perfectly for BloggerMode.
