Due to the translation efforts of JoonhwanLee
[http://www.oddmuse.org/cgi-bin/oddmuse/Korean]
the Korean interface to this site should be much improved. :)

To automatically identify Korean pages, I need a list of
10 or 20 very common Korean characters. The rule of thumb
used on this site that I can specify a regular expression
per language. If it matches at least three times, the page
is marked as containing text in that language. (A page can
have multiple languages on it.)

That's great.  Now we can have greater confidence in inviting Korean emacs users.[[[2005-06-30]]]
