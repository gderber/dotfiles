== Mode-Line Position ==

This page describes library <tt>[[modeline-posn.el]]</tt>, which provides extensions to the standard Emacs variable `mode-line-position' for Emacs 22 and later. That variable governs the behavior of minor modes `line-number-mode',  `column-number-mode', and `size-indication-mode', which show/hide the current line number, column number, and buffer size, respectively, in the [[mode line]].

The following extensions are provided by library ##modeline-posn.el##:

'''1.''' Whenever the current column is greater than ‘modelinepos-column-limit’, the column-number indication in the mode-line is highlighted in face `font-lock-function-name-face'. This lets you know when you've gone past a certain number of characters in any line. You can customize user option ‘modelinepos-column-limit’, and you can bind it to different values in different modes. 

'''2.''' In TransientMarkMode, when the [[region]] is [[active region|active]], the size indicated is that of the region, not the [[buffer]].  This portion of the mode-line is then highlighted with face `region'.  ([[option|Option]] '''`modelinepos-empty-region-flag'''' determines whether to also indicate an ''empty'' active region.)

'''3.''' The region highlighting in the mode-line is changed to a different face when you invoke a command that behaves specially for an active region.  Currently, this applies to replacement commands such as `query-replace'.  If you use library '''[[Isearch+]]''' then it also applies to [[Isearch]] and to replacement commands invoked from Isearch. 


'''For #2:''' When the region is active, the mode line displays some
information that you can customize --- see option
'''`modelinepos-style''''.  Customization choices for this include: (a)
the number of chars, (b) the number of bytes, (c) the number of chars and number of lines,
and (d) anything else you might want.  Choice (c) is the default.

For (d), you provide a `format' expression as separate components:
the format string and the sexp arguments to be evaluated and
plugged into the string.  The number of sexp args depends on the
format string that you use: one for each '''`##%##'''' construct.

Choice (d) is provided so that you can choose alternative
formatting styles.  For example, instead of '''`## 256 ch, 13 l##'''', you
could show '''`## (256 chars, 13 lines)##''''.  But (d) can really show
information at all.  It need not have anything to do with the
region, but it is nevertheless shown when the region is active.

Option '''`modelinepos-empty-region-flag'''' determines whether to show
the active-region indication when the active region is empty.  By
default it is `t', meaning indicate an empty active region.

'''For #3''': Certain standard Emacs commands restrict their scope to
the region when it is active.  Some of these are handled here by
highlighting the region indication in the mode line specially
(using face '''`modelinepos-region-acting-on'''' instead of face
'''`modelinepos-region'''').  The region-restricted commands defined in
standard library `##replace.el##' are handled this way.

If you also use library '''[[Isearch+]]''' (<tt>[[isearch+.el]]</tt>) then (for Emacs 24.3+) Isearch commands too can optionally be restricted to the
active region, and they too are handled by the special mode-line
highlighting.  This includes `##M-%##' and `##C-M-%##' during Isearch,
which invoke query-replacement.  Not only is the Isearch region
indicated in the mode line, but the query-replacement command is
invoked from Isearch with that region active, so it too is limited to that scope.

Here are some screenshots to show the effect.

This is really handy. Thanks! One request for enhancement: add a customization variable to allow us to use a face other than `font-lock-function-name-face'.  My modeline is blue and my `font-lock-function-name-face' is also blue, so that particular face isn't a good choice for me. --AmitPatel

Would it be possible to optionally display the absolute value of point even while not in TransientMarkMode? -- [[priyadarshan]]

Sorry, but I think that if you want something like that it should be as an extension of `line-number-mode' and/or `column-number-mode'.  Showing [[point]] as an option makes sense regardless of whether the [[region]] is [[active region|active]].

Of course, as soon as point is shown someone will also want to see [[mark]]...

If you want to do this kind of thing, just take a look at the code in <tt>[[modeline-posn.el]]</tt>, in particular the redefinition of `mode-line-position'.  The parts to tweak are those for `line-number-mode' and `column-number-mode' (one or both, depending on what you want).  HTH -- DrewAdams

Thank you for the pointers! I shall try and let you know. -- [[priyadarshan]]
