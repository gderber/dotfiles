OtherMichael: What would you prefer? Magic?

Something like magic.

A markup-code that aggregates all pages that contain a particular tag, f'r instance.

Something like <nowiki>PmWiki's</nowiki> [http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/PageLists|pagelist] or [http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/Categories|category] markup, I suppose, could be considered indistinguishable from magic.

I was hoping such a markup existed, and I was just incapable of ferreting it out in the docs. :-(
