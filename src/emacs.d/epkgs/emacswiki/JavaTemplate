Jtemplate is a java helper for building classes or interfaces by AlexandreBrillant.

You can get it from here:

* http://www.djefer.com/~jtemplate (Broken link)

This version uses a database with all the JDK 1.4 interfaces. When a
user
wants to implement one or several interfaces, jtemplate searches and
proposes
to user all the needed methods.
