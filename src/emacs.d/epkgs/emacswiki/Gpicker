[[fr:Gpicker_francais]]
gpicker is a solution for quickly choosing a file from a (possibly large) project.

Files are searched by their basename, but patterns containing '/'
automagically turn on matching of the directory name.

It's base filtration is similar to InteractivelyDoThings flex
matching, but it places great emphasis on 'correctly' ordering
matching names. It tries to place matches contiguously and matches on
word beginnings before all other matches. It is also possible to emphasize
the word beginning in a pattern by capitalizing first character (so '!ClLoad'
will score hugely on '!ClassLoader'), or by placing delimiter before
it ('s-w-m' for 'several-words-matching'). See its [http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gpicker.git;a=blob_plain;f=README;hb=HEAD README] for more details and examples. Examples in pictures
can also be seen here

It's implemented as a gtk program (which makes it fast even on large projects) and a few emacs lisp functions to
invoke it.
