Hemlock is an [[extensible]] Emacs-like text editor embedded in CMUCL. It follows the tradition of the Lisp Machine editor [[ZWEI]] and the ITS/TOPS-20 implementation, TecoEmacs. Hemlock is supposed to be able to display to a terminal, or use CLX for X11; afaik only X works at present.

It is part of Debian:

* http://packages.debian.org/stable/devel/cmucl-hemlock.html

In more recent versions of Debian it moved into the cmucl-source
package.

And there is also [[CLiki:Portable Hemlock]], "An attempt to free HemLock from its CmuCl prison."

Some people do seem to be actively hacking on Hemlock -- see
e.g. CLiki:CloserLookAtHemlock.
