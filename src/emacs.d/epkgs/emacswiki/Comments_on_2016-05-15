FWIW, now the links, buttons, and some other text at the bottom of each page seem to be in Italian (?).

And even the Recent Changes page shows Italian (?):

Ultime modifiche, Modifiche negli ultimi 7 giorni, Elenca tutte le modifiche, cronologia, minore, nuovo, etc.

But resetting the cookie seems to take care of it. How/why it got changed, I don't know.

Hm. I'll try and get rid of the nginx cache over the summer. People getting cached pages in the wrong language has been annoying me for too long.

I wonder whether these issues have all been resolved, now? I just fixed another issue that prevented me from getting the German menu links at the bottom (Edit this page --> Diese Seite bearbeiten).
