Searching an nntp server for relevant newsgroups can be timeconsuming. I use the occur function to show me a list of newsgroups matching a regexp in the other window. Here are a couple of extra keybindings I defined so you can easily see the newsgroup description and toggle subscription from the occur buffer:

  (defun aleblanc/toggle-newsgroup-subscription-from-occur nil
    "Toggle subscription of newsgroup from occur buffer"
    (interactive)
    (other-window 1)
    (gnus-browse-unsubscribe-current-group 1)
    (other-window 1))
  (defun aleblanc/show-newsgroup-description nil
    "Show description of newsgroup from occur buffer"
    (interactive)
    (other-window 1)
    (call-interactively 'gnus-browse-describe-group)
    (other-window 1))
  (add-hook 'gnus-browse-mode-hook
  	    (lambda ()
  	      (define-key occur-mode-map (kbd "u") 'aleblanc/toggle-newsgroup-subscription-from-occur)
  	      (define-key occur-mode-map (kbd "d") 'aleblanc/show-newsgroup-description)))

-- aleblanc
