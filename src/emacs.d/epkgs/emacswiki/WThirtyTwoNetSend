Change history

;;; Changes between 1.0 and 1.1

;; - Changed the defcustom for w32-net-send-recipients so that the
;; w32-net-send function got smaller.

;;; Changes between 1.1 and 1.2

;; - Added signature option suggested by Niels Skou Olsen
;;   (nso AT manbw DOT dk)
;; - Added option to suggest text in the region as the message to send

;;; Changes between 1.2 and 1.2.1

;; - Just added some tips and trix

;;; Changes between 1.2 and 1.2.1

;; - Removed free variable username

;;; Changes between 1.2.1 and 1.3 (by Klaus Berndl <klaus.berndl@sdm.de>)

;; - Now `w32-net-send-dialog' supports the region too
;; - The option `w32-net-send-recipients' now allows to insert a recipient
;;   with a display alias (used for completion) and a seperate net-name (which
;;   is used for the net send command).
;; - Added a "*" before each defcustom-documentation to be conform
;;   with the Emacs documentation.
;; - Added some documentation
;; - Fixed a bug which prevents `w32-net-send' and `w32-net-send-dialog' from
;;   working when no region is active (e.g. directly after opening a buffer).
;; - No region is offered if (mark) and (point) are identical.
;; - Added some trimming stuff for strings for saver code

;;; Changes between 1.3 and 1.3.1

;; - Added option `w32-net-send-show-recipients' which allows you to
;;   add the recipients to the message (if you send a message to many
;;   persons at once you might want that all people should know about
;;   each other, similar to CC: vs BC: when sending e-mail)

This is what I have used for a long time, now. -- AlexSchroeder

 (defun net-message (recipient text)
   "Send a net message with Emacs.
 This needs Windows/NT, I think."
   (interactive "sEmpfaenger: \nsMessage: ")
   ;; Must have one resulting line of output so it automatically
   ;; displays the result in the echo area.  Not having ^M's in the
   ;; output is also nice.
   (shell-command (format "net send %s %s" recipient text)))
