== A Ruby Test Runner ==

##ruby-test.el## is an Emacs mode for running ruby language unit
tests (both kinds, test/unit and rspec) right from the editor, instead
of dropping to the command line. This also works for rails projects
where it picks the right script/spec script.

== Features ==
* Run whole file
* Re-running last test
* Run individual testcase or example
* Clickable backtraces
* Toggle test and implementation (for Rails, or using a customized mapping regex)

== How Tests Are Picked ==

The command `ruby-test-run-file' has three ways to pick the test to
run, and the first test that turns up gets picked for execution. 

# If you are in a test file buffer then this is run, otherwise the
# visible buffers get cycled, and if a test is found that is run, or
# lastly the last-run test will be re-run. 
  
The last option only can happend if the test has been executed in this
session before.  Test files are recognzed as such by their name,
i.e. they have to end in ##_test.rb## or ##_spec.rb##. The test output
goes into a buffer ##*Ruby-Test*## in ruby-test-mode, and if errors
or failures turn up, one can visit the relevant locations in code by
clicking the backtrace.

== Keys Bindings == 

This mode installs global key bindings for ##C-x SPC## and ##C-x
t##. They have to be global to make the "re-run last test" feature
work independently from where you are in the meantime. You can also
run the command as ##M-x ruby-test-run-file##.

Lisp:ruby-test.el

== Alternatives ==

An alternative package for a similar purpose is 
[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs/autotest.el autotest.el]
by RyanDavis.

Another alternative is Lisp:ruby-compilation.el by EricSchulte.

An rspec specific test runner: [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/RspecMode RspecMode]

== Discussion ==

Hi, isnt autotest, autotest-notifier better than this if your plan is to test
rails applications(with rspec) as it runs the test after you save the file and
even show the doom guy face :)?  -  Greboide

Anybody care to adapt this for shoulda? -koops

[new]
Autotest is a test file watcher, which runs the tests once you edited something.
That's not what I was after, even if that might be a good idea sometimes. ruby-test-mode
just runs tests (single or file-wise) from the editor window, and let's you click on any backtrace location you
might happen to see. Another difference is that autotest.el forks out to the ZenTest gem binary, an external program, which does
all the interesting stuff, so you have that as a dependency. --FlorianEbeling
