I'm new to Emacs because I've seen it can support Wiki for local editings with final HTML export possibility. Unfortunately I couldn't find any easy step-by-step installation guide to EmacsWikiMode. I hope this wiki can help me with my problem. --ArmaniDeluxe

EmacsMuse can handle different output formats and it is easier to hack. -- XueFuqiao
