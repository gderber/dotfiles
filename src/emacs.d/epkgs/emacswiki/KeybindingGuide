The Emacs Keybinding Guide by JariAalto will tell you more about
keybinding than you ever wanted to know.

* http://www.nongnu.org/emacs-tiny-tools/keybindings/

Very easy way:
* use <tt>M-x global-set-key</tt></b>
* hit the '''[[key sequence]]''' you want do bind
* type the command to be bound to the key sequence
* recall that previous command with <tt>C-x ESC ESC</tt> and copy the output you see, and there is the full lisp command which does the binding.

: This will show you <tt>[C-c C-S-f1]</tt> when you bind the key.but when you recall the command it may shrink to <tt>[3 C-S-f1]</tt>, so this method is not completely perfect."

I think it tells you more than you wanted to know in terms of mis-information and dubious opinion.  Please see the EmacsLisp manual.  If that doesn't help, make a bug report against it.  If you want examples of doing things portably between Emacs and XEmacs, have a look at Gnus, for instance.  -- Dave Love
