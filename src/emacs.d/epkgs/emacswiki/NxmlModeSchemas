This page is supposed to help you expand your collection of schemas for use in NxmlMode.

== Why Schemas? ==
Adding schemas to NxmlMode helps you turn a generic xml editor into one specific for your document, including content completion and validation.

== Acquiring Schemas ==
For standardized document formats, some kind of validation documents almost always exist.  Unfortunately, not all provide the RNC (RelaxNG compact syntax) schemas required by NxmlMode.  Luckily, however, some conversion tools are available. [http://relaxng.org/#conversion]

[new]
Otherwise, you can acquire and apply the schemas other than the RNC schemas by using [https://github.com/aki2o/emacs-genrnc genrnc.el]
--HiroakiOtsu

== Applying Schemas ==
The variable rng-schema-locating-files points to a list of XML files specifying when to use which schema based on file name or namespace.

Is it possible to have more then one schema per file?  For instance, can I have a buffer validate against an xhtml, jstl and svg schema?

Look at NxhtmlMode, which makes it possible.

Thanks Aaditya for your trust in NxhtmlMode, but unfortunately it can not do this.
At least I myself can not see any way to do this. 
What it can do is handle multiple major modes in a buffer with MuMaMo.
The XML parser however (which comes from NxmlMode) always handles the whole buffer.
And it uses the same DTD (schema) for the whole file.

But I must say I do not understand what Jonathan wants to do.

It seems that what jonathan is asking, if I understand correctly, is this: and single XML file normally has a single schema, often defined by using a namespace declaration on the root tag.  But XML allows you to have certain elements be parsed according to a different schema by having a namespace declaration attached to it,  just as the root node did. This allows for such fun things as embedding an SVG directly into an XHTML page just my using an svg element, and attaching a namespace declaration to it.

As I see it, this seems to be beyond the scope of nxhtml-mode, and should be handled by nxml-mode instead.  personally, I would be very happy to see this implemented.
--Matias

nxml-mode already support multiple schemas for an XML file (via namespaces as Matias describes above) --VagnJohansen


== Schema Collection ==
As finding and converting schemas can be a pain, here is a small collection.  Everybody please amend it.  Currently included are [http://ant.apache.org/ Ant], [http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/ SVG], [http://www.web3d.org/x3d/ X3D] and [http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/ XSL-FO] (thanks to MikeHostetler).

To add the schemas, add this to your .emacs:

  (push "~/path/to/schemas.xml" rng-schema-locating-files-default)
  (push (cons (concat "\\." (regexp-opt '("svg" "x3d") t)
                      "\\'") 'nxml-mode) auto-mode-alist)

Grab my [http://www.box.net/shared/px05ivmdqc fo-schemas.tar.bz2] file.  This has the schema for [http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/ xsl-fo].  I may have more, I will look later. -- MikeHostetler

Hi, I've uploaded some [http://apertium.org Apertium]-rng files if
you want to include them:
[http://www.student.uib.no/~kun041/doc/dix.rng dix.rng], [http://www.student.uib.no/~kun041/doc/modes.rng modes.rng], [http://www.student.uib.no/~kun041/doc/transfer.rng transfer.rng]

As of 2009-12-23 the wikiupload link just displays a blank page. - TobyCabot

Anybody interested in editing [http://www.jasperforge.org/jasperreports JasperReports] JRXML files?
I derived my jasperreports.rnc from one of the latest DTDs.
Sad enough they say, they abandon the DTD in favour of an XSD schema.
Let me know, if you are interested in jasperreports.rnc!
