This Turkish spammer is slowly getting to me.  I banned the entire !TurkTelekom network today,
and sent some mail to abuse@ttnet.net.tr.  We'll see what they say.

Interesting, however: No more Chinese industrial spam, now it is Turkish porn spam.  And he was clever enough to use just the IP as soon as his hostname was banned...

Spamming on wikis is just starting to get me hairy !!
