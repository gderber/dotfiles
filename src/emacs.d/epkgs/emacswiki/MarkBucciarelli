I use emacs daily on an NT box for work, and on RedHat and Debian boxes at home.

When I was in graduate school, RichardStallman hired me to type because his hands hurt to much.  My main recollection is that he expected you to have a good memory for  emacs key-stroke sequences; if he taught you an optimal navigation twice, he expected not to have to tell you a third time.

I have written some free software to help organizations with their bulk mailing parties--see http:\\www.easymailings.com.
