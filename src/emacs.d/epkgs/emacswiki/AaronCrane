I am Aaron Crane.  Bored people can look at http://pobox.com/~aaronc/

I've been using and hacking on Emacs for nearly a decade now, starting
with (I think) GNU Emacs 19.28.  I switched to XEmacs shortly after
the end of the Lucid days, and was happy with it for a long time.  I switched back to GNU Emacs in December 2003, purely to be able to use NxmlMode.

: Welcome to the Wiki!  I like the the term "government phonology", even though I did not understand the abstract... -- AlexSchroeder

: "government phonology"...this has to do with figuring out when Mike Rowe Soft is infringing on MicroSoft, no?  Ah, the infinite struggle to arrive at an objective standard about a subjective thing... ;) -- ChristopherSmith
