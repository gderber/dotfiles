Hi,

very good conclusion on Emacs For Mac OS, but some Packages on Mac OS Snow Leopard  hang by trying to compile. I have had several Problems with Org-Mode in one Modul - the Rest of Org-Mode compiles fine. I testet it with Homebrew, Ports and Aquamacs, ( GNU Emacs 24.5.1) and Org-Mode 8.2.10. Maybe it would a idea to include a Test of Package-Installation in this Site and give a short Feedback, which package does compile without problems. I would try now older package-versions for Org-Mode.

Sincerly
Thorsten

Regarding Homebrew, I prefer this variant:
<pre>
brew install railwaycat/emacsmacport/emacs-mac --with-gnutls --with-imagemagick --with-official-icon --with-xml2
</pre>

Here is why:

* TLS support is important for Gnus and IRC
* Image Magick is important to view and edit images
* XML is important for parsing documents
* I like the official icon and don't need to distinguish between this Emacs and any other "official" Emacs
