This package is obsolete, and is no longer maintained. Switch to [[Tries]] instead.

A ternary search tree stores data associated with "strings" (not necessarily the string data type; any ordered sequence of elements is also valid). It stores them in such a way that both storage size and data lookup are reasonably space- and time- efficient, respectively. But more importantly, returning all strings with a given prefix in alphabetical or any other sort-order is also time-efficient.

Requires [[Heaps]]. The last and final version (0.7.4, released May 2007) can still be obtained for now from:
