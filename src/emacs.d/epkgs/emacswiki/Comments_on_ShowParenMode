In the section How to show the matching paren when it is offscreen,
the code is useful but will cause an error.
I add the code in my .emacs and when I place the cursor after a curly brace,
the minibuffer first show the correct content I want. But then it displayed an
error message: Error running timer ‘show-paren-function’: (wrong-type-argument stringp t)
I don't know elisp. I tried google, but I didn't find solution.
Can anyone handle this and modify this page?
