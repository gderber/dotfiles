== Combined regular and balanced expressions (cexp) ==

Elisp file: [[cexp.el]].

Example of usage: Try the following within the scratch buffer.
Run the first line. Thereafter, point moves to the end of the second line because it finds a match for the cexp.
To see the calculated match data run the third line.
<pre>
(setq m (search-forward-cexp "f\\!([[:alpha:]]\\*\\!(.*\\!)\\!)=h\\!(.*\\!)"))
f(x,x+a*(y+x),z)=h(x)
(loop for x on m by 'cddr collect (buffer-substring-no-properties (car x) (cadr x)))
</pre>
