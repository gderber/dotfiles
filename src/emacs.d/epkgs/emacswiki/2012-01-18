If you can vote in the USA, please do me a favor and call your representative to protest [WikiPedia:SOPA SOPA] and [WikiPedia:PIPA PIPA].
I know how hard it is -- I live in Switzerland and often I can't get myself to vote even though we can send our votes by snail mail.
I'm asking you to do it for Emacs Wiki. I can't see myself fighting any legal battles for it -- and if these bills don't get passed, I hopefully will never have to.
In this globalized world, the arm of the USA legal system has grown long indeed.
The [https://www.eff.org/ Electronic Frontier Foundation] has more information on the [https://blacklist.eff.org/ Internet Blacklist Legislation].

Anyway, if you can vote in the USA: visit [http://AmericanCensorship.org/ AmericanCensorship.org] or any of the many other sites out there for instructions on contacting your Senator.
Apparently some sites even offer to call them by phone, eg. [http://www.stopthewall.us/ Make the Call, Stop the Wall].
I understand that making phone calls can be embarrassing. I certainly hate them. Perhaps it helps if you remember that it's their /job/ to have the phone answered.
