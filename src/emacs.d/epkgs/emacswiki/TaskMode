TaskMode is a window configuration manager by MatthieuLemerre.

It provides some features such as switching to tasks when switching to buffers (useful for instance if you use EmacsIRCClient and use C-c C-SPC to switch to it) and using rules to automatically put your buffers in the right tasks. It also come with a (not complete) texinfo documentation.

It is still quite young so many improvements will come in the future, such as better frame support.
