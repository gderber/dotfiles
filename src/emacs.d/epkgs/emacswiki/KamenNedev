Hi.


I'm Kamen Nedev. I use Emacs. I've been using it for about four years now. So I
suppose this makes me a TOTAL newbie.


* Things I like about Emacs: its power, its logic, its capacity to metamorphose
  into anything and everything.

* Things I use it for: Translation (RemembranceAgents, LookUp, FlySpell), web
  development(NxmlMode), programming (Interactive Fiction, some Python, some
  Perl, and a lot of EmacsLisp, obviously), and... erm.... just about everything else
  ([[NewsTicker]], [[JabberEl]], [[ERC]]...)

* Emacs packages I'm hooked on: NewsTicker, WThreeM, MalyonMode, OrgMode,
MuseMode (yay!), AucTeX (nothing beats the Emacs-AUCTeX-BibCite-RefTeX!).

* Stuff I've got into more recently: [[ERC]] (+bitlbee), [[EmacsLispScreen]], and I'm working my way towards switching completely to [[Gnus]] for my mail and news needs.

* More recently, I have found the use of [[emacs-w3m]] with some popular online
  a nice change from the bells&whistles of AJAX. I have documented it here:
