Hi.  When I use deft, it correctly shows all of my files, but doesn't filter at all once I start typing text.  I can see what I am typing showing up after "Deft: " on the first line, but the list of files never changes.

GNU Emacs 24.2.1 (i386-mingw-nt6.1.7601)
 of 2012-08-28 on MARVIN

My config:

(require 'deft)
(setq deft-extension "txt")
(setq deft-directory "~/../../notes")
(setq deft-use-filename-as-title t)
(global-set-key [f8] 'deft)

Any ideas?

Thanks!

The problem is a missing <code>(require 'cl)</code> statement in <code>deft.el</code>.  Deft uses the `every' function from `cl-extra'.  This issue is fixed in the latest development version.

When I use Deft, it starts showing duplicates in the list of files.

To replicate:

1.) Create a new note
2.) Exit Emacs
3.) Open Emacs
4.) Open the file using the Deft list
5.) Add some text to the top of the file
6.) Switch back to the Deft list. Two duplicate entries of the file will appear.

Is this project dead?

I have downloaded the latest deft.el (0.5.1) from this site: http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/ (also see git: http://jblevins.org/git/deft.git/)
And have both the problems:
- filtering based on input doesn't work as described by mattm
- duplicate files as described by max

Is this project dead?

I've just tried this now. I have deft.el in a folder called lisp below. Adding the folder to the load path and then adding the Add command below gets it working.

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp")
Add (load "deft.el")
