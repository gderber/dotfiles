ELIM is an elisp instant messenger daemon (using libpurple), with a sexp based control protocol. Developed by fledermaus.

== Obtaining ELIM ==

* The [https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/elim savannah page]
* [https://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=elim tarballs] (the most recent one is usually what you should get).
* [http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/elim.git git repo browser]

The README included should tell you everything you need to know to get started with basic IM functionality.

The reference IM client implemented on top of ELIM is Garak, it is included with in the ELIM tarball.

* [[ELIM on Mac OS X]]
* [[ELIM Configuration]]

== Supported Protocols ==

* GroupWise
* ICQ
* IRC
* MSN
* MySpaceIM
* QQ

'''Question''':
* Is anyone successfully using this with sipe? I have it working with pidgin but can't get it to work with elim... http://sipe.sourceforge.net/ --mgalgs
** I have this kind of issue, too. LINE by Naver works with pidgin or finch but not with elim... Does Elim read ~/.purple ? If not, thirdparty plugins seems to be unavailable... -- maswag

== Wish list ==

* Replace libpurple with telepathy (pretty please?). ;)
** Investigating adding telepathy support. ETA not-very-soon, busy with many things.
** Just curious, why? --mgalgs
* Make an ELPA package for it. (An ELPA package doesn't really make sense since ELIM is a C program. Distributing the elisp portion by itself is not that helpful. --technomancy)
* Notify the user when a new message is received.
** '''DONE'''
* Tab-completion for nicks (in IRC and MUCs).  An IRC client can't be without that! :)
