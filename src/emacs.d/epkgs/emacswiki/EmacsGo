<pre>
;; I thought it would be fun to write a go program in lisp.

;; I'm not done, but I do have a functional goban.

;; The next step I'd like to add is "simple" -- counting the final
;; score.  This simple step seems to require not-inconsiderable go
;; knowledge.

;; Anyone interested in helping?
