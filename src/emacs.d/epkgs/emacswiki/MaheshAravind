=Emacs is Editor Ultimatum...=

I'll add up flavour when I get time.. (sorry!)

I'm a Emacs newbie, by the way.  Just started using Emacs in late 2003.

Here's my favourite elisp code (that I do first, everytime I want to customize new Emacs installs)

<pre>
;; No menu bar in the console mode
(if (eq (symbol-value 'window-system) nil)
    (menu-bar-mode -1))
</pre>

This one gives more screen space in text-only terminals!  Just my 2&cent;...
