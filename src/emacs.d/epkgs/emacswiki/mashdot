London, UK based Emacs user since 2009. 

I have been contributing to various mailing lists such as Mu4e, Org-Mode usually under the alias "mashdot" or simply just "'Mash". 

I may also be the only person still using [[Bongo]].

== Used modes== 
Will update these as I find the time and remember to.
* [[Bongo]]
* [[mu4e]]
* [[InteractivelyDoThings]]
* [[TempbufMode]]
* [[OrgMode]]
