== Yii-el ==
Yii-el is a script. It provides some commands for navigating Yii projects. It supports the two Yii directory structures: basic and advanced layouts.

The advantage of this script is that you can open any model/view/controller and migration files typing less.

The script is hosted here: https://bitbucket.org/cnngimenez/yii-el

Yii-el depends on:
* [[Ivy]] for autocompleting (see [https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/tree/2a02343cdf218441158e83323ce507a6d9112445 Ivy repository]).
* Use some functions from [[dash]] library (see [https://github.com/magnars/dash.el#functions dash repository]).
== Instalation ==
Download the script into a directory listed at the ##load-path##. Then load the library using ##(load-library "yii")## or ##(require "yii")##.

== Usage ==

# Tell Yii-el where is the base directory of your Yii project: ##M-x yii-init## ( ##C-cyi## ).
** Yii-el will show which type of layout detects: if it is a base or advance project.
# Open your file with ##M-x yii-???## (##C-cy?##) which ##???## (##?##) can be model (m), view (v), controller (c) or migration (M).
** Yii-el uses Ivy for autocompleting. You just have to type some letters to select the file you want to open. 

For example: ##C-cym## will ask for a model file.

In case of the ##yii-view## will ask for the view directory, and then for the view file to open. For example: if you want to open the view film/_form.php template type ##C-cyv##  ##film##, press return, ##form## and press return again.

== Key bindings ==
Yii-el provides some global key bindings:

* C-cyi : ##yii-init##
* C-cym : ##yii-model##
* C-cyv : ##yii-view##
* C-cyc : ##yii-controller##
* C-cyM : ##yii-migration##
