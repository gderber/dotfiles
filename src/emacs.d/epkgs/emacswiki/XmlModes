Various modes exist to edit XML.   See also: XmlParsers.

= XML editing modes =

== sgml-mode.el ==
The simplest mode to edit XML with is sgml-mode.  It comes with Emacs.

It is no longer the default.  To use it add the following to your InitFile.

  (defalias 'xml-mode 'sgml-mode 
    "Use `sgml-mode' instead of nXML's `xml-mode'.")

== PSGML ==
The biggest and greatest SGML mode will handle XML as well.  See
PsgmlMode.

== PSGMLx ==
psgmlx is a preconfigured set of popular elisp packages used for authoring SGML/XML and related documents with FSF/GNU Emacs.

== nXMLMode ==
NxmlMode was the next big thing in XML editing with Emacs.  As of 2009-09-18 it became the default XML mode.

Tim Bray says:

: There are 12,587 lines of elisp here apparently implementing a complete XML 1.0 processor and RelaxNG validation engine. Words fail me. [http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/09/18/NXML]

== XML-poly ==
"XML-poly is an XML parser on Emacs. Unlike the former xml.el, XML-poly treats XML names as symbols, of course it can distinguish them by their XML namespace URI." 

* http://www.meadowy.org/xml/ 

== xml-lite.el ==
This package provides a simple indentation engine for XML.  It is
intended for use in situations where the full power of PsgmlMode (DTD
parsing, syntax checking) is not required.  xml-lite is designed to be
used in conjunction with the default sgml-mode, to provide a
lightweight XML-editing environment.

* http://www.dogbiscuit.org/mdub/software/xml-lite.el

xml-lite.el has been merged with sgml-mode.el in Emacs CVS, and will be part of 22.1 when it is released.

== XML Authoring Environment (XAE) ==
The ultimate XML editing environment by PaulKinnucan.  It enables you
to use Emacs and a browser to create, transform, and display XML
documents. The XAE requires Java.

== XSL-Mode ==
A modified version of xslide, made into a derived mode of PsgmlMode.  Features intelligent abbreviation expansion.  Part of a future project for editing specific XML document types.  See EmaXML.

A simple call to sgml-validate can also allow you to validate using a local application (e.g. xmllint) as indicated by this thread: http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/docbook-apps/200211/msg00373.html.
