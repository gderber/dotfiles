==About me==

Hi all,

I'm an Emacs fan from several years (since 2000) now. I use Emacs 23 on Ubuntu.
I'm a French Ass. professor (sorry for my bad English) working on Software Engineering.
Fan of Gnus and org-mode (still trying to master them).
Facing an emacs bankruptcy, I'm currently looking for different autoloaders and package installer, like :
* [[Grail]]
* [[ELPA]]
* [[Pases]]
* InstallElisp
* AutoInstall
* ...

After a month of experiments, I switch to [[ELPA]] for the following reasons :
* Rumors that ELPA will be integrated in the next Emacs version
* Very simple to configure
* Some interesting module are already packaged
* I discover the fabulous [http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/ Emacs starter kit] and its version in org file [http://github.com/eschulte/emacs-starter-kit Starter kit documented in org-mode file], and the starter kit use ELPA...

Then, now, thanks to [http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/org-babel.php org-babel mode], I could make literacy programming for my configuration file : in one file, I could put my explanations in org-mode format (with cute outline and table facility) and my emacs lisp code. The lisp code is automatically tanggled and the documentation (pdf ou html) could be generated ! It's now much easier to navigate in my different configuration files.

Concerning the package installer, my main preoccupation was to get something which automatize the org-mode installation (org-mode is very active and there are dailies updates), none of the tested installers address this requirement.
Fortunately, the org-mode community gets [http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-track.php org-track], an automatic installer of org-mode...
Finally, thanks to [http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/org-babel-screen.php Org-babel screen], something similar to [http://angg.twu.net/eev-article.html eev mode] but with org-mode style, from an emacs file, I could also execute shell-script to automatize others packages installations. All my configuration staff are in the same files, it is now easier to manage.

My emacs bankruptcy seems to be avoided.

I still face some problems in the use of [http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/org-babel-screen.php Org-babel screen], but this module is very recent and few documented (in November 2009).
