[https://github.com/Lindydancer/objc-font-lock Objc Font Lock] is a package that highlights Objective-C method calls, written by [[AndersLindgren|Anders Lindgren]].

Objective-C use a syntax for method calls it has inherited from Smalltalk. Unfortunately, this syntax is frustratingly hard to read -- when browsing through code, method calls tend to "disappear" as they are different from normal C function calls.

By highlighting method calls, it is possible to read the same piece of code faster and more accurate.
