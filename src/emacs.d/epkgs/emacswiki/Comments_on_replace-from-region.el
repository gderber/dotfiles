Hi Rubikitch.  FYI, <tt>[[replace+.el]]</tt> has something similar that might fulfill your need.  Non-`nil' option `search/replace-region-as-default-flag' means that query-replacing uses the active region text as the default (for both old and new, so you can easily choose which or edit for both).  There is also a toggle command for the option.
