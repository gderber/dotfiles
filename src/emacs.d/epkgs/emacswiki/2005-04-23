A CategoryEmacsWikiSite category has been created to centralize material to this wiki, EmacsWiki.
Are there any suggestions on what the ordering should be:  Alphabetical or importance?

As EmacsWiki grows, good strategies for organizing the site will become more and more crucial
for maintaining the usefulness  of the site.  Thanks to DrewAdams for this great idea.

''Why not call this CategoryThisWiki? "CategoryEmacsWikiSite" is long and unmemorable.''

I thought of naming this "<nowiki>CategoryEmacsWiki</nowiki>", but "<nowiki>EmacsWiki</nowiki>" seems to now have two independent meanings: 1) Emacs software for Wiki stuff (WikiModes), 2) this site (EmacsWiki). So I named it CategoryEmacsWikiSite to restrict the meaning to #2. Yes, "Wiki" and "Site" together is a bit redundant, but so be it. -- DrewAdams
