DiredMode is the mode of a '''[::Dired]''' buffer. It shows a directory (folder) listing that you can use to perform various operations on files and subdirectories in the directory.  The operations you can perform are numerous, from creating subdirectories to byte-compiling files, searching files, and of course visiting (editing) files.

The closest thing to Dired in MS Windows is Windows Explorer.  In Emacs, we sometimes speak of "editing" a directory, not "exploring" it, but the behavior is similar.

The best way to learn about Dired is to try it out: type `C-x d' or `C-x 4 d' and enter a directory name. Then, try various Dired commands. The most important are available on the [[menu bar]] menus '''Operate''', '''Mark''', '''Regexp''', '''Immediate''', and '''Subdir'''. Use the menu to discover some of what is available; the menu also indicates the key sequences you can use as an alternative.

It's possible to assign DedicatedKeys keys, such as ##S-<f1>## (##shift+F1##), to open up a directory listing.  For example, adding the following to your InitFile allows ##S-<f1>## to visit your home directory in Dired Mode.

{{{
(global-set-key (kbd "S-<f1>")
  (lambda ()
    (interactive)
    (dired "~/")))
}}}

You can read more about Dired mode by reading the help displayed using `C-h m' in a Dired buffer. Even more information is available in the EmacsManual: `C-h i', choose Emacs, then choose Dired under Advanced Features. (Or read [[Manual:Dired]] online.)







== Vanilla Dired distributed with Gnu Emacs ==

* [[Dired X]] -- Many extra features (library ##dired-x.el##).
* DiredOmitMode -- Selectively remove files and subdirectories from the display, to reduce clutter.
* DiredSearchAndReplace -- Search multiple files.
* [[WDired]] -- Rename files by editing names directly in the Dired buffer.










[:DiredEnhancements]
== Dired tips and additional features ==

* [[Anything]] -- After evaluating ##(anything-dired-bindings)##, some dired commands are replaced with Anything-based interface.
* [[Bookmark+]] -- (1) In the bookmark list, `##M-d >##' opens Dired on the marked file and directory bookmarks (only). (2) In Dired, `C-j' jumps among different "views" or states of the same Dired buffer. (3) You can bookmark any Dired buffer -- its current state. Jump among Dired bookmarks using `J' in Dired (or `C-x j d' globally). (4) In Dired, `M-b' bookmarks each of the marked files and dirs.
* [[Dired+]] -- Extends standard Emacs libraries ##dired.el##, ##dired-aux.el##, and ##dired-x.el## in many ways.
* DiredBookmarks -- Save/restore Dired state persistently, including switches, marked files, inserted subdirectories, and hidden (sub)directories.
* DiredDetails -- Lets you hide or show the file and directory details in a Dired listing, to save space and clutter. When details are hidden, all you see (and all IncrementalSearch sees) are the file names.
* DiredDragAndDrop -- Lets you drag-and-drop files.
* DiredEfap -- Rename the file at [[point]] in Dired.
* [[Diredful]] -- Colorful file names in dired buffers.
* [[DiredFileTypeFaces]] -- Colorful file names in dired buffers.
* DiredPower -- Various Dired tips and features.
* DiredReuseDirectoryBuffer – Make Dired reuse an existing Dired buffer
* DiredSorting -- Dired tips and addons for sorting listings
* DiredSortCriterias -- minimalistic dired sorting by different criterias
* DiredSync -- Synchronize directories within dired
* DiredTar - extension for creating and unpacking tar-files from Dired
* DiredTweaks -- Small Dired tweaks.
* DiredView -- Browse and select files using the first character of their names.
* [https://gitlab.com/xuhdev/dired-icon dired-icon] -- display file icons in dired buffers.
* [https://github.com/fasheng/dired-toggle dired-toggle.el] -- provide a simple way to toggle dired buffer for current directory, similar to `dired-jump'(`C-x C-j')
* [http://user42.tuxfamily.org/dired-visit-history/index.html dired-visit-history.el] -- add dired visits to <code>file-name-history</code>
* [[Files+]] -- 
** Integrates `find-file' (`C-x C-f') and related commands with Dired
** Together with <tt>[[ls-lisp+.el]]</tt>, modifies `insert-directory' so that Dired's second header line lists the number of files:
 '''##files 691##''' ##space used 49439 available 56233408##
* [[GrepMode#GrepOnlyMarkedFiles|`grep' the marked files]]
* [[Icicles - Dired Enhancements]] -- [[minibuffer]] [[regexp]] [[completion]] and completion-candidate [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]] to navigate directories and perform operations on files
** [[Icicles - Dired Enhancements#SearchAndReplace|Search-and-replace]] on the marked files.
** [[Icicles - Dired Enhancements#SaveFilesAsCandidates|Save marked file names]] as completion candidates for later reuse.
** [[Icicles - Dired Enhancements#OpenDiredOnSavedFiles|Open Dired on saved file names]] (`##C-M-<##'), that is, names that you previously saved as an Emacs [[fileset]] or as an Icicles completion candidates set.
* Isearch
** DiredIsearch -- Run `isearch' in Dired, but match only file names
** DiredLis -- Letter `isearch' in dired mode, not nedd press some keys to active `isearch-mode'.
* OperatingOnFilesInDired – Opening files in associated applications.
* ThumbsMode -- Modify dired for automatic image previewing.
* [[Trashcan]] -- A recoverable file-deletion system that behaves like the trash can or recycle bin of many operating systems.
* [[Tumme]] -- Lets you navigate among image files in Dired, with thumbnail previews and more.






== Windows specific tips and additional features ==

* DiredWThirtyTwoTweaks
* MsShellExecute -- Open any file from dired on W32 systems
* WThirtyTwoFindDired -- Light, w32-specific version of `find-dired'.
