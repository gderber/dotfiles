== Very similar databases ==

If you have two very similar databases (one on your laptop and one
on your workstation), then the easiest method is probably ediff.  Use
M-x ediff to compare the two files.

M-x bbdb-merge-file does this for you.

== Very different databases ==

If you want to merge two very different databases (one from your
girlfriend, one from yourself), your best bet is to just concatenate
the two.  Then start the BBDB, and use M-x bbdb-show-duplicates.  For
every record that appears twice, put point on the second record, and
use `r' to merge it into the first record.
