New Emacs pretest available, for those of us who like to live on the bleeding edge and report bugs.

* http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/

* http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/

Enjoy!? :)

I've also added some more anti-spam measures:

* usernames ending in a number (we've had this for a while now, maybe no longer required?)

* the word ##по####рно## (porn) (I copied this from elsewhere, not sure whether it's a problem on this site, actually)

* the regexp "<a\s+href=" (I know it's malformed HTML, but that's what they post...)

Pages BannedContent and BannedHosts remain in effect, I think. :)
