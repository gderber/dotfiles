The following code for [[rcirc]] allows you to use the ##/all## command to
run a command for all your connections.  This only makes sense if you actually
have multiple connections, eg. you are connected to multiple servers or you
are using several nicks on the same server.

Examples:

    /all away food
    /all away
    /all quit zzzz

== Code ==

<pre>
(eval-after-load 'rcirc
  '(defun-rcirc-command all (input)
     "Run the arguments as a command for all connections.
Example use: /all away food or /all quit zzzz."
     (interactive "s")
     (let ((buffers (mapcar 'process-buffer (rcirc-process-list))))
       (dolist (buf buffers)
	 (with-current-buffer buf
	   (goto-char (point-max))
	   (insert "/" input)
	   (rcirc-send-input))))))
</pre>
