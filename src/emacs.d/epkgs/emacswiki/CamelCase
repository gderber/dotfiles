That funky naming scheme where the first letter of every word is capitalized and all the words are joined together without spaces.

This scheme is also called StudlyCaps or "intercapping" by some people.
GlassesMode is the StudlyCaps specific minor-mode that comes with Emacs.

For those runnning an up-to-date version of Emacs (22.1 or newer) an alternative to both CamelCase and GlassesMode is already built in c-mode. Just activate the c-subword-mode (subword-mode since 23.2) and it works out of the box. As usual you can activate this minor mode manually, typing (M-x c-subword-mode) or programmatically (using hooks). It also works in non-CC Mode buffers. Enjoy!

: I'm running GNU Emacs 23.2 and c-subword-mode is not implemented (that is, the function is defined, but useful implementation is missing).  A notice into the body of the function says to report a bug to have it implemented.

: Try subword-mode (without the "c-").

There's a minor mode for CamelCase (M-x camelCase-mode), written by C. R. Manning, that allows for forward-word and backward-word to stop at each word within a CamelCase word.  It's now available from http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~leavens/emacs/camelCase/camelCase-mode.el with instructions and commentary at http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~leavens/emacs/camelCase/camelCase-mode.html

And http://www.sixfingeredman.net/proj/xemacs/camelCase-mode.el is a hacked version which actually replaces forward-word and backward-word so that all word-related functions work with camelCase (when the mode is on).

: Not sure where else to go for help on this, but I used the above and it's suggested autoload initialization, and I have a problem.  Once I open a .cpp file and camelCase-mode turns on automatically, forward-word and backward-word are broken in any buffer not using camelCase-mode.  It tells me, "if: Wrong number of arguments: #<subr forward-word>, 2" --BryanMurdock

:: Had the same problem but fixed it by downloading camelCase.tgz instead from http://www.hotdispatch.com/download/ip/14312566/739119894/camelCase.tgz --tankboy

:: The above link is dead. I've made a fixed version at http://paste.lisp.org/display/130705//raw

::: I must say that I greatly prefer this having a global effect instead of a buffer local effect.   To change the behavior to be global is very simple.  Here's a diff output for such a change:

For cycling text between various styles (CamelCase, snake_case, lowerCamelCase, etc) use the string-inflection package (available in MELPA, or at https://github.com/akicho8/string-inflection).

    ;; Cycle between snake case, camel case, etc.
    (require 'string-inflection)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c i") 'string-inflection-cycle)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C") 'string-inflection-camelcase)        ;; Force to CamelCase
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c L") 'string-inflection-lower-camelcase)  ;; Force to lowerCamelCase
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c J") 'string-inflection-java-style-cycle) ;; Cycle through Java styles

This makes the suggestions below obsolete.

        (while (string-match "[A-Z]" s (or start 1))

Has anyone else seen a problem with http://www.sixfingeredman.net/proj/xemacs/camelCase-mode.el where M-f and M-b work as expected, but C-left uses the original forward-word logic?  C-right is fine for some reason.  Overall this mode is very neat and helpful, thanks to all who have worked on it.

Ok, here's my cycling variant:

    (defun split-name (s)
      (split-string
       (let ((case-fold-search nil))
	 (downcase
	  (replace-regexp-in-string "\\([a-z]\\)\\([A-Z]\\)" "\\1 \\2" s)))
       "[^A-Za-z0-9]+"))

    (defun camelcase  (s) (mapconcat 'capitalize (split-name s) ""))
    (defun underscore (s) (mapconcat 'downcase   (split-name s) "_"))
    (defun dasherize  (s) (mapconcat 'downcase   (split-name s) "-"))
    (defun colonize   (s) (mapconcat 'capitalize (split-name s) "::"))

    (defun camelscore (s)
      (cond ((string-match-p "\\(?:[a-z]+_\\)+[a-z]+" s)	(dasherize  s))
	    ((string-match-p "\\(?:[a-z]+-\\)+[a-z]+" s)	(camelcase  s))
	    ((string-match-p "\\(?:[A-Z][a-z]+\\)+$"  s)	(colonize   s))
	    (t						(underscore s)) ))

    (defun camelscore-word-at-point ()
      (interactive)
      (let* ((case-fold-search nil)
	     (beg (and (skip-chars-backward "[:alnum:]:_-") (point)))
	     (end (and (skip-chars-forward  "[:alnum:]:_-") (point)))
	     (txt (buffer-substring beg end))
	     (cml (camelscore txt)) )
	(if cml (progn (delete-region beg end) (insert cml))) ))

----

The cycling method above did not work for me, but I was able to redefine camelscore as:

    (defun camelscore (s)	
      (cond ((string-match-p "\:"  s)	(camelcase s))
	    ((string-match-p "-" s)     (colonize s))
	    ((string-match-p "_" s)	(dasherize s))
	    (t                          (underscore s)) ))

Bind the following to some-key, write as snake case, then press the key!

Dependency: camelize

    (defun camelize-previous-snake (&optional beg end)
      "Camelize the previous snake cased string.
    
    If transient-mark-mode is active and a region is activated,
    camelize the region."
      (interactive "r")
      (unless (and (boundp 'transient-mark-mode) transient-mark-mode mark-active)
        (setq end (point)
              beg (+ (point) (skip-chars-backward "[:alnum:]_"))))
      (save-excursion
        (let ((c (camelize (buffer-substring-no-properties beg end))))
          (delete-region beg end)
          (goto-char beg)
          (insert c))))

To check spelling of camel-cased words, you need to switch the default ispell program to aspell.

  (setq ispell-program-name "aspell")
  ;; -C makes aspell accept run-together words
  ;; --run-together-limit is maximum number of words that can be strung together.
  (setq ispell-extra-args '("-C" "--sug-mode=ultra" "--run-together-limit=5"))

A better solution to check spelling of camel-cased words is https://github.com/redguardtoo/wucuo

It supports both aspell and hunspell. No extra setup required. Just works out of box.
