I am [::bkz], an Emacs user for about 4 years now and as expected I'm slowly becoming more and more sheltered inside Emacs. 

I think of my Emacs setup as my own customized OSAL (Operating System Abstraction Layer) which allows me to work on Windows, OSX/FreeBSD and Linux without too much headache. If only we could have WebKit integrated into Emacs somehow...

My homepage is at http://www.zafar.se and I intend to put most of my (future) projects on GitHub: http://github.com/bkz/
