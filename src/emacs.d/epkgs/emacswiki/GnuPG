To use GnuPG with MailCrypt you should

<pre>
(mc-setversion "gpg")
(setq mc-gpg-user-id "user@foo.dom")
</pre>

This is all the customization I've done to MailCrypt to make it work with GnuPG.


I have been having trouble getting MailCrypt to work on windows, 
and I didn't want to depend on cygwin's sh.exe, 
so I wrote an independent gpg mode that only requires
a working gpg setup: Lisp:dgpg.el    -- DavidElentok
