I am [::wrobel] on #emacs or #gentoo-web (Freenode IRC)

Most of my editing is done with emacs. I especially enjoy the combination of Emacs, muse-mode and pyblosxom to publish my homepage at http://www.gunnarwrobel.de.

I am a developer in the Gentoo team and maintain the packages

* muse
* planner
* delicious

in the portage tree.
