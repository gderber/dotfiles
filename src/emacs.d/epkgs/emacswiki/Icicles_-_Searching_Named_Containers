== Chapter & Verse: Searching Named Containers ==

Some '''Icicles''' [[multi-command]]s, such as `icicle-buffer' ('''`C-x b''''),
`icicle-file' ('''`C-x C-f''''), `icicle-visit-marked-file-of-content'
('''`C-F'''' in [[Dired]]), and `icicle-Info-goto-node' ('''`g'''' in [[Info]]),
access ''containers'' of text ([[buffer]], file, [[Info]] node) by name.

When this is the case, '''Icicles''' provides [[multi-completion]]
candidates, the first part being the container ''name'' and the second
part being the entire ''content'' of the container with that name (the
buffer, file, or node text).

You can think of these as '''[::chapter-and-verse]''' commands: you name a
chapter or you search for a verse among chapters.  Or you do both
at the same time, searching particular chapters for particular
verses.

The second multi-completion part (the verse, or content)
is never shown in `*Completions*', and you can ignore it
altogether if you want.  If you do not use `C-M-j' followed by a
content-matching pattern, then no content-searching occurs, which
is of course quicker than searching lots of text.

But if the container (chapter) names are not enough to help you
locate some information, then you can search the content instead.
Or you can match both at the same time: one pattern for the name
and another for the content.  Each pattern is optional.

When you search using a chapter-&-verse command, all you care
about is whether the content matches your input.  '''Icicles''' looks
for only one content match in a given container.  In other words,
the second part of your input just ''filters'' candidates, retaining
only those containers whose contents match.

This is a powerful and unique way to search.  Of course there are
commands, such as `grep', that act similarly, but they are
generally not incremental: letting you change name and/or content
pattern on the fly as you see the corresponding matches.

'''[[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview|Icicles search]]''' (e.g., `##C-c `##') has some similarities.  It lets you
first choose a set of files or buffers to search, then it shows you
the search hits as you change your content-matching pattern.  But
with '''Icicles''' search you cannot change the set of containers to search incrementally:
you choose them at the outset once and for all, before you start
to search.

For '''Icicles''' search commands the emphasis is thus on the content
search.  For '''Icicles''' chapter-&-verse commands the emphasis is not
on searching; the aim is just to identify and go to a given
container.  Searching is just one way to find the right container.

Chapter-&-verse commands access a container in the same way,
whether or not they search it contents.  They do not move to
any search-hit location.  For instance, `icicle-file' (`C-x C-f') simply
visits the chosen file, just as `find-file' would.

But you can search the container after you visit it, using
`C-M-s' or `C-M-r' ([[regexp]] [[Isearch]]).  Whenever a content search is
successful the content search pattern is added to `regexp-search-ring'
when you hit `S-TAB'.  So when the chapter-&-verse command is finished you can
immediately search for content matches incrementally (`C-M-s').

(You can also work in the other direction, reusing an Isearch
regexp as a content-matching regexp.  See
[[Icicles - History Enhancements#InsertPreviousInputs|Using Completion to Insert Previous Inputs: `M-o']].)

This on-the-fly, on-demand content-matching can be quite handy.
But as a general rule it is a good idea to first narrow down the
set of candidates by matching container names before you set off
to also search content.  Otherwise, if you have many or large
containers with no content matches then you will waste time
searching unnecessarily.  It is also generally a good idea to
temporarily turn off '''Icicles''' [[Icicles - Icompletion#CompletionsIcompletion|incremental completion]] and [[IcompleteMode]] when you search container content.
