To read mail with VM from a POP spool, an entry specifying the
maildrop is needed in <code>vm-spool-files</code>. This can be
configured using, for example:

    (add-to-list 'vm-spool-files
                 '("~/mail/POP-INBOX"
                   "pop:HOST:PORT:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD"
                   "~/mail/POP-INBOX.CRASH"))

where PORT is normally 110. To use POP over SSL, use, instead:

    (add-to-list 'vm-spool-files
                 '("~/mail/POP-INBOX"
                   "pop-ssl:HOST:PORT:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD"
                   "~/mail/POP-INBOX.CRASH"))

where PORT is normally 995. In both cases, if PASSWORD is given as *,
it will be prompted for the first time that mail is retrieved.

AUTH will normally be "pass".  See the docstring of vm-spool-files for
the other acceptable values and their meanings.

By default, messages are removed from the POP server after retrieving
them. This is controlled by the variable
<code>vm-pop-expunge-after-retrieving</code>, but per-maildrop
settings can be made in <code>vm-pop-auto-expunge-alist</code>.

Other variables controlling POP behaviour include:

    vm-pop-bytes-per-session
    vm-pop-max-message-size
    vm-pop-messages-per-session
