I am member of the ChurchOfEmacs, development section. I have written a number of modes, which you can download from my home page:

* a programmer's interface to PostGreSQL
* BabelMode, which uses translation engines such as babelfish to translate text. 
* DictWeb mode, which looks up dictionary definitions from dict.org
* CoffeeMode, an Emacs implementation of the Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (RFC2324)
* EmacsHttpd, a web server embedded in the Emacs
* InternetPrintingProtocol (IPP)

I would love one day to use a CommonLispEmacs.
