This page already exists, it's called WikiTodo.  AlexSchroeder and I were recently talking about this and agreed it didn't really motivate anyone to fix things. We could probably put this tag on every page of the Wiki! :) -- AaronHawley

I'm always hopeful that somebody will figure out how to do it and motivate others. Let's hope they succeed where we failed.

Bah. I just noob'ed all over our wiki..  Sorry. :P  It's been a little while since I have really played on EmacsWiki.  Thanks for the sentiment Alex!

There are different kinds of todos that require different levels of effort and expertise. Differentiating them with different tags will be able to encourage newer users to contribute on the easier stuff.

In my code I use: doc, warn, todo, hack, refactor.

The latter two are obiuously more difficult than the former.
