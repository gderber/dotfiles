Lisp:worklog.el is used to keep track of time you spend on tasks. It allows you to summarize the tasks for easy overview of how much time you spent on tasks.

Lisp:worklog.el was created by KaiGrossjohann but since version 2.0 it is maintained by ArjenWiersma.

Since version 2.3 worklog.el is compatible between GNU Emacs and XEmacs.

I put up my development version on github: http://github.com/credmp/worklog/tree/master

The actual homepage of the mode moved to: http://www.credmp.org/WorkLog.html

I found that worklog is nice but the fact that it has to switch to the .worklog buffer was pretty annoying.

I wrote a cheezy hack to get around it. I'm not a very talented ELisp hacker so please feel free to better this code.

    (defun worklog-quick-start (task)
      (interactive "sTask: ")
      (let (curbuf (current-buffer))
           (worklog-do-task task t)
           (switch-to-buffer curbuf t)))

    (defun worklog-quick-stop ()
      (interactive)
      (let (curbuf (current-buffer))
           (worklog-task-stop)
           (switch-to-buffer curbuf t)))

Cool! I will take this into the development version of worklog... probably more people would like to use this :)

I use worklog.el for all my time tracking, and it's been very good so far.

It wouldn't be bad if I could either do a *worklog_summary* page in hh:mm or hours and (decimal) fractional hours.  It's easy to convert the few entries under tasks; it's more work to do all the entries under "by date."

Finally, I found an anomaly today.  I have a day in my .worklog that looks like

 2006-06-08 08:35 login
 2006-06-08 08:35 task1
 2006-06-08 10:17 stop
 2006-06-08 13:30 task2
 2006-06-08 15:30 stop   
 2006-06-08 21:03 task1
 2006-06-08 22:19 stop
 2006-06-08 22:19 logout

Unfortunately, the *worklog_summary* page section looks like

 2006-06-08
  2.58	task1

I noticed it, because I added task2 today manually, and it didn't increment the overall sum for task2.  I have this problem with version 2.3 and 2.4.1.  If you see what could be causing this and fix it, I'd be really grateful.
