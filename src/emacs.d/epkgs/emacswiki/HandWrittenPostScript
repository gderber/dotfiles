Using `M-x handwrite' you can turn the buffer into "handwritten" Postscript.

Postscript can be edited and printed from Emacs.  This is handy for
people using NT Emacs -- just use M-x ps-print-buffer (or M-x
ps-print-buffer-with-faces).

If you don't want to print colors, or if colors look bad on your
printer (too light, for example), you can use ps-extend-face to fix
that.  Here's an example of some old code I used while I was working
with NT Emacs with a dark barkground and light fonts:

   (ps-extend-face '(font-lock-keyword-face "black" nil bold) 'MERGE)
   (ps-extend-face '(font-lock-function-name-face "black" nil bold) 'MERGE)
   (ps-extend-face '(font-lock-keyword-face "black" nil bold) 'MERGE)
   (ps-extend-face '(font-lock-comment-face "dim gray" nil italic) 'MERGE)
