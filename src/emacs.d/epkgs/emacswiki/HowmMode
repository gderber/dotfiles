Howm allows you to take notes fragmentarily and browse them collectively.
It has hyperlinks and full-text search like EmacsWikiMode.
It is a minor mode and can be combined with other modes.

* http://howm.sourceforge.jp/

There is no distinction between pages - each record can be arbitrarily
timestamped, hyperlinked, and displayed with other related pages in
one buffer, if needed. Quite convenient if one wants what did he put
in about X, and next day - what was marked as Y. Very practical tool
for organizing notes into ad-hoc searchable ontology.

The interesting thing about this mode is that it doesn't only have
"normal" forward pointing links -- it also has backwards pointing
links:

'''Goto link''': These can point to keywords or to filenames.

      >>> ~/BabyloniaWave.txt
      >>> highway planet

'''Come-from link''': These can point "from" keywords.

      <<< crystal star cluster

The string 'crystal star cluster' in all other files will now automatically point here.

Todo and Notifiers are created as you type and displayed in a separate buffer according to the importance, so you can click and see the context of the appontment. 


''The format is as follows:''

[YYYY-MM-DD]- sink after the date (reminder)

[YYYY-MM-DD]+ float after the date (todo)

[YYYY-MM-DD]! float until the date (deadline)

As for recurring scheduled tasks, you can simply list them :-)
<pre>
      [2005-06-13]@ hogehoge
      [2005-06-20]@ hogehoge
      [2005-06-27]@ hogehoge
      [2005-07-04]@ hogehoge
</pre>
A method to input such lists is described in http://howm.sourceforge.jp/README.html.

: Thanks to SebastianBlatt for this question; it was not documented in English.
I am lazy and tend to leave problems until someone gives comments. --khi

: That's pretty convenient, thanks! One more question, though: is it possible to get howm to query the diary file or abuse diary-lib (diary-mode supports cyclic tasks and also has a nice entry format to specify e.g. the third Monday of August), so that I wouldn't have to enter holidays by hand every year? ...yes, I know I'm lazy. :-) --SebastianBlatt

Some codes to integrate howm and diary are found in
http://www.bookshelf.jp/cgi-bin/goto.cgi?file=meadow&node=howm%20calendar
(Please search the word "mark-calendar" in this page).
I expect everyone can read elisp part at least.

''To simplify things for others, I've pasted the code at HowmAndCalendar.'' --DavidOtoole

These codes provide the below features.

(calendar to howm)
* If you write "%hdiary" in your menu file ~/howm/0000-00-00-000000.howm, schedule from diary is shown in howm menu by "C-c , ,".
* M-x calendar, move TextCursor to a certain date, and type "d" to search that date in howm notes.

(howm to calendar)
* Dates for tasks in howm notes are highlighted in calendar.
* Type "d" in howm menu to open calendar.

I have a question: is it possible to show and maybe highlight "missed" appointments in the Schedule section? That is, appointments of the form "[date]@ text" that were not explicitly finished by hitting RET on the "@"? --SebastianBlatt

This should work. --[[khi]]
<pre>
    ;; show schedule items in menu...
    (setq howm-menu-schedule-days-before (* 365 30)) ;; from (today - X days)
    (setq howm-menu-schedule-days 7) ;; to (today + Y days)
</pre>

Highlighting is not available at now. How about "separators" instead?
* Write %reminder instead of %schedule and %todo in menu file 0000-00-00-000000.howm. Both appointments and todo items are shown in an unified form. (experimental hidden feature)
* Set separator lines as you like.
<pre>
    (setq howm-menu-reminder-separators
          '(
            ;; missed
            (-1  . "----------- m -----------------")
            ;; today
            (0   . "----------- 0 -----------------")
            ;; 1-3 days
            (3   . "----------- 3 -----------------")
            ;; 3-7 days
            (nil . "----------- t -----------------")
            ;; todo
            ))
</pre>

== Discussion ==

[new] Is there any way to have "templates" in howm ? I mean, I'd like
to create all my notes and put them in a "inbox" category (goto-link)
so that I could review them easily at each end of day ?
Also, is there any possibility exclude certain tags when searching for
notes ? -- XavierMaillard

Yes. Please read docstring of the variable `howm-template'.
You can exclude certain notes by typing C-u f contents RET
or C-u f summary RET in *howmS* buffer. -- [[khi]]

[new:XavierMaillard:2008-10-26 18:35 UTC]
Yes, I have seen it after having asked it here ... -- [[XavierMaillard]]
----


I already have a directory of notes. Can howm-mode take it from there ? [[ychaouche]]

[[ychaouche]]

Answere from [[khi]]:

<pre>
; howm-mode :)
;; search other directories in addition to `howm-directory'.
(setq howm-search-path '("/path/to/notes/directory" "/path/to/other/notes/directory"))
(setq howm-search-other-dir t)
</pre>
