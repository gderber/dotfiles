This works on Windows, because Winamp works on Windows.
If you do not use Winamp3, then the filename to look 
for in the tasklist is different.  Change the winamp
function as appropriate.

<pre>
    (defun winamp ()
      "Print what winamp is playing."
      (interactive)
      (let ((str (shell-command-to-string "c://WINDOWS/system32/tasklist.exe /v")))
	(when (string-match "^studio.exe.*?[0-9]+\\. \\(.*?\\)[ \t]*$" str)
	  (match-string 1 str))))

    (defun erc-cmd-WINAMP (&rest ignore)
      "Post what Winamp is playing." 
       (interactive)
      (erc-send-message (concat "NP: " (winamp))))
</pre>

Alternate regexp for winamp2 users: "^winamp.exe.*?[0-9]+\\. \\(.*?\\)[ \t]*\\((playing)\\)?\\(- winamp\\)?[ \t]*\r?$"

The second function makes a /WINAMP command available in ERC, such that you will send to the current channel what you are listening to right now, according to the window title.

Here are some modifications to the script to get better output with Windows and Winamp5.

<pre>
(defun winamp ()
      "Print what winamp is playing."
      (interactive)
      (let 
((str (shell-command-to-string "c://WINDOWS/system32/tasklist.exe /v")))
	(when (string-match "^winamp.exe.*?[0-9]+\\. \\(.*?\\)[ \t]*$" str)
	  (match-string 1 str))))

    (defun erc-cmd-WINAMP (&rest ignore)
      "Post what Winamp is playing." 
       (interactive)
      (erc-send-message (substring(concat "np: " (winamp)) 0
      (- (length(winamp)) 5))))
</pre>
