 ;;; Commentary:

 ;; The function `hide-region-hide' hides the region. You can hide many
 ;; different regions and they will be "marked" by two configurable
 ;; strings (so that you know where the hidden text is).

 ;; The hidden regions is pushed on a kind of hide-region "ring".

 ;; The function `hide-region-unhide' "unhides" one region, starting
 ;; with the last one you hid.

 ;; The best is to try it out.

Get the code here: Lisp:hide-region.el

I added [[http://github.com/chrisdone/hide-region/commit/d96532344572076f9fcf9297abb0f95a7861224d a patch for unhiding the region at the point]].  MathiasDahl's email (mathias.rem0veth1s.dahl@gmail.com) doesn't exist anymore, so maybe this is a reasonable place to notify him. -- ChrisDone

Woops. I just realised there's some nonsense ("rem0veth1s") in the email. Mathias, you use GMail! You don't need to do this! Anyway, I'll forward my email onto the correct address. -- ChrisDone

Thanks, Chris! ;) I think I stopped that nonsense some time ago after realizing GMail saves me most of the time ;) -- MaDa

I make an enhance of hide-region.el, named it [[hide-region+]], add three more functions:
1 hide-region-unhide-below
  unhide a region just below the point
2 hide-region-unhide-all
  unhide all the region in the current buffer
3 hide-region-toggle
  toggle all the gide region in the current buffer
