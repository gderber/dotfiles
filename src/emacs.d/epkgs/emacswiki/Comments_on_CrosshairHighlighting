The documentation does not say how to install and activate crosshairs.el on a standard .emacs init file.

@jonnymnemonic:
Good question.  Taking a quick look, the problem is in the vline.el code defining `vline-show'.  It seems to fix the problem if you do this:

* Change `##<##' to`##<=##' for the two tests in the `and' of the `while'.

* `let'-bind `done' to `nil' around the `while'.

* Change the `##(not (bobp))##' in the `and' of the `while' to `(not done)'.

* Add this as the first sexp after the `while' condition:

        (when (bobp) (setq done  t))

Give it a try.  Pound on it a bit.  If it seems right, send it to the `vline.el' author as a fix.  And let me know.  If you never hear back from the `vline.el' author then maybe I'll update the `vline.el' copy on the wiki, noting the change in a comment.  If my description of the fix is not clear, let me know.
