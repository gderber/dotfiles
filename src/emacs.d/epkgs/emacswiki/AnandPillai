I am a great emacs fan. I have been using emacs for my work since the
last 6 years. 

I have written a couple of scripts hosted on this site. 

* Lisp:cricket.el
* Lisp:extraedit.el

My homepage is hosted on fortunecity where I have some of my scripts/apps in python,
my other favorite programming language. 

* http://members.fortunecity.com/anandpillai

I dont chat on irc. I do on Yahoo! where my username is anandpillai6.

I am a software engineer with programming interests on C/C++/C#/Lisp/Python/.
I hope to turn into writing programming books one day.
