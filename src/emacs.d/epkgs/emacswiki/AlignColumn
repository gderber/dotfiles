You can align columns of text using align.el by MatthiasHelmling.  Get it here:

* Lisp:align.el

Put the file into your LoadPath and add the following code to your ~/.emacs file:

    (autoload 'align-cols "align" "Align text in the region." t)

Then use M-x align-cols to do it.

There is also a package called align.el provided with the emacs22 distribution, not to be confused with the previously described align.el.
See AlignCommands for more details.
