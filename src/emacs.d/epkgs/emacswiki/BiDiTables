The BiDiAlgorithm needs tables that classify characters according to
the bidi types used in the Unicode Tech Report, UAX#9.  These tables
use the bidi type classification from unicode.org, and it uses this
info for all the 8859 charsets.  This is in bidi-table.el -- about
500k.

* Lisp:bidi-table.el.gz

There is also a test table which only sets bidi types for ASCII
characters and which uses the bidi type R (like Hebrew and Arabic) for
capital letters.  This is great when tinkering with the code and when
writing test cases in plain ASCII.  This is in bidi-table-test.el --
about 5k.

* Lisp:bidi-table-test.el

The classification of characters in Emacs relies on Category tables.
In Emacs, these categories can be modified on the Lisp level.  Since I
didn't want to reserve any categories, I'm getting some unused
categories when bidi.el is loaded.  This seems not to work in XEmacs.
