I've been using emacs ever since I found it was a better choice than TECO. I also know how to use ed, and thus am only vaguely uncomfortable in vim or sed.

If you, gentle reader, have never used [[TECO]], then you really should hunt up some one of the many versions and try using it. You'll be ready for another beer in about ten minutes. How did [[rms]] and his buddies at [[IncompatibleTimeSharingSystem|its]] ever manage to use TECO? Well, it was better than patching paper tapes by hand, I guess.
