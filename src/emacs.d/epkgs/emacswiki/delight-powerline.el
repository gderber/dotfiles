;;; Example usage:
;;
;; ;; Configure delighted modes
;; (require 'delight)
;; (delight 'emacs-lisp-mode "eLisp" :major)
;;
;; ;; Enable powerline
;; (require 'powerline)
;; (require 'delight-powerline)
;; (powerline-default-theme)

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; With the exception of Emacsâ€™ default mode line rendering, anything
;; rendering a mode line construct will call `format-mode-line'. By
;; default, delight.el wants to display delighted major mode names
;; ONLY in the mode line and not elsewhere, and so delighted major
;; mode names are inhibited during calls to `format-mode-line'.
;;
;; Powerline, however, calls `format-mode-line' for the purpose of
;; replacing the standard mode line rendering, in which case we DO
;; want to see the delighted major mode names.
;;
;; As of version 1.04, delight.el respects the value of
;; `inhibit-mode-name-delight' if it has been bound by something else,
;; and so it is possible for other libraries/advice to let-bind this
;; variable (to `nil') around calls to `format-mode-line' in order
;; that the delighted value will be used for major modes.
;;
;; This library implements this behaviour for powerline specifically.

;;; Code:

(defadvice powerline-major-mode (around delight-powerline-major-mode activate)
  "Ensure that powerline's major mode names are delighted.

See `delight-major-mode'."
  (let ((inhibit-mode-name-delight nil))
    ad-do-it))

(provide 'delight-powerline)

;;; delight-powerline.el ends here
