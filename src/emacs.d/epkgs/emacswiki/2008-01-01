*Happy New Year!*
I was just reading through [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/85669 a thread on Emacs development] started by EricRaymond.
(Via PlanetEmacsen via [http://yrk.livejournal.com/208269.html an intro paragraph in a short post] by YoniRabkinKatzenell.)
Basically ESR was saying that Emacs development is suffering from weak leadership and old tools and that this is why Emacs is not gaining any new followers and developers amongst the young. The discussion is quite interesting and reminds me of older discussions we've had on emacs-devel in the past.

I also found the following gem which made my day:

: "I don't even use Emacs for anything anymore - just for farting around with Emacs
Lisp, an end in itself, a job I never want to get done." -- DrewAdams

Awesome. :D

;-).  FWIW, [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-01/msg00003.html check out the whole post], which is also my ''Happy New Year'' message to [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/ emacs-devel] and EmacsWiki. -- DrewAdams
