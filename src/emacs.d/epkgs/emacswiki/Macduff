I have been an Emacs user since 1985 and a member of the FSF since 2010.  I go by "Macduff" on [http://en.wikipedia.org Wikipedia] and elsewhere.

I've made some [[EmacsWallpaper#toc3|Emacs wallpapers]] and a couple other emacs-related graphics which may be found [http://www.churchofemacs.org/ here].
