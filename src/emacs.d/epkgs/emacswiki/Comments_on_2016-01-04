It seems like the logo (and perhaps other images) is not https-ed. This results in an tiny âš  sign in my browser.

Yeah, the logo is provided by the CSS and is not yet served from emacswiki.org.

Worse, however, is that I can't seem to answer the captcha (at least on my tablet) when using HTTPS. Presumably because reCAPTCHA needs an image served from elsewhere.
