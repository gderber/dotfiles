DwimCompile provides an alternative to the /compile/ command.

You can get the latest version here:

* https://github.com/cinsk/emacs-scripts/blob/master/src/dwim-compile.el

Some of its features are:

* Ability to detect build tools such as *maven*, *sbt*, *gradle*, then run them in the package root directory, not in the /default-directory/ of the current buffer.
* Ability to provide alternative functions or command-line depending on the /major-mode/.

Put something like this in your .emacs:

    (require 'dwim-compile)
    (global-set-key "\C-cc" 'dwim-c/compile)

Hope it will be useful -- CinSK.
