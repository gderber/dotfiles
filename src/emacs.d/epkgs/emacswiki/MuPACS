Is a mode to edit and interface the non-free computer algebra system MuPAD.  It
is available at [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mupacs MuPACS].

For those who are having trouble with the help, here is a code that
fixed it for me, just put it in your .emacs:

  (add-hook 'mupad-run-mode-hook (lambda ()
                                   (setq mupad-help-init-item-to-file nil)))
  (add-hook 'mupad-run-mode-hook (lambda ()
                                   (mupad-help-init)))
