I can use Super+Space to switch the input method. But what I typed is always English. I am using Arch.

When using IBUS 1.5+ you don't need to use an asian locale as stated on the page.  For instance I have LANG="en_GB.UTF-8" and it works perfectly.  You do, of course need the appropriate fonts installed.  There seem to be various advantages and disadvantages of the "new" method:

Advantages:  IBUS input works "the same" in emacs as in other applications.  I.e. you do not need to remember any emacs-only keys to swithch it on/off.

Disadvantages:
1) In ibus-mode, a separate connection to IBUS was made for each window in that mode.  This meant you could have different input method attached to different windows.  This is more than just a convenience, since you don't want, for instance, to be using a chinese input method in dired mode.  This means you have to remember to switch IBUS input methods when you are doing something other than inputting text using the latest IBUS.

2) There seems to be no easy way to change the cursor colour when swithching between IBUS input methods as you could in the old ibus-mode.

3) A lot of customization could be done to ibus-mode that is not now possible.

On the whole I prefer the "old" method.  However I now have various applications that require IBUS 1.5+ so it looks like I am stuck with the "new" method.
