Hi. I'm a Korean and Emacs newbie-about a half year old ;)- (as of 2006-06-24).

I recently found that some other Korean guy was writing wiki pages in Korean(translating). And I hope i can help.

Welcome to the wiki!  Thank you very much for working on translations.  The language barrier is very big if English is not your first language (my first language is German). -- AlexSchroeder

I'm now using imac '20 ... cooool.
