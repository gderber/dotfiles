Lisp:usage-memo.el

== Commentary: ==

This program enables you to write annotation in *Help* and
third-party help systems. When we do programming, we often use
Emacs help system (ie. describe-function). Do you want to take a
note in the *Help* buffer and want Emacs to show your note later?
In other words, integration of Emacs help and your memo!

Annotation files are stored below ~/memo/umemo by default. Its
subdirectories are categories. And their subdirectories are entry
annotation files. Because annotation files are read in each case,
you can generate annotation files automatically.

== Supported help systems: ==
<pre>
describe-function
describe-variable
slime-documentation (slime.el)
slime-describe-symbol (slime.el)
slime-describe-function (slime.el)
ri (ri-ruby.el)
lh-refe (langhelp / ReFe)
</pre>

usage-memo is general-purpose: it is easy to support other help systems.

If you support other help systems, add `define-usage-memo' sexps in
.emacs or redefine `umemo-initialize'.

== Usage: ==

* Switch to *Help*.
* Write your annotation below `===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===' line.
* Press C-x C-s to save annotation.
* Even if *Help* is killed or Emacs is restarted,
  your annotation is shown when you look up the same entry!!

This looks great, new user here ;).
Just one question: I think it would be useful, if this functionality could be extended 
to info pages. I have no insight into the interna of help and info, it could be very
simple or just impossible. ... So I just have to ask ;). -- [[Memnon_Anon]]

Sorry, it is impossible for now, because help-mode does not use printable chars for input, but info-mode uses them for navigation. Thank you for your feedback :). -- [[rubikitch]]
