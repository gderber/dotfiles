"Waiting for Emacs" would make for a scintillating piece of absurd
theater, with the particularly rememberable line "Code, pig!".  I have
not yet figured out where XEmacs would come into play, though.


ESTRAGON:
    Charming spot. (He turns, advances to front, halts facing
    auditorium .) Inspiring prospects. (He turns to Vladimir.) Let's
    release.

 
VLADIMIR:
    We can't.

 
ESTRAGON:
    Why not?

VLADIMIR:
    We're waiting for '''The Release'''.

 
ESTRAGON:
    (despairingly). Ah! (Pause.) You're sure it was here?

 
VLADIMIR:
    What?

 
ESTRAGON:
    That we were to wait.

 
VLADIMIR:
    He said from the trunk. (They look at the CVS tree.) Do you see any others?

 
ESTRAGON:
    What is it?
 
VLADIMIR:
    I don't know.  A branch.
 
ESTRAGON:
    Where are the commits?
 
VLADIMIR:
    It must be dead.
 
ESTRAGON:
    No more weeping.

VLADIMIR:
    Or perhaps it's not the season.

ESTRAGON:
    Nothing to be done...

DIDI:
    I've about come 'round to that opinion myself. All my life, I've put it from me, saying "Vladimir, be reasonable". And so I resumed the struggle.

ESTRAGON:
    '''''Let's go!'''''

DIDI:
    We can't.

ESTRAGON:
    Why ''not''?

DIDI:
    We're waiting for '''The Release'''.

ESTRAGON:
    Ahh...
