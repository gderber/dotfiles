This page is about different libraries and ways to ''switch buffers''. As always, you can click the title heading to list all pages related to buffer switching.

* SwitchingBuffers -- Discussion comparing the various packages.
* [[ControlTABbufferCycling]] -- methods which use or are similar to a most recently used stack of buffers, like MS Windows alt-tab

The following are specific tricks and packages for buffer switching.

* [[Anything]] -- can be used to switch to a buffer
* BufferMenu -- Like [[Dired]], but for buffers -- same thing as %%ListBuffers%%, but lets you also act on the buffers
* BufferMenuPlus -- %%BufferMenu%% and %%ListBuffers%% enhancements
* BufferQuickSwitcher -- Another way to switch buffers
* [[BufferRing]] -- simpler MTorus like rings
* BufferSelection -- %%BufferMenu%% alternative
* CategorizingInformationManager -- `ee-buffers' for buffer switching
* [[cOpenRelational]] -- keeping in touch between header file and source file for C or C++
* CycleBuffer -- switch to next/previous significant buffer
* DoReMi -- `doremi-buffers' (`C-x t b'): cycle among buffers
* EasyBufferSwitch -- A combination of number-indexed switch and cycle switch
* ElectricBufferList -- %%BufferMenu%% alternative
* FindHeaderFile -- open C/C++ header file on current line
* FindOtherFile -- GNU Emacs has this built-in capability for finding related files (e.g. C/C++ header files)
* FrameBufs -- %%BufferMenu%% and %%ListBuffers%% enhancements for frame-relative buffer lists
* IbufferMode -- %%BufferMenu%% alternative
* [[Icicles]] -- switch among buffers -- cycling and enhanced [[completion]].  Perform actions on selected buffers or sets of buffers.
* [[iflipb]] -- interactively flip between recently visited buffers
* InteractivelyDoThings -- Same as %%IswitchBuffers%%, for buffers, but also affects file access
* IswitchBuffers -- choose buffer without a menu (name-based)
* Lisp:contentswitch.el]] -- switch buffers by their content
* Lisp:jump-or-exec.el]] -- Jump to a buffer matched by buffer name, or call function when not found. See also [[http://sawfish.wikia.com/wiki/Jump-or-exec jump-or-exec from sawfish]].
* ListBuffers -- List buffers (default behavior for `C-x C-b')
* LustyExplorer -- Dynamic filesystem explorer and buffer switcher
* [[MTorus]] -- provides navigation on a discrete 2-torus of buffers
* PerWindowPoint --   Enable each window to remember and return to its value of point in each buffer it has displayed.
* [[PinBar]] -- create tabs at the top and switch associated buffers with a single stroke
* PointStack -- go back to places in buffers that you've marked
* [https://github.com/renard/quick-buffer-switch Quick Buffer Switch] -- Switch to buffer using intelligent predicates.
* RecreateScratchBuffer -- when ##*scratch*## disappears
* [[ShortList]] -- an efficient way to access a short list of buffers
* SwBuff -- another way to cycle among buffers
* TabBarMode -- buffer tabs
using arrow keys and/or mouse wheel
