'fol dingo' means in French "crazy mad" :)

This package was inspired by outline mode, folding.el (from Jamie
Lokier), tinyfold.el (Jari Aalto), foldout.el (Kevin Broadey).
Advantages with respect to other packages:
# Menu support
# Simple mouse behavior to open/close folds
# Programmable faces to identify open or closed folds
# Customizable identification of folds
        You may use explicit folds bounded by {{{ and }}}
        You may also have implicit folds depending on the mode (for 
        instance in Lisp- or C-based mode, long definitions are folded).

Keybindings are:
* C-c f e : (Re)Enter fold mode
* C-c f a : (Re)Enter fold mode and close all folds
* C-c f o : Open current fold
* C-c f h : Hide current fold
* C-c f f : Close all folds
* C-c f u : Open all folds
* [Queinnec] These were changed from Georg's definition
* C-c f i ; Open new fold
* C-c f w ; Insert a new fold (with open and close parts).
* C-c f c ; Close new fold

For TeX users:
I made my "tex-mode.el" override the keybindings for C-c f i and C-c f c with the according definitions for TeX. This way I usually got C(++) foldings and TeX foldings when in (La)TeX mode accessible via the keyboard.

Here is what you got to do if you want the same:

At the LaTeX keymap definition (in file "tex-mode.el")

<pre>
                    (defun tex-define-common-keys(keymap)...
</pre>

you insert the following two lines:
<pre>
            (define-key keymap "\C-cfi"   'insert-new-latex-fold)
            (define-key keymap "\C-cfc"   'close-latex-fold)
</pre>

then you append the following to the "tex-mode.el" (I put it just before the (run hooks...) statement:

<pre>
    (defun close-latex-fold ()
      "Closing a fold for LaTeX."
      (interactive "*")
      (if (not (bolp))
          (insert ?\n))
      (insert "%%}}}%%\n")
    )

    (defun insert-new-latex-fold (foldname)
      "Insert a new fold for LaTeX."
      (interactive "*sTitle of the new fold: ")
      (if (not (bolp))
          (insert ?\n))
      (insert (format "%%%%{{{  %s  %%%%\n"
                      foldname))
    )
</pre>

Now you byte-compile the "tex-mode.el" again and everything should work fine.

==Question(s)==
Quand le source dit : "Caution: this hook must be appended and not prepended
since fold-mode uses ^M characters and these characters may trigger some other hooks",
il faut comprendre quoi ? :) append, c'est mettre devant, mais devant quoi ?
(When the source says "Caution...", what am I supposed to understand ? :) append means put before,
but, before what ?). If a put this question here, it's 'cause I think I might not be the only one
not to understand (at least I hope so !) -- LucasBonnet

Such text usually refers to wether things get appended to the front or the end of a list.  See ListModification. -- AlexSchroeder

Is ''foldingo'' dead?  The above link points to a version that is about four years old.  Is ''folding'' the better way to go? -- DavidMasterson
