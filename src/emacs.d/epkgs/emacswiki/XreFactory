There is a GPL version labelled as "A C refactoring tool for emacs" at http://sourceforge.net/projects/c-xref/files/
All other references to the original Xrefactory seems to be gone...

[http://www.responsive.se/thomas/2014/08/30/xrefactory-to-c-xref-refactoring-c-with-emacs/ Here's] a write up of recent experience with it.

[old]
[http://www.xref-tech.com/xrefactory/main.html Xrefactory] is a tool for C and C++ providing code completion, source browsing and refactoring.

It is [http://www.xref-tech.com/xrefactory/license.html not Free Software].  Investigate a free RefactoringBrowser, instead. (Or read below...)

The older releases of Xrefactory that work with Emacs are "no-cost" (''gratis'') -- with the restriction that you are not allowed to resell the software.  Redistributions free of charge are allowed.  Attempts to encourage the owners to release the code under a free license have not had any results.  The C++ version has remained fully proprietary.

It seems very impressive, but does it deliver what it claims?

I used Xrefactory in my previous job, on a fairly large Java code
  base referencing many libraries.  It worked pretty well, especially
  the "semantic" tab completion and code navigation.  The C/Java
  version is now apparently free (used to be $29), but I don't know if
  it is still being updated (the downloadable version does not support
  newer JDKs). --Damien Diederen

These products (xrefactory c/java, xrefactory c++) seems to be abandoned. The c++ version does not work very well with recent c++ code (like one found in new versions of boost).

Vittek (where and whoever he is) release a C/Java version into GPL in 2006 on Sourceforge. I've tried to revive this excellent tool, but could really use some help as the code is in poor shape and it's an entangled web of legacy code ;-)

Fully working version for C and Java is on [http:/github.com/thoni56/c-xrefactory GitHub]. Also available as an el-get package for easy installation.
