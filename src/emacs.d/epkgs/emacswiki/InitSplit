initsplit.el splits out certain customization variables (defined via a regexp)
into their own files.  I use it to split out my JDE settings; the
remainder of my customizations work across my three machines, but the
JDE stuff is highly machine-specific.  Oh, and as a by-product,
customization variables are sorted in alphabetical order.

This package was written by JohnWiegley, and is now being maintained by
