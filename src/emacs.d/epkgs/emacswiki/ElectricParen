Watching Lisp Machine demo videos on Youtube, I observed that, in the REPL, complete expressions are evaluated as soon as the closing parenthesis is typed. There is no need to also type a carriage return. I wanted my Emacs to do this as well.

To that end, I made electric-paren:

Lisp:electric-paren.el

It works in the slime REPL, ielm, interactive lisp mode, and eshell. You can enable it like so:

<pre>
(require 'electric-paren)
(electric-paren-enable)
</pre>
