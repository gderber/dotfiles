Welcome to the wiki, where dreams of Emacs never end... 8-)
I must have missed your page when you created it so long ago.
Your homepage reminded me of the fact that my girlfriend was
very interested in learning some Santería dances here in Zürich
when she came back from a four week Cuba holiday off the official
tracks... -- AlexSchroeder

Hey Alex, this is pretty cool. I'm happy my strange database of 
voodoo incantations is useful for someone else.
Sometimes I still wonder how I got into this myself. 
I got into Emacs thanks to sitting next to Stefan Monnier 
and Dominik Madon at EPFL... thanks Stef and Dom! 
You changed my life forever.
Thanks for setting up this amazing Wiki, it is such a great 
resource, I love it I love it I love it.
Allright, bisous, --MartinBlais
