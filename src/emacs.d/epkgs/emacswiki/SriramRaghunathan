Was introduced to Emacs during 2010 by, [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AnilNarayanan|aniline]]. May be my day of enlightening happened then. 

Born in those switching period of Analog computer scientists and people who believe 'apple' is awesome. Managed to stay sane till today. 

Use Emacs extensively @ work , home, phone where ever i could.  Read my mail's, reply my mails, Open PDF, run gdb, org-mode, dired mode, ibuffer. [Emacs for all]. 

Want to try compiling ffmpeg with emacs and run ffmpeg-play-video interactive.  Small time experimenter with elisp and common lisp at times. Love the way ifile is written, Hang out at times on #emacs as sriramr. 

Debian user, have 3 machines running on debian right now, Mzombie, fulcrum1 and fulcrum2. 

'''ELisp Socket Code'''

<pre>
;;; Simple Tcp Sock 

(defvar listen-port 80)
(defvar listen-address "127.0.0.1")

(defun listen-start nil
  "Listen Start"
  (interactive)
  (make-network-process :name "listen" :buffer "*listen*" :family 'ipv4 :host listen-address :service listen-port :filter 'listen-filter :sentinel 'listen-sentinel))

(defun listen-filter(proc string)
  "Listen filter "
  (message string))

(defun listen-sentinel (proc msg)
  (when (string= msg "connection broken by remote peer\n")
    (message (format "client %s has quit" proc))))

(defun listen-stop nil 
  "Stop Emacs listen"
  (interactive)
  (delete-process "listen"))

(listen-start)
(sleep-for 10)
(listen-stop)
</pre>
