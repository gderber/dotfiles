= Space on Hyphen Discussion =
Does anyone know how to modify smex so that typing a space will insert a hyphen '-' like in normal M-x?
: Space already has the function of paging through the list of possible completions. But what's even better than typing a space is not typing anything; I see that in smex you can just type the function name as one word without hyphens, and it still works, including auto-completion. BTW, I think smex is very cool! -- ThomasKappler

: I disagree that not typing anything is better than typing a space. Commands often have a word-like structure, and the separation is important. So I'm adding my voice the the request for a way to restore the old functionality and have the space key insert a hyphen.

: This issue is not specific to Smex and a fix would benefit all Ido users. It will be addressed by the next Smex release.

: I did not mean to imply that the issue is specific to smex. Indeed, the same issue occurs when following the instructions to add [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings#toc5/ M-x support to ido]. Thanks for taking this on, it will really make it easier for me to use smex!

: I, too, want this effect, especially since omitting the hyphen seems to make the completion function do *alot* more work; i.e. when the next character in the command name is a hyphen and you omit the hyphen, there's a noticable lag as you type the rest of the characters in the name (try typing M-x backward-delete-char-untabify). Here's an easy fix, though if there is only one match it will be completed instead of inserting a hyphen, which may well be a desirable thing:
{{{
      (defadvice smex (around space-inserts-hyphen activate compile)
        (let ((ido-cannot-complete-command 
               `(lambda ()
                  (interactive)
                  (if (string= " " (this-command-keys))
                      (insert ?-)
                    (funcall ,ido-cannot-complete-command)))))
          ad-do-it))
}}}
: To not have it complete if there's only one match, fset ##ido-complete-space## to that lambda form above, then fset it back after ##ad-do-it## (##flet## doesn't work for interactive functions).

/Wicked cool./ Is it inspired by this [http://www.vimeo.com/1013263 video]? :)

I wrote a function that will also test whether hyphen can be inserted when press space. See [https://github.com/doitian/ido-complete-space-or-hyphen ido-complete-space-or-hyphen].
