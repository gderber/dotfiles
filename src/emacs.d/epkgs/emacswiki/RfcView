<code>rfcview.el</code> is a groovy mode for viewing [[RFC]] documents, created by NeilVanDyke.  It fontifies headings, and hides the header and footers (which are designed for a line printer), to improve on-screen readability.

Get it from the author at

On a [[Debian]] system see DebianPackage:emacs-goodies-el.

There's a significantly enhanced version at

(which was contributed back but hasn't been used).
