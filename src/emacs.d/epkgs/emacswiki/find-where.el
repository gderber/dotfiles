;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Find where something is true.
;;
;;  Get or go to the next place where some predicate is satisfied.
;;
;;  But first, you don't really need this library! ;-)
;;
;;  In Emacs and Emacs Lisp there are multiple ways to find things.
;;  And in many cases it will be simpler or more efficient to use
;;  another way than to take advantage of this library.
;;
;;  What this library offers is some convenience sometimes, and a
;;  certain kind of generality: Specify what you want to find by a
;;  predicate.  The predicate is tested at successive places, forward
;;  or backward, until it is satisfied.
;;
;;  By default, the forward and backward movement is among buffer
;;  positions, in the usual sense.  And by default, each movement
;;  before testing is just one character.  This is the minimum
;;  movement needed to get past the current position (which is often
;;  the last place found).
;;
;;  Moving only one character and testing is obviously not very
;;  efficient, but it is all that can be done in the general case.
;;
;;  When you know a way to move farther before testing and to be sure
;;  there is no need to test closer, you can take advantage of that by
;;  providing for the appropriate movement in the predicate you
;;  provide or in optional forward and backward movement functions.
;;
;;  Clearly, this move-one-char-and-test approach is not the way to go
;;  for ordinary string searching.  Emacs uses an efficient,
;;  Boyer-Moore string-search algorithm (see
;;  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string-search_algorithm),
;;  which essentially moves forward in chunks that are as long as what
;;  your search string matches, rather than moving just a character at
;;  a time before each match attempt.
;;
;;  So if you want to search for a sequence of characters, just use
;;  `(re-)search-forward' or similar.  And if you need an additional
;;  test at a match position (e.g., check a text or overlay property)
;;  you can easily add that.  So forget about this library for
;;  ordinary buffer search.
;;
;;  Still, you might find this library convenient for some things,
;;  even in cases where there is an easy alternative.  The abstraction
;;  of defining a destination by a predicate that holds there can be
;;  helpful.
;;
;;  So just what does it mean to "find where something is true"?  Find
;;  what?  Well, the what is defined by your predicate.  What is
;;  found, that is, returned, is both the position (where) and
;;  whatever the predicate returns as a non-nil value.  For example,
;;  you can find a text THING, such as the next vector with 13
;;  elements, and have it returned along with its bounds (start and
;;  end positions).
;;  
;;  The library defines some general functions to find and return the
;;  next or previous where-plus-what, which you provide with a
;;  defining predicate.  And it defines corresponding commands to go
;;  to the next or previous such location.
;;
;;  The commands have names that start (after prefix `fw-') with
;;  `to-'.  The corresponding non-interactive functions generally have
;;  the same names without the `to-'.  For example, function
;;  `fw-next-where' returns the next position and data that satisfy a
;;  predicate, and command `fw-to-next-where' goes there.
;;
;;  By default, movement is to the start position of something, but
;;  really the where, in relation to its what, is up to you.  The
;;  default behavior is thus different from the standard Emacs
;;  `forward-THING' and `backward-THING' behavior, which moves just
;;  past the THING rather than just to it.
;;
;;  This default behavior applies to all functions provided here, not
;;  just to those (`fw-next-thing' etc.) that find buffer THINGs.  For
;;  THINGs, `find-where.el' requires library `thingatpt+.el', which
;;  uses and enhances standard library `thingatpt.el'.
;;
;;  When repeated, the commands reuse the same predicate as the last
;;  time (it is the value of variable `fw-last-pred'), but a plain
;;  prefix argument (`C-u') makes them prompt you for the predicate to
;;  use.  The predicate you enter must accept a buffer position (the
;;  position to test) as its first argument.
;;
;;  A typical use might check something about the character at (i.e.,
;;  after) that position.
;;
;;  The THING-related function `fw-next-thing' just uses
;;  `fw-next-where' with a predicate that tests whether the position
;;  is at the start of a THING, where being at the start also means
;;  that the previous buffer position is not on the same thing (not
;;  just the same type of thing).
;;
;;  For instance, if the THING type passed to `fw-next-thing' is
;;  `list' then it returns the start position of the next list (as
;;  well as the list text as a string and its end position).
;;
;;  When repeated, the THING commands reuse the same THING type as the
;;  last time (it is the value of variable `fw-last-thing'), but a
;;  plain prefix argument (`C-u') makes them prompt you for the THING
;;  type to use.
;;
;;  You can bind any of the commands defined here to keys, of course.
;;  But you can also easily define other commands that make use of
;;  them, and bind those commands to keys.
;;
;;  For example, here's a simple command that moves to the start of
;;  the next use of face `font-lock-doc-face':
;;
;;  (defun to-next-doc-face (n)
;;    "Move to next occurrence of `font-lock-doc-face'.
;;  With numeric prefix arg N, move to the Nth next occurrence."
;;    (interactive "p")
;;    (fw-to-next-where #'doc-face-start-p nil nil n))
;;
;;  where the predicate is defined like so:
;;
;;  (defun doc-face-start-p (position)
;;    "Return non-nil if char at POSITION starts `font-lock-doc-face'.
;;  That is, it has that face, and any char just before it does not."
;;    (and (eq (get-text-property position 'face) 'font-lock-doc-face)
;;         (or (= position (point-min))
;;             (not (eq (get-text-property (1- position) 'face)
;;                      'font-lock-doc-face)))))
;;
;;  Note the use here of two complementary tests within the predicate.
;;  The character at the tested position must pass the test (having
;;  property `font-lock-doc-face'), and the preceding char, if there
;;  is one, must NOT pass the test.  This means that
;;  `to-next-doc-face' finds the _first_ character that passes the
;;  test.  This is typical of a predicate used with `find-where.el'
;;  functions.
;;
;;  For this reason, you can use helper function `fw-test-start-p' to
;;  take care of that true-here-but-not-just-before-here logic.  It
;;  takes the position to test and a predicate as arguments.  The
;;  predicate must be true at the position and false just before the
;;  position, for `fw-test-start-p' to be true (return non-nil).
;;
;;  Using `fw-test-start-p', `doc-face-start-p' becomes just this:
;;
;;  (defun doc-face-start-p (position)
;;    "Return non-nil if char at POSITION starts `font-lock-doc-face'.
;;  That is, it has that face, and any char just before it does not."
;;    (fw-test-start-p position
;;                     (lambda ()
;;                       (eq (get-text-property (point) 'face)
;;                           'font-lock-doc-face))))
;;
;;  The predicate arg to `fw-to-next-where' can accept additional
;;  arguments, besides the position.  So you can use a predicate that
;;  accepts, as argument, the face to look for, as well as the
;;  position to test.  For example:
;;
;;  (defun face-start-p (position face)
;;    "Return non-nil if the character at POSITION starts FACE.
;;  That is, it has FACE, and any character just before it does not."
;;    (and (eq (get-text-property position 'face) face)
;;         (or (= position (point-min))
;;             (not (eq (get-text-property (1- position) 'face)
;;                      face)))))
;;
;;  Or simplified using `fw-test-start-p':
;;
;;  (defun face-start-p (position face)
;;    "Return non-nil if the character at POSITION starts FACE.
;;  That is, it has FACE, and any character just before it does not."
;;    (fw-test-start-p position
;;                     `(lambda ()
;;                        (eq (get-text-property (point) 'face)
;;                            ',face))))
;;
;;  (defvar last-face nil "Last face used by `to-next-face'.")
;;
;;  (defun to-next-face (arg)
;;    "Move to next text-property occurrence of face `last-face'.
;;  With plain `C-u', prompt for the face to assign to `last-face'.
;;  With numeric prefix arg N, move to the Nth next occurrence."
;;    (interactive "P")
;;    (if (or (consp arg)  (not last-face))
;;        (setq last-face  (read-face-name "Face: ")
;;              arg        1)
;;      (setq arg  (prefix-numeric-value arg)))
;;    (fw-to-next-where #'face-start-p nil (list last-face) arg))
;;
;;
;;  [Note: Text property `face' can actually have a list of faces as
;;   its value, so instead of using an `eq' text in those `*-start-p'
;;   functions a more realistic example would test for the particular
;;   face using both `eq' and `memq' (return true if either is true).]
;;
;;  Now recall that the way `fw-to-next-where' works by default is to
;;  move forward only one char and then test with the predicate.  This
;;  is not very efficient, but it is all that can be done, unless
;;  there is some way to move farther forward before testing and be
;;  sure there is no need to test closer.
;;
;;  In the case of testing for a given text property (or overlay
;;  property) at a buffer position there is such a better way: use
;;  function `next-single-property-change'.  Using that, we can define
;;  the forward-movement function `to-next-face-prop', which we can
;;  pass to `to-next-face' to override the default one-char movement
;;  (`forward-char').
;;
;;  (defun to-next-face-prop ()
;;    "Go to next change in `face' text property."
;;    (let ((pos  (next-single-property-change (point) 'face)))
;;      (when pos (goto-char pos))))
;;
;;  (defun to-next-face (arg)
;;    (interactive "P")
;;    (if (or (consp arg)  (not last-face))
;;        (setq last-face  (read-face-name "Face: ")
;;              arg        1)
;;      (setq arg  (prefix-numeric-value arg)))
;;    (fw-to-next-where #'face-start-p nil (list last-face) arg
;;                      nil nil nil #'to-next-face-prop))
;;
;;
;;  As an example of defining a next-THING command, this defines a
;;  command to move forward among sexps:
;;
;;  (defun to-next-sexp (n)
;;    "Go to next start of a sexp."
;;    (interactive "p")
;;    (fw-to-next-thing 'sexp nil n))
;;
;;  And this moves among strings:
;;
;;  (defun to-next-string (n)
;;    "Go to next start of a string."
;;    (interactive "p")
;;    (fw-to-next-thing 'string nil n))
;;
;;  Note that the various `fw-to-next-*' and `fw-to-previous-*'
;;  commands move to the _beginning_ of the next or previous place
;;  where something is true.  For example, if you use `fw-next-thing'
;;  with THING `word' then the cursor moves to the beginning of each
;;  word.  This is different from typical Emacs `forward-*' and
;;  `backward-*' commands, which move _past_ the end or the beginning
;;  of something.
;;
;;  Typical Emacs `forward-*' commands essentially perform the
;;  following sequence of actions, expressed in terms of `fw-next-*':
;;
;;    1. While some predicate PRED-X is NOT true, do `fw-to-next-X'.
;;    2. Do `fw-to-next-NOT-X'.
;;
;;  Step 1 moves to the next place X is true (e.g., a word beginning).
;;  Step 2 moves just past where X continues to be true (e.g., just
;;  after the end of the word).
;;
;;  Partly as a way of illustrating this, commands `fw-downward-word'
;;  and `fw-upward-word' act like Emacs `forward-word' and
;;  `backward-word', but they move through text vertically, not
;;  horizontally.  They are defined using steps 1 and 2.
;;
;;
;;  Commands defined here:
;;
;;    `fw-downward-word', `fw-to-column-down', `fw-to-column-up',
;;    `fw-to-next-thing', `fw-to-next-where',
;;    `fw-to-next-where-vertical', `fw-to-previous-thing',
;;    `fw-to-previous-where', `fw-to-previous-where-vertical',
