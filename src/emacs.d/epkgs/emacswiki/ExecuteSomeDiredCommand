The following executes a commands whose name contains `dired'.

{{{
(defun execute-extended-dired-command ()
  "Execute extended Dired command.
Same as `execute-extended-command' with the difference that only
command names matching the regexp \"dired\" are available.  This
is useful for commands that operate on files in Dired together
with `partial-completion-mode' as limiting the number of matching
commands makes it easier to find the relevant command.  For
example, typing e-p-d TAB at the M-x prompt would match four commands
on my system whereas this command only matches the one I want,
`emms-play-dired'."
  (interactive)
  (let (sym-list cmd)
    (mapatoms
       (lambda (sym)
         (if (and (string-match "dired" (symbol-name sym))
                  (commandp sym))
             (setq sym-list (cons (symbol-name sym) sym-list)))))
    (setq cmd (completing-read "Executed extended Dired command: " sym-list))
    (if cmd
        (call-interactively (intern cmd)))))
}}}

The binding I use:

 (define-key dired-mode-map "\M-d" 'execute-extended-dired-command)

-- MaDa

[[Smex]] includes the command 'smex-major-mode-commands' that generalizes this approach by applying the same routine to the currently active major-mode. When you are in dired-mode, it will present you with all commands relevant to Dired.
