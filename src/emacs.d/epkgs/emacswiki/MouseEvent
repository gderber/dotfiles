More compatibility code for Emacs vs XEmacs.  This time for mouse events.  The sample code is from IbufferMode.

<pre>
(cond ((fboundp 'posn-point)
       ;; Emacs
       (defun ibuffer-event-position (event)
	 (posn-point (event-start event))))
      ((or (featurep 'xemacs)
	   (string-match "XEmacs\\|Lucid" (emacs-version)))
       (defun ibuffer-event-position (event)
	 (event-point event)))
      (t
       (error "Couldn't make a suitable definition of `ibuffer-event-position'")))

(cond ((fboundp 'posn-window)
       ;; Emacs
       (defun ibuffer-event-window (event)
	 (posn-window (event-start event))))
      ((or (featurep 'xemacs)
	   (string-match "XEmacs\\|Lucid" (emacs-version)))
       (defun ibuffer-event-window (event)
	 (event-window event)))
      (t
       (error "Couldn't make a suitable definition of `ibuffer-event-window'")))
</pre>

This works for a click, but what is the XEmacs equivalent of (event-start event) on a drag event?
