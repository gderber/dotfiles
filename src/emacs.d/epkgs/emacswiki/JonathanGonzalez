Hi, 

I'm Jonthan Gonzalez know as [::zeus] at irc.freenode.net, you can
meet me at #emacs and #savannah channels.

=== Why do I use GNU Emacs? ===

I've started search for an IDE to write C programs but none of the
previous software help me as I want it because all of them use
complicated things like many clicks to do something and all of them
didn't let me do what I want it and customize what I want.

I started to use GNU Emacs and my IDEs problems get solved including
the main problem, customize the software that I use. One of the
biggest plus of use GNU Emacs was that I didn't need to change the IDE
one I changed the programming language, because Emacs can be an IDE
for many languages.


=== Emacs Related Projects ===

I'm currently creating a wiki on http://www.emacs.cl for spanish users
that want to learn use GNU Emacs.


I maintain http://emacswiki.emacs.cl a mirror of EmacsWiki (see [[Rsync repository]]).
