The problem is next. Suppose you are tired going from work to home,
get to the bus, paid for a ticket. There is a game which will shake
you a little. We have six digits is ticket number, our aim is put
"+","-","*" or "/" between any two digits, eval an expression and we
should get 100! If it were easy to find, try to find other solution.

Here is also how Emacs can play this game.

    (defvar bil-list nil "list of valid tickets.")
    
    (defun bil-calc (pbil pidx)
      "nil"
      (let ((idx pidx)
    	(sbil pbil))
        (condition-case nil
    	;; prevent division by zero
    	(when (string= (calc-eval sbil) "100")
    	  (add-to-list 'bil-list sbil))
          (error nil))
        (if (= idx (length sbil))
    	nil
          (mapcar (lambda (lid)
    		(mapcar (lambda (sign)
    			  (bil-calc (concat (substring sbil 0 lid) sign (substring sbil lid)) lid))
    			'("+" "-" "*" "/")))
    	      (let ((lix (+ idx 1)))
    		(mapcar (lambda (not-used) (setq lix (+ lix 1))) (make-list (- (length sbil) lix) nil)))))))
    
    (defun bil-findit (num)
      "Find play solution for number NUM."
      (progn
        (setq bil-list nil)
        (bil-calc num 0)
        bil-list))

    (bil-findit "168264")
