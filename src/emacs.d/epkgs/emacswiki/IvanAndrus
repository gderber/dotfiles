I use Emacs since 2003, initially for LaTeX.  Now I use it for all my text editing.

The wiki has been extremely useful to me many times, so thanks everyone.

I would like to see the ability to differentiate between mouse buttons in the tool-bar, and hopefully someday (when I'm smart) will create a patch to do so.

Welcome to the wiki!  :)  If this site helped to attract more people to Emacs development, that would be awesome. -- AlexSchroeder
