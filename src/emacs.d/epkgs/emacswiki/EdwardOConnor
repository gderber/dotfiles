Hi, I go by Ted in person and by [::hober] in most online contexts, such as the EmacsChannel.
I run PlanetEmacsen.

I've written several Elisp applications and libraries, including

* Various Web API clients
** LjUpdate, a [MeatBall:LiveJournal LiveJournal] posting tool.
** GoogleInterface
** BackpackClient
** TechnoratiClient
** FlickrClient
* color-theme-hober (included in ColorTheme) and [http://edward.oconnor.cx/elisp/color-theme-hober2.el color-theme-hober2].
* [http://edward.oconnor.cx/elisp/ And more.]

My Emacs configuration comes in several pieces:

* [http://edward.oconnor.cx/config/.emacs .emacs]
* [http://edward.oconnor.cx/config/.ercrc.el .ercrc.el]
* [http://edward.oconnor.cx/config/.gnus .gnus]
* [http://edward.oconnor.cx/config/.viper .viper]

You can read more about me on my [http://edward.oconnor.cx/ home page].
