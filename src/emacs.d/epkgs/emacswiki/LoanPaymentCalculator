This is some simple elisp I wrote.  All the work is in coding the loan payment formula into prefix notation.  --LathI
<pre>
(defun dka-loan-payment-calculator (amount rate years)
"Calculate what the payments for a loan of AMOUNT dollars when
annual percentage rate is RATE and the term of the loan is
YEARS years.  The RATE should expressed in terms of the percentage 
\(i.e. \'8.9\' instead of \'.089\'\).  The total amount of
interest charged over the life of the loan is also given."
  (interactive "nLoan Amount: \nnAPR: \nnTerm (years): ")
  (let ((payment (/ (* amount (/ rate 1200)) (- 1 (expt (+ 1 (/ rate 1200)) (* years -12.0))))))
	 (message "%s payments of $%.2f. Total interest $%.2f" 
                  (* years 12) payment (- (* payment years 12) amount))))
</pre>

Perhaps, all 1200's in the formula should be replaced by 1200.00's.  Otherwise, if someone entered an integer rate like 5, emacs will treat it as 0. -- [[deego]]
