ii-mode is an Emacs mode for handling files created by the small filesystem-based irc client by suckless [http://tools.suckless.org/ii/ ii]. 

The model of using Emacs for interfaces to external programs, rather than running them inside the elisp environment itself also seems more elegant.

This allows for a much more detached use of irc, not having to keep one buffer open for each channel, but still getting notified if someone pings you.
