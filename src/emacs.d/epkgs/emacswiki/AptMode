This mode allows easy running of Debian apt-related software from emacs. For the emacs addicts' eyes only!! :) 

You can find the package at:
 http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/software/apt-mode.html

I would like to collect a few ideas to improve this mode to get an real impressing reason for all the users not switched to emacs yet for crossing the lines... And therefor this page:

* What do you like in other frontends like dselect or aptitude?

: Reversed-dependencies, version specific selection and NCB (all from aptitude) -- AnonymousCoward

: I would like to surf through the search-buffer and install and remove interactively packages ... shouldn't be that hard, i will try that now! -- MarioDomgoergen

: I would like to mark and install packages in a way similar to ELPA -- ckoch786

* What for killer features were you always wishing for?

* Another ideas?

== Use with Anything ==
'''[[Anything]]''' is a candidate selection framework.

Start with `M-x anything-apt', narrow the list by typing some patterns(multiple patterns are space-delimited string),
select with up/down/pgup/pgdown/C-p/C-n/C-v/M-v, choose with enter,
With TAB actions can be selected if the selected package has more than one possible action.
With C-z description of selected package is displayed without quitting anything session.
