== About Me ==

I am a trapeese artist performing in the London Special Circus, I have
done this my whole life. I was home educated by my mother who is the
resident bearded lady, she is as clever as she is hairy but despite
this, qualification-wise, I have only one GCSE (in wood work). But I
say it's the university of life where you really learn (and possibly
real schools where my friends really learned).

I met emacs when I was working on a way to collate statistics
generated by the carnie that runs the throwing stall. None of my
fellow circus performers really understand what I see in the one true
editor, infact, Finger Billy - the boy with 16 fingers, thinks I'm a
freak for liking it so much. He might be right but I can't afford the
more expensive editors on my wage.
