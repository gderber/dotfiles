== Introduction ==
Tabbar ruler is an emacs package that allows both the tabbar and the
ruler to be used together.  In addition it allows auto-hiding of the
menu-bar and tool-bar.


Tabbar appearance based on reverse engineering Aquaemacs code and
changing to my preferences, and Emacs Wiki.

Tabbar/Ruler integration is new. Tabbar should be active on mouse
move.  Ruler should be active on self-insert commands.

Also allows auto-hiding of toolbar and menu.

To use this, put the library in your load path and use

{{{
  (setq tabbar-ruler-global-tabbar t) ; If you want tabbar
  (setq tabbar-ruler-global-ruler t) ; if you want a global ruler
  (setq tabbar-ruler-popup-menu t) ; If you want a popup menu.
  (setq tabbar-ruler-popup-toolbar t) ; If you want a popup toolbar
  (setq tabbar-ruler-popup-scrollbar t) ; If you want to only show the
                                        ; scroll bar when your mouse is moving.
  (require 'tabbar-ruler)

}}}


== Changing how tabbar groups files/buffers ==
The default behavior for tabbar-ruler is to group the tabs by frame.
You can change this back to the old-behavior by:
{{{
  (tabbar-ruler-group-buffer-groups)
}}}
or by issuing the following code:

{{{
  (setq tabbar-buffer-groups-function 'tabbar-buffer-groups)
}}}

In addition, you can also group by projectile project easily by:

{{{
  (tabbar-ruler-group-by-projectile-project)
}}}
== Adding key-bindings to tabbar-ruler ==
You can add key-bindings to change the current tab.  The easiest way
to add the bindings is to add a key like:

{{{
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c t") 'tabbar-ruler-move)
}}}

After that, all you would need to press is Control+c t and then the
arrow keys will allow you to change the buffer quite easily.  To exit
the buffer movement you can press enter or space.

== Known issues ==
the left arrow is text instead of an image.

Fidler Last-Updated: Sat Dec 15 15:44:34 2012 (+0800) #663 (Matthew L. Fidler) Fixed speed issues on windows. It wasn't a redraw that was causing the speed issues, it was the constant recreation of the right-click menus...  (Matthew L. Fidler)
* <b>27-Mar-2013 </b> --   Fixed typo to fix issue #2. (Matthew L. Fidler)
* <b>27-Mar-2013 </b> --   Attempt to fix issue #2. Whenever the color is not a string, assume that it should be transparent. I'm unsure if the mac osx puts the translated color to a string. However, it seems that the undefined should be the same as transparent. Therefore, this fix *should* work... (Matthew L. Fidler)
