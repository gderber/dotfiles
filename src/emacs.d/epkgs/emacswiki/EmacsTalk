The simplest of all chat clients.  All you need to know is the X
display of your partner.  M-x talk-connect will create a frame on the
other display.  You need to trust each other, and probably you need to
fiddle with the xauth program or whatever authorization method your X
server is using, in order to allow your partner to create a frame on
your display.
