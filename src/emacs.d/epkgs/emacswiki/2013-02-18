Anybody interested in Bootstrap and JQuery and everything else that is new and fancy (says the old fart using Perl)... Have a look at [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-test/?css= Emacs Wiki using a Bootstrap config file].

This is probably incompatible with any [[CSS]] you might be using.

It looks more and more likely that Emacs Wiki will eventually switch to the new look and feel.Thus, now's the time to use http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-test/?css= and figure out what works and what doesn't. Let me know what you think, either by leaving a comment here or by sending me an email.

Please tell us how to get back to the current default appearance and cookie state, IOW, how to completely undo (cleanly) the effect of that clicking that link will have.  Then I will try it out and offer feedback.

Also, please let us know how, after you make the change, to get back to the effect of the current (now) default appearance, in case we prefer it.  Thx. -- DrewAdams

Simply getting rid of the "-test" switches you back to the old look and feel:
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?css=

Later, once the switch is done, I'm sure we can provide the old look with a different script or cookie setting. I just haven't decided on the details,yet.

Thanks.  Here's my feedback, FWIW.

I prefer the current to the new.

1. The text is easier to read: darker, with serifs, etc.

2. The pages are narrower.  I use a portrait-shaped browser window, and I don't want to have to either make it wider (losing screen real estate) or horizontally scroll.

So I, for one (perhaps to remain a minority of one), will choose what is now the current default appearance, after you make the change.

Thanks for the feedback. As for myself, I find the font-size too small for my iPhone. -- Alex

[new:DrewAdams:2013-03-10 17:22 UTC]
The font size is big, but the font is light-lined and without serifs, which is not ideal for reading text.  Dunno whether that pertains to mobile devices, however.  Clearly it is good to have multiple renderings, to let users choose.  I don't mind choosing a non-default look (e.g., what is currently the default). -- DrewAdams

I'm looking forward to this.  I'll play with it in my Samsung Galaxy handheld.  The only thing disruptive is the zero-margin.  I'd suggest the following [[CSS]] change: ##body { margin: 1em; }##. -- AaronHawley
