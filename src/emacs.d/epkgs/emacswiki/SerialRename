This little code provide a way to rename file sequentially and safely.

To sort the files correctly, you have to set start to 101 if you have a set of files
bigger than 100.

This code is part of Lisp:thumb-page.el

<pre>
;;rename all files of rep matching ext sequentially
 
(defun tv-serial-rename (dir ext name start)
  "Rename sequentially a set of file with the extension ext 
in a repertory dir with the name name + the startnumber start"
  (interactive "fDir: \nsExt(no dot): \nsName: \nnStart: ")
  (find-file dir)
  (let (ls-dir
	new-ls-dir
	n
	c)
  (setq ls-dir (file-expand-wildcards (format "*.%s" ext) t))
  (setq new-ls-dir nil)
  (setq n 0)
  (while (< n (length ls-dir))
    (if (< start 10)
	(push (concat dir name (format "0%s" start) "." ext) new-ls-dir)
      (push (concat dir name (format "%s" start) "." ext) new-ls-dir))
    (setq start (+ start 1))
    (setq n (+ n 1)))
  (setq ls-dir (reverse ls-dir))
  (setq c 0)
  (dolist (i ls-dir)
    (rename-file i (nth c new-ls-dir))
    (setq c (+ c 1)))))
</pre>
