Very nice package!!
I use bm.el much more frequently than standard bookmark.el. -- [[rubikitch]]

I have written an extension for this that adds a listing of all bookmarks in all buffers. See here: [[bm-ext.el]]  -- DanMcKinley

ATM, bm.el contains `bm-show-all' and claims to since version 1.34 -- there is even acknowledgement of DanMcKinley's work from [[bm-ext.el]].  AFAICT, [[bm-ext.el]] is no longer necessary from a functional perspective. -- Anonymous

If you want to be able to toggle bookmarks by clicking in the fringe, this works for me:
<pre>
(global-set-key (kbd "<left-fringe> <mouse-1>") #'(lambda(event)
                                                    (interactive "e")
                                                    (save-excursion
                                                      (mouse-set-point event)
                                                      (bm-toggle))))
</pre>

* [[Anything]] -- `M-x anything-bm-list'
* [[BookmarkPlus#HighlightingBookmarkLocations|Bookmark+]] -- Similar %%VisualStudio%%-like behavior.  Visible bookmarks that also function as normal (standard) bookmarks.  Cycle, highlight in various ways.  A bookmark can be, but need not be, highlighted.  It can be temporary or persistent.
