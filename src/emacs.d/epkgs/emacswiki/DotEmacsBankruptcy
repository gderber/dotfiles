When your InitFile gets so large that you really need to start over, then you have declared ".emacs bankruptcy".

The term was coined by RyanMcGeary on 2007-10-07[http://www.emacsblog.org/2007/10/07/declaring-emacs-bankruptcy/]:

: ''I give up. During the past 6 years of my emacs career, my .emacs initialization file grew to embarrassing levels. As of this morning, it is well over 1000 lines and is a looming burden of disorganization. Startup time is poor, customizations exist for modes that I donâ€™t use anymore (ahem, csharp-mode), and it has been this way for too long....''

:: For configuration code related to rarely or no longer used modes, you can move the code into eval-after-load forms to reduce emacs startup time. -- [[JisangYoo]]
