Hi , I absolutely love sr-speedbar, I just have one issue which I can't fix myself and hope that you can help me on this. sr-speedbar doesn't wrap long directory paths like speedbar does when it's in it own frame. Is there some way to achieve this behavior in sr-speedbar ? 
Thanks

Silly question (feel free to delete if useless). 

The elpa / melpa package seems to be broken ; when I install this :

sr-speedbar        20140608.... available  melpa      Same frame speedbar

Calling sr-speedbar-open results in :

Symbol's function definition is void: sr-speedbar-handle-other-window-advice

Where should i report this ?

I have files of extensions that are not *.c or *.h which are not getting listed in sr-speedbar. How to work around that ?

I think following code looks like wired to me.
< sr-speedbar.el >

(defun sr-speedbar-open
...
          (if (<= (sr-speedbar-current-window-take-width) sr-speedbar-width)
              (setq sr-speedbar-width sr-speedbar-default-width))
...

In my opinion this code should be
          (if (>= (sr-speedbar-current-window-take-width) sr-speedbar-width)
              (setq sr-speedbar-width sr-speedbar-default-width))
---------------------- (please focus on 'inequality operator' ---------------------------
Am I missing something???
