Unbalanced parentheses will cause errors in elisp files when they are loaded.

As of GNU Emacs 21.1, the command `check-parens' checks
for unbalanced parentheses automagically.
Without it, use C-M-f and C-M-b across [[Sexps]].
These include balanced parentheses, so when it fails, you know you
have reached the problematic spot.

If you're editing emacs-lisp code, why not turn on check-parens on a save? Here's the highly uncustomizable code to do it. Note that it will not let you save until you correct the error, which maybe not good for your situation.

 ; could be bad, will not let you save at all, until you correct the error
 (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
  (function (lambda ()
   (add-hook 'local-write-file-hooks 
    'check-parens))))
