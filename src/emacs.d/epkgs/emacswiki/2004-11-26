I installed a text formatting rule for IRC logs.

<foo> bar
<fuz> baz

It probably needs some more attention.  Let's give it a try for the moment and see how it goes.

I also installed a despamming module that will revert all pages to the last unspammed version.
If you're one of the EmacsWikiAdministrators, you just need to add the regular expressions to BannedContent,
and run the despam action, without having to manually revert all the spam.

And I changed the code responsible for rollbacks.  Now (2004-11-27) it should rollback pages
as minor or major changes, depending on what type the rolledback changes are: If only minor
changes are being rolled back, the rollback is a minor change as well.
