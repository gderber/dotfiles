: Only about three people have checked parts of the Lisp manual,
and only about five chapters have been checked.  We can't publish
a new edition without more checking.  Please start helping.
If you figure someone else will do it, probably it won't get done.

See http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/emacs/emacs/man/ for the
texinfo files to check.
