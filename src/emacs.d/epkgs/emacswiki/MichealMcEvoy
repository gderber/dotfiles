I use Emacs.  I have been using Emacs since I installed Linux rel0.9p13.  I am a free-lance hacker, who uses Perl.  I am learning Lisp, why it's taken this long to start, I haven't a clue.

2010.03.10 - Moved back to Madison, Wisconsin.  Since I can't seem to find work, I'm going back to school to hone my network and IDS/IPS skills.

Welcome to the wiki! :) Don't worry, it took me a long time as well before getting started with EmacsLisp. -- AlexSchroeder
