== Introduction ==

It's a very simple mode however it does what I need it to. First, it takes something like:

    HL*239*aoeunth*2389~JH*oetuhn*oenuh~DAT*John Smith*8293828*19439283~

and converts it to a line-by-line format (what I call readable) [<code>C-c C-r</code>]

    HL*239*aoeunth*2389~
    JH*oetuhn*oenuh~
    DAT*John Smith*8293828*19439283~

Secondly, the HL, HL2 and DAT segment names would then be highlighted to make it easier to see where you are in the file.

Thirdly, it provides a count segment function. When working with EDI files, I often had missing segments, or too many segments. This count function came in very handy. [<code>C-c C-c</code>]

Finally, you can convert a readable EDI file (line-by-line) back into a standard EDI file (everything on 1 line, regardless of size). [<code>C-c C-e</code>]

== Missing Features ==

* How about different separating chars? It should be configurable
* How about escaping char? It should be configurable
