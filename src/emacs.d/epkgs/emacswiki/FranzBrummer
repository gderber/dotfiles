New Emacs user. 

Actually convert... No don't ask! ;-)

I just started out on using Emacs. I will try to use it for as many things as possible on Windows (at work) and on Linux (home).

My primary interest is in programming with Emacs. If I can find some time I will try to learn Emacs Lisp for being able to better customize this amazing editor (no it is so much more...).

: Welcome to the wiki!  I've been using Emacs both at home (GNU/Linux, politically correct, haha) and at work (Windows) for years, now.  Great stuff. -- AlexSchroeder
