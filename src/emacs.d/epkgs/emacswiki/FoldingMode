== Description ==

Folding mode is a MinorMode that uses a special string to find the regions to hide:
<nowiki>{{{ and }}}</nowiki>.
The variable <code>fold-mode-marks-alist</code> defines the strings for each MajorMode separately.
From the folding menu you can enter, show, hide, etc. regions. With the Mouse-3 (the rightmost mouse button) when there is no other context menu defined a right mouse click will toggle the visibility of fold.

Folding mode was originally written by [[JamieLokier|Jamie Lokier]] and later extended by [[JariAalto|Jari Aalto]] and [[AndersLindgren|Anders Lindgren]].

== Install ==

Add the following to your ~/.emacs InitFile and then every opened file
will be searched for folding marks:

  (load "folding" 'nomessage 'noerror)
  (folding-mode-add-find-file-hook)

Folding mode is based on comments, and it uses the
<code>folding-top-mark</code> and <code>folding-bottom-mark</code> to
distinguish which region should be folded.

== Example of How to Use it with Ruby ==

After adding those two lines above, also add:

  (folding-add-to-marks-list 'ruby-mode "#{{{" "#}}}" nil t)

Now say you have some ruby code you want to make foldable. Wrap it in #{{{ #}}} thus:

  # this code does blah
  #{{{
  def blah
    do some blah
    do some more blah
  end
  #}}}

Remember to M-x folding-mode <RET> to enable FoldingMode.
Now, anywhere within those boundaries you can do C-c @ C-q to toggle it open and closed.


== Caveats ==

Always make sure that you have a closing fold mark for every opening mark! Otherwise the opening of files might be difficult.  Using <code>M-x occur</code> to search for opening and closing marks is a good idea for this.

To set own folding marks for a given mode, study the following example.

  (folding-add-to-marks-list 'php-mode                "//{"  "//}"  nil t)
  (folding-add-to-marks-list 'prolog-mode             "%{{{" "%}}}" nil t)
  (folding-add-to-marks-list 'html-mode               "<!-- {{{ " "<!-- }}} -->" " -->" nil t)

Note: In plain text mode the symbol for open fold is "{{{ " (that is, with a space at the end).

== An example - Folding Mode for C Code ==

While editing C programs, folding-mode use '/* {{{ ' and '/* }}}' as
the top and bottom mark. And it is easy for you to use the interactive
function <code>fold-fold-region</code> to fold a region marked by
Emacs set-mark. If you want a many level folded file, you have to do
nothing but to fold a region in a folded region like this:

     /* {{{ This is the parent level */
     main()
     {
	/* {{{ This is the first child level (var initialized) */
	int i,j,k;
	float l,m,n;
	char a,b,c;
	/* }}} child level ended */

	/* {{{ Here is the second child level (function) */

	/* {{{ grand-son level (function used to get character) */
	char getChar()
	{
	    ...
	}
	/* }}} grand-son level ended */

	int getInt()
	{
	    ...
	}

	float getFloat()
	{
	    ...
	}
	/* }}} second child level ended */

	/* and so on */
	 ...
	/* }}} */
    }

After folding this buffer in Emacs, it looks like that:

  /* {{{ This is the parent level ...

When you use enter this level, you will see:

  /* {{{ This is the first child level ...
  /* {{{ Here is the second child level ...
  /* {{{ and so on ...

'''Note:''' Actually, <code>hs-minor-mode</code> which comes with Emacs CVS (as of May 25th 2003) <b>does</b> work like this, hiding only the first containing block. I guess it also works correctly with "older" Emacs 21.2 and 21.3.

== Ideas ==

Michael Grasso suggested ##`C-u 2 C-x $'## (##`C-x $'## to clear), see Groups:folding&selm=199312202324.AA16992@macchi.lochard.com.au

See also HideShow.

If you want to see how you can use FoldingMode to organize your file you might consider Lisp:eukleides.el and Lisp:moikrug.el as examples.

== Notes ==

[new]
Both 2.107 and the older 2.99 appear to work perfectly with my GNU Emacs CVS. -- TimAnderson
[new]
The folding.el (version: 2.117+) from the XEmacs CVS does not appear to be working on my GNU Emacs 22.0.55.1 -- RudiGrinberg
[new]
I found folding-mode is not compatiable with GNU Emacs 22.0.50.1. The newlines of file save with folding-mode often replace with ^M and this will lead to many problems for some files, such as elisp. fold.el works in my emacs. I recommend use it in GNU Emacs. Download: http://uuid.com/~marcus/computing/fold-mode.html. I add some command in Lisp:fold.el
-- Ye_Wenbin
[new]
folding.el (version 2006.1118), folding-2.107.el, and folding-2.99 all work on plain text in GNU Emacs (GNU Emacs 22.1.50.1 (powerpc-apple-darwin8.11.0, Carbon Version 1.6.0) of 2008-01-17 on cf-ppc-macosx.usr.sourceforge.jp).  However all have unpleasant interaction with narrowing and widening in LaTeX.
[new] Is there a way to change the face of the folding indicator (i.e. the "...")? I would also like to change that folding indicator text if possible...
[new] And while I'm at it, any way of *not* narrowing every time I enter a fold?
[new] <code>(setq folding-narrow-by-default nil)</code>


== yafolding.el - Yet another folding extension for the Emacs editor ==

* It is a simple script folding code blocks based on indentation, so, no special strings are needed.
