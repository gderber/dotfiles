== Moving Between the Minibuffer and Other Buffers ==

Sometimes, when the [[minibuffer]] is active, you might want to move
the [[cursor]] and focus from the minibuffer back to the original
[[buffer ]] from which you activated the minibuffer.  When you are in
''Icicle'' mode, the '''`pause'''' key is bound (by default) to command
`icicle-switch-to/from-minibuffer', which does that.  This lets
you start minibuffer input (with or without [[completion]]), and then
interrupt it to search, edit, and so on, in the original buffer.
This same command (bound to `pause') then lets you switch back to
the minibuffer -- it acts as a toggle for the input focus; go back and forth as much as you like.

This can be especially useful when you use '''Icicles''' [[multi-command]]s.  In that case, you often keep the
minibuffer active for completion while performing multiple
completion actions.  It can be handy to interrupt this to perform
some normal editing or search, and then resume multi-command
actions.

For example, when using `g' (`icicle-Info-goto-node') in [[Info]], if
you use `C-RET' to show a matching candidate node, you can `pause'
to visit it, search it using `C-s', and then `pause' back to the
minibuffer to continue browsing other node candidates.

Another use for this feature is to select text in the original
buffer and then insert it in the minibuffer.
See also [[Icicles - Inserting Text from Cursor]] for another way to do that.

A somewhat related toggle is available using `C-insert'.
This lets you switch the focus between the minibuffer and buffer
`*Completions*'.  See [[Icicles - Completions Display]] for more
information.
