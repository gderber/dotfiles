[https://marmalade-repo.org/ Marmalade] was an [[ELPA]] compatible
package repository that allowed users to upload their own packages.
Package maintainers did not have to be the same as the maintainers of
the original code. This is somewhat like major GNU/Linux distributions.

The repository had availability problems and is now discontinued.
