= Note on Non-Nil `pop-up-frames' on MS Windows =

If you use '''`pop-up-frames'''' = `t', like I do, you might have noticed
that Emacs [[completion]] does not play well with using separate
[[frame]]s for each buffer.  In particular, it does not play well with
having a separate frame for [[buffer]] `*Completions*'.  When you try to
complete input using `TAB', a new frame is created for buffer
`*Completions*', and, at least on MS Windows, it is ''selected, '''taking
the input focus away''' from the original frame's [[minibuffer]]!''

This means that, once the `*Completions*' buffer has been displayed
in a separate frame, you cannot, for instance, [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycle]] completion
candidates, without first reselecting the original frame
manually.  You cannot even use normal completion -- you cannot add
text in the minibuffer, or delete text there, because the
minibuffer in the original frame no longer has the input focus.
''Bummer.''

In general, Emacs does not play too well
with one-buffer-per-frame (`pop-up-frames' = `t'), and this is a
good example of that general problem.  See '''OneOnOneEmacs''' for a discussion of this.  I reported this Emacs bug. I've been hoping it will be corrected since Emacs 21...

I do not have this problem of loss of frame input focus in my own setup, even though I use
`pop-up-frames' = `t', because I use my library '''<tt>[[oneonone.el]]</tt>'''.  (Try
it!)  If you need a solution while waiting for the Emacs fix, you can
try doing something similar to what I do in <tt>[[oneonone.el]]</tt>:


'''1.''' Use dedicated frames for both `*Completions*' and the minibuffer.

'''2.''' Display buffer `*Completions*' using a special-display function that
explicitly ''redirects the input focus'' from the `*Completions*' frame
back to the minibuffer frame.

See '''[[Help and Completions Frames]]''' for more information on this. -- DrewAdams
