Bugs: 

default fonts don't work. start emacs with  -fn 7x13 
sometimes you need to set -q

== Qtopia ==

One more port of Emacs 21.2.1 for Sharp Zaurus (Qtopia) you can find here:
* http://sourceforge.jp/projects/zaurus-ja/ 

emacs 21.4 (console) available here: 
* http://www.2gn.com/~jjorgens/zaurus/feed/

There is also a port of XEmacs there but I never tried it.

No GUI, console only but it works fine on my SL-C860. See also SharpZaurusDotEmacs --DmitriBrechalov
