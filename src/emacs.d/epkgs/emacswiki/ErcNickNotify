==What is ErcNickNotify ?==
ErcNickNotify is a mode that popup notify window when someone call you in [[ERC]].

==Install==
* Install notify program:
: In Debian it's simple, just type below command to install:
:: sudo aptitude install libnotify-bin -y

* Put Lisp:erc-nick-notify.el in your load-path, add
{{{
(autoload 'erc-nick-notify-mode "erc-nick-notify"
  "Minor mode that calls `erc-nick-notify-cmd' when his nick gets
mentioned in an erc channel" t)
(eval-after-load 'erc '(erc-nick-notify-mode t))
}}}    
: in ~/.emacs

Note: BEWARE OF EARLIER VERSIONS!  They were vulnerable to shell command injection, e.g.  with a message like the following:

{{{
<foouser> yourusername: `rm -rf ~`
}}}

This was *fixed in 0.3.1* (2011-12-09), upgrading is *strongly recommended!* Note that the version on Marmalade currently does *not* have the fix.
