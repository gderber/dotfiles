The following piece of code defines a function to look up single characters in the "kanjidic" and words or word-fragments in the "edict" files. You can get compressed versions of these files from [http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/japanese.html Jim Breen's Japanese Page].

<pre>
(defun find-region-translation (start end)
  "Find the region in the EDICT file."
  (interactive "r")
  (let ((str (buffer-substring-no-properties start end))
	(conf (current-window-configuration)))
    (if (= (length str) 1)
	(find-file  "/home/alex/elisp/kdic/kanjidic")
      (find-file "/usr/share/edict/edict"))
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (when (occur str)
      (set-window-configuration conf)
      (switch-to-buffer "*Occur*")
      (local-set-key (kbd "q") 'bury-buffer))))
</pre>

To bind it to a key such as `C-c j':

<pre>
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c j") 'find-region-translation)
</pre>

The encoding used for these two files is EUC-JP. If your
Emacs does not decode them correctly, add the following
to your init file:

<pre>
(add-to-list 'auto-coding-alist '("edict\\'" . euc-jp))
(add-to-list 'auto-coding-alist '("kanjidic\\'" . euc-jp))
</pre>
