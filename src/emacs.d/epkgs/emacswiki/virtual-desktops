== Description ==

Virtual desktops for emacs is a global minor mode which mimics the virtual desktop feature found in some graphical desktop environments.
Using this mode, the layout and the content (the buffer) of each of your windows can be saved as a desktop.
When switching between desktops, the layout of the windows and their buffers are restored as is: in the same place, with the same size and the same content.

== How to use it ==

When virtual-desktops mode is enabled, the desktop number is added in the mode line. By default, you will see "Desk: nil".

=== nil desktop ===
This is the default desktop. You can't save/restore/delete it. It is only a useless desktop. But you can use it.  Your windows won't be saved and it could be what you want.

=== Create, select and delete desktops ===
To create a desktop, use M-x virtual-desktops-add. All windows in the frame will be saved in a new desktop and this desktop will be selected. You can see the current desktop in the mode line.
You can create as many desktops as you want.

To select a desktop, you can use M-x virtual-desktops-next, M-x virtual-desktops-prev, M-x virtual-desktops-goto.

To delete current desktop, use M-x virtual-desktop-del. To delete a specific desktop, use M-x virtual-desktops-del-specific.

=== Update a desktop ===
A saved desktop is a list of windows with their associated buffers.
If you change the geometry of a window or the buffer it displays, you need to update the desktop if you want your changes to be saved.
This can be done with M-x virtual-desktops-update.

If you want your desktops to be automatically updated when you leave them, you can set the virtual-desktops-auto-update variable to t.
virtual-desktops-update function will be called automatically when you use next/prev/goto functions.

=== List desktops ===
You can list all virtual desktops with M-x virtual-desktops-list. It will create a buffer which contains a list of all desktops with their buffers.
This buffer is not yet interactive but this feature may be able "soon".
