I think more people should download copies of the archive for this wiki.

This way, we get distributed backup copies, and I feel much safer.  ;)

Sleep well Alex, a copy of the wiki is safely backupted on my computer.
Do you want me to set a cron job and download it every night?

Currently there is no locking strategy for the archive creation, so
if more than one person starts using a cron job to recreate the archive,
we migh corrupt the files.  Perhaps I should add that.  Right now you
have to look at the timestamp and create a new archive if you feel the
current copy is not good enough.
