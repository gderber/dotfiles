A bunch of Usenet groups exist for Emacs.

= Generic groups =
; [::comp.emacs], news:comp.emacs: Emacs and XEmacs related stuff.  [http://groups.google.com/groups?group=comp.emacs archive at Google]
; [::comp.emacs.xemacs], news:comp.emacs.xemacs: XEmacs related stuff.  [http://groups.google.com/groups?group=comp.emacs.xemacs archive at Google]
; [::gnu.emacs.help], news:gnu.emacs.help: Emacs related stuff.  Non free stuff is frowned upon (such as recommendations for certain books).  [http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/help-gnu-emacs/ Archive], [http://groups.google.com/group/gnu.emacs.help/topics?lnk=srg archive at Google]
; [::gnu.emacs.sources], news:gnu.emacs.sources: Emacs Lisp source code for Emacs.  Discussion is discouraged.  [http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnu-emacs-sources/ Archive], [http://groups.google.com/groups?group=gnu.emacs.sources archive at Google]
; [::gnu.emacs.bug], news:gnu.emacs.bug: Bug reports and feature requests, see also EmacsMailingLists.  [http://groups.google.com/groups?group=gnu.emacs.bug archive at Google]
; [::alt.religion.emacs], news:alt.religion.emacs: This group is dedicated to Emacs as a philosophy or religion.  See CategoryHumor.  [http://groups.google.com/groups?group=alt.religion.emacs archive at Google]

== Some groups specific to Emacs packages ==

; [::gnu.emacs.gnus], news:gnu.emacs.gnus: Information about the [[Gnus]] package.  [http://groups.google.com/groups?group=gnu.emacs.gnus archive at Google]
; [::gnus.gnus-bug], news:gnus.gnus-bug: Known Gnus bugs.  [http://groups.google.com/groups?group=gnus.gnus-bug archive at Google]
; [::ding], news://news.gnus.org/gnus.ding: The Ding list is for the CVS version of Gnus.  [http://groups.google.com/groups?group=gnus.ding archive at Google]
; news:gnu.emacs.vm.info: Information about the Emacs ViewMail mail package.  [http://groups.google.com/groups?group=gnu.emacs.vm.info archive at Google]
; news:gnu.emacs.vm.bug: Bug reports on the Emacs ViewMail mail package.  [http://groups.google.com/groups?group=gnu.emacs.vm.bug archive at Google]

== Other newsgroups ==

; [::sfnet.atk.ohjelmistot.emacs] news:sfnet.atk.ohjelmistot.emacs: A generic Emacs-group in Finnish, eli yleinen Emacs-ryhm√§ suomeksi.  [http://groups.google.fi/groups?group=sfnet.atk.ohjelmistot.emacs Googlen arkistoimana]

Some newsgroups that have more or less existed at some point in time,
but whose existance in the current point is not known include the
<code>gnu.emacs.sex</code> for those who truly feel passionate <3 <3
<3 about their most favourite editor and legendaric
<code>comp.talk.emacs.recovery</code> for those who've come to notice
their passion's grown wrong.

Some of the EmacsNewsgroups are also available as mailing lists, in
addition to the actual, real, proper EmacsMailingLists.  And vice
versa.  Generally it is better to read and post news.  Some of the
gateways don't work too well, however.  When reporting bugs, for
example, make sure you use the M-x report-emacs-bug command instead of
posting to the newsgroup.

One bidirectional gateway is [http://gmane.org Gmane].  Emacs has it's
own hierarchy there called <code>gmane.emacs</code>, most of which the
Emacs-related lists populate.  Its directory is at
http://dir.gmane.org/index.php?prefix=gmane.emacs.  Some lists have
been categorized differently though, for instance the [[MH-E]] groups
are under the <code>gmane.mail</code> hierarchy.  Use the
[http://gmane.org/find.php] Gmane search facility if need be.
