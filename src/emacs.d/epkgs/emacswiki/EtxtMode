A major mode for reading e-texts like those found on [http://www.gutenberg.org Project Gutenberg].

Basically it extends ViewMode with some handy keys, bookmarking, and the ability to automatically extract the text file from a zipped text (like those from [http://www.gutenberg.org Project Gutenberg] ).

Bookmarking the position in a zipped text file is handled correctly.

When visiting a file in the user set etxt-directory emacs will automatically switch to etxt-mode.  Then when quitting the file it will ask if a bookmark is desired.

== Installation ==
Put the Lisp:etxt.el file in your lisp path.

Add this to your ##~/.emacs## file:

  (require 'etxt)

Start Emacs, then set your ebook directory with: 

  M-x customize RET etxt

To start etxt mode visit a file in your ebook directory or type: 

  M-x etxt.

== Keys ==

; l: to have a speedbar list the files in your etxt-directory
; b: to see your previously set bookmarks
; W: to visit the www.gutenberg.org online catalog
; q: to quit and save a bookmark
; a: to set a bookmark without quiting
; SPC: to page forward
; DEL: to page backward
