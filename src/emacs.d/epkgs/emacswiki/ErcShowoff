Following provides two more commands (<code>/showoff</code> and <code>/detailed-showoff</code>) within EmacsIRCClient.
<code>/showoff</code> (abbrev is <code>/so</code>) provides a short statistic posted to the channel showing to how many networks, channels and users you are connected to.
<code>/detailed-showoff</code> (abbrev is <code>/dso</code>) provides some even longer statistic showing the number of chans and users for each server separately.

Example usage:

    #somechan> /so
    * hroptatyr is connected to 6 networks and talks in 31 chans to 1096 ppl overall :>

Be careful when using <code>/dso</code> as you may easily flood channels if you're connected to many IRC networks.

So, here's the code:

  (defun erc-cmd-SHOWOFF (&rest ignore)
    "Show off implementation"
    (let* ((chnl (erc-buffer-list))
           (srvl (erc-buffer-list 'erc-server-buffer-p))
           (memb (apply '+ (mapcar (lambda (chn)
                                     (with-current-buffer chn
                                       (1- (length (erc-get-channel-user-list)))))
                                   chnl)))
           (show (format "is connected to %i networks and talks in %i chans to %i ppl overall :>"
                         (length srvl)
                         (- (length chnl) (length srvl))
                         memb)))
      (erc-send-action (erc-default-target) show)))
  (defalias 'erc-cmd-SO 'erc-cmd-SHOWOFF)
  
  (defun erc-cmd-DETAILED-SHOWOFF (&rest ignore)
    "Show off implementation enriched with even more with details"
    (let* ((chnl (erc-buffer-list))
           (srvl (erc-buffer-list 'erc-server-buffer-p)))
      (mapcar (lambda (srv)

                       (chns (remove-if-not
                              (lambda (chn)

                       (chnm (remove nil
                                     (mapcar (lambda (chn)
                                               (with-current-buffer chn
                                                 (erc-get-channel-user-list)))

                       (show (format "is connected to %s (%s), talking to %i users in %i chans"
                                     netn
                                     (buffer-name srv)
                                     chnmn
                                     chnn)))
                  (erc-send-action (erc-default-target) show)
                  (sit-for 1)))
