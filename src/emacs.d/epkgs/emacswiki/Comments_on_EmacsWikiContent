I think this is an excellent idea! :)

I really like this idea! I'm myself interested in helping out with noob pages, as I was a noob year ago. While I found this Wiki helpful supplement, the presentation leaves much to be desired. I think I'm gonna do some research on what needs to be done and I shall put a sketch of the 'Noob project' here then.

FWIW, I have no idea what this page is about.  I tried clicking the title, but (probably because the page is new) no pages linking to it turned up in the hit list.

OK, so I then guessed that there must be a page with the same name but without the prefix ##Comments on ##, and I was able to find the page that way.

Clearly there should be an easy way to get to the page being commented on.

DrewAdams: look at the bottom of the page, there is a "talk" link. Also see here for discussion about it: [[Comments_on_2012-03-20]]

[[shjk]]: Yes, I know about ##Talk## and the discussion about it, to which I contributed.  The point is that there is no indication on a Comments page of what it is commenting on -- no link to the page that is being discussed.  This was your point in the ##Talk## page discussion, and it is still a valid point, AFAICT. -- DrewAdams

I think that one thing that might help would be a "CategoryNeedsAttention" category (or, better, hierarchy of categories) so that people with time to kill know where to focus.

I also think that the projects should all be part of a "CategoryProject" category, and that the pages that could benefit from that project should all be categorized appropriately. This would allow both progress to be noticed and the ability for people to get pulled in from the end-points, not just the center.

Of course I could do it myself but I feel like too much of a lurker.

Brandon:  Just do it!  Seriously.  Be brave. Jump in there.  What is the worst that is going to happen?  Someone might disagree with you, and start having a conversation with you about it.

That is all.  :)

The only reason why I didn't start with a Category Project category, is that I wanted something simple.  If this idea takes off, great!  I would love to see a CategoryProject show up, and this page split off.  I jsut am not sure if it is going to take off.

CategoryNeedsAttention however.. that needs to be made.

You will notice that people are in some cases mixing up using the '''Comment''' box with editing the entire page.  This can be either because there is otherwise (i.e., other than inserting in place) no clear way to respond to a particular comment that is not the last one, or because people are confused.

I don't think the current way of handling comments about another page is up to the task.  To be more useful it would need some way of distinguishing threads or at least identifying target individual comments.  This is similar to a flat list of blog comments -- hardly ideal.

Personally (so far), my impression is that this way of dialoguing about a page's content is worse than the perceived problem it is intended to solve.  But I am ready to be proved wrong.  We shall see. -- DrewAdams

Why can't the talk page simply edited as a wiki? Why the commentbox is needed at all? There should be an edit link on talk pages too, just like on wikipedia.

-- anon 2012-03-29 15:18 UTC

I think that's a vote for having "Edit" at the top of the page.  See [[Comments on 2012-03-20]].

anon: there is, it's at the bottom of the page just where the regular "Edit this page" is on articles.

I wish we could edit comments... I just posted a comment and I borked the syntax... would like to go back and fix it.

I've been thinking how I'd implement this and I think I'd do it with each comment as a wiki page in a namespace that restricted people from editing each others pages. Maybe the wiki engine would prevent changes after a certain time too.

Then the renderer would pull all the pages in the talk namespace for a particular namespace together.

As shjk said in the comment above: a Talk page is a regular page that can be edited by anybody.

-- AlexSchroeder 2013-02-23 15:12 UTC

Can we add a link to the subject page to the Talk page on the subject?

-- [http://nic.ferrier.me.uk NicFerrier] 2013-02-27 09:40 UTC

There already is -- do you want it bigger, or somewhere else? (Look for _EmacsWikiContent_ right in front of _Edit this page_.)
There was some talk about this [[Comments on 2012-03-20|in March 2012]]. Ideally we find a CSS solution. Alternatively, we mock something up using CSS but then we make some changes to the HTML output provided that it still looks good using a text-only browser such as w3m.

Aha. Right. It would be good if it was just "the page" or something... just an accesskey on the element would be good ALT+S?

-- [http://nic.ferrier.me.uk NicFerrier] 2013-02-27 14:24 UTC

Access keys taken: s (save), p (preview) and e (edit). I called the link "Article" and used access key a (article).

Update: copied the translations of Article and Discussion from Wikipedia for all the languages Emacs Wiki supports...
