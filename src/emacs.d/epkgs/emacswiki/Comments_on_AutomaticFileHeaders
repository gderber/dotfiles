Hello,
Is it possible to add defined functions and variables sections, like in http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/header2.el, that are automatically updated at each save?
<pre>
;; Commands (interactive functions) defined here:
;; 
;; 
;; Other functions defined here:
;; 
;; 
;; User options (variables) defined here:
;; 
;; 
;; Other variables defined here:
;; 
</pre>

Thank you so much for header2.

@Priyadarshan: No, sorry; I don't have code that does that automatically. I do it by hand. ;-)  I diff changes anyway, so it's easy to see what the names are and when they might get changed etc. But yes, it does take some time to do it. -- DrewAdams
