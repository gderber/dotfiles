= Matt Keller = 

I use Emacs on Linux and, when I have to, on Windows. I am a former vimmer who initially moved to Emacs to hack Common Lisp. Now I live in Emacs. It's my portable operating system.

For the dot-file peepers, I keep my emacs configuration in a [http://github.com/mattkeller/elisp public git repository].

== Code ==

=== mk-project.el ===

I've written a library called mk-project.el to manage emacs "projects" (see [[CategoryProgrammerUtils#ProjectSupport]]). 

Details are on at [http://github.com/mattkeller/mk-project its homepage at github]; see Lisp:mk-project.el for the source. 


=== etags-update.el ===

A global minor mode that updates your EmacsTags when you save a file. The code is [http://github.com/mattkeller/etags-update available on github].
