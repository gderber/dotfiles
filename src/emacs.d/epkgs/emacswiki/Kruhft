I use emacs, although I have used XEmacs in the past.  I've been using emacs for about 13 years now, have read the source code a couple of times and have finally started to get into learning to write elisp.  I change from using emacs for everything, to using emacs as just a code editor every once and a while, if only because I can never make up my mind about which configuration I prefer.  I find the philosophy and design of the emacs program to be very important, and it should be used as a learning tool for all future software hackers and developers.  Thank you RMS for sharing this work with us for us all to learn from and grow with.

Welcome to the wiki! :) -- AlexSchroeder

A belated THANKS @AlexSchroeder.  I'm back!  Dishearteningly I was searching for a way to register again and have to have another password, but read and realized the true hacker ideals are alive when it comes to handling the information contained here.  I plan to read, digest, and contribute, as being an Emacs user for so long, it truly has become a religion of sorts. 
 I feel like giving back in some way, and the code I contribute needs some more attention.  Plus I think it will be a helpful diversion from real work.

Thanks for emacs.
