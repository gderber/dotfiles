This page is about libraries that highlight the current column of characters.

== Library `column-marker.el' ==

Library ColumnMarker lets you highlight and unhighlight any column. With no prefix argument, the commands `column-marker-1', `column-marker-2', and `column-marker-3' highlight the current column. The highlighting stays on that column until you highlight a different one or remove the highlighting.

[:col-highlight.el]
== Library `col-highlight.el' ==

Library Lisp:col-highlight.el uses and extends VlineMode in several ways. It provides these commands:

* `toggle-highlight-column-when-idle' -- Highlight the current column whenever Emacs is idle more than a certain number of seconds.

* `column-highlight-mode' -- Continually highlight the current column, tracking the TextCursor as it moves. If you bind this to a key, you can also use it to briefly show the current column, by hitting the key twice.

* `flash-column-highlight' -- Highlight the current column for `col-highlight-period' seconds. Another way to show the current column temporarily.

Using [[user option]] '''`col-highlight-show-only'''' you can restrict the current-column highlight to the current text section of a particular kind (paragraph, defun, sentence, page, etc.).

(Easy installation using AutoInstall: `M-x auto-install-batch col-highlight' -- [[rubikitch]])
