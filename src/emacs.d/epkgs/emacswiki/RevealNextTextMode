This page is about library <tt>[[reveal-next.el]]</tt>, which lets you progressively hide or show text after [[point]]. 

You can use this during a presentation, such as in a class, to progressively show more of the text in a buffer.  As you move the cursor in any way, more text is revealed (or hidden, if moving backward).

There are two levels: show at least a [[line]] at a time or show at
least a character at a time.  User [[option]] '''`reveal-next-char-level'''' sets
the level, but you can also switch levels using command
'''`reveal-next-char/line'''' or '''`reveal-next-cycle''''.  The latter command
cycles among line-level, char-level, and off.

This library was inspired by this Stack Overflow question:
