Back in the nineties, there was a development environment called SQL Windows by Gupta Technologies.
If you no longer have the IDE but still need to look at old source code, here's a little piece of
code that uses OutlineMode to do the job:

{{{
(defun sql-windows-mode ()
  (interactive)
  (outline-mode)
  (setq auto-fill-function nil
	outline-regexp "\\.head \\([0-9]+\\)"
	outline-level (lambda () (string-to-number (match-string 1))))
  (hide-sublevels 1))

(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.app\\'" . sql-windows-mode))
}}}
