I've been using GNU Emacs since 1985. While I'll use Eclipse for developing Java now, I still use Emacs for everything else, particularly email. For that I use MH-E, the Emacs interface to the MH mail system, which I maintain ().

Hello and welcome. Do consider taking sides in the MuaWar.  I've seen the good arguments that are made at the [http://mh-e.sourceforge.net/ MH-E Home page], but I'd enjoy hearing more as I haven't taken sides, yet. :) Thanks for maintaining MH-E. -- AaronHawley
