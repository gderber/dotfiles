= On Screen Display Of Org-Mode Appointments =

RichardRiley

This code shows how to implement an onscreen display of Org-Mode appointments at the configured warning time. It requires gnome-osd package but it would be fairly trivial to use other desktop environment equivalents I think.

Another option is to use ToDoChiKu, which should work cross-platform.

The first code is the interface to the OSD layer:

<pre>

(defun rgr/xml-escape (s)
  (setq s (replace-regexp-in-string "'" "&apos;" 
  (replace-regexp-in-string "\"" "&quot;"
  (replace-regexp-in-string "&" "&amp;" 
  (replace-regexp-in-string "<" "&lt;"
  (replace-regexp-in-string ">" "&gt;" s)))))))

(when window-system
  (defun rgr/osd-display (id msg &optional delay vattrib hattrib font) 
    "Display a message msg using OSD. Currently requires gnome-osd-client"
    (unless vattrib (setq vattrib "top"))
    (unless hattrib (setq hattrib "right"))
    (unless delay (setq delay 5000))
    (unless font (setq font "Arial 12"))
    (save-window-excursion
      (shell-command
       (format
	"gnome-osd-client -f \"<message id='%s' osd_fake_translucent_bg='off' osd_font='%s' animations='on' hide_timeout='%d' osd_vposition='%s' osd_halignment='%s'>%s</message>\""    
	id
	font
	delay
	vattrib
	hattrib
	(rgr/xml-escape msg)
	)))))
</pre>

In debian, for example, you would install the gnome-osd package like this:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install gnome-osd
</pre>

Then we need to set up org-mode to use a new display function for informing the user about upcoming appointments:

<pre>
(when window-system

  (setq appt-display-format 'window)
  
  (defun org-osd-display (min-to-app new-time msg)
    (rgr/osd-display msg msg -1 "center" "center" "Verdana 20"))
  
  (setq appt-disp-window-function (function org-osd-display))
  
  ;; Run once, activate and schedule refresh
  (run-at-time nil 3600 'org-agenda-to-appt)
  (appt-activate t))
</pre>

I did try the window manager neutral OSD equivalent but it simply did not work well enough but if anyone does get it to work then please update here accordingly.

[new]
With osd_cat (package xosd-bin from debian) the function is similar:

<pre>
(defun org-osd-display (min time msg)
  (let ((vpos "middle")
	(hpos "center")
	(font "-adobe-courier-*-r-*-*-34-*")
	(delay 5))
    (save-window-excursion
      (shell-command (format "echo '%s' | osd_cat --pos=%s --align=%s --font=%s --delay=%d"
			     msg vpos hpos font delay)))))
</pre>
