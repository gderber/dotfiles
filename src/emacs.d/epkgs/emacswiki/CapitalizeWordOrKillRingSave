As a Mac Os X user, the only regret that I have about emacs is its lack of integration with the rest of the so user-friedly Mac desktop.
In particular, I have a _mental_ problem when switching apps, to or from emacs, that is, the change of the copy-and-paste key shortcuts. Even Mac Os X's Terminal.app understands the "M-c" and "M-v" shortcuts, while in emacs, We're stuck with those ugly "M-w" "C-y".

As I don't needed it (I have the "prior page" and "next page" keys on my keyboard) , I quickly replaced my "M-v" shortcut by a yank :
<pre>
   (global-set-key (kbd "M-v") 'yank)
</pre>

But I still had the "M-c" problem: I could not just bind M-c to kill-ring-save, because I really often use the traditional command bound to "M-c": capitalize-word. So I wrote this little function in my .emacs, and it really made my life easier :

<pre>
    (defun capitalize-word-or-kill-ring-save ()
      (interactive)
      (if mark-active
          (kill-ring-save (region-beginning) (region-end))
        (capitalize-word 1)
        )
    )
(global-set-key (kbd "M-c") 'capitalize-word-or-kill-ring-save)
</pre>

I'm posting this here because I hope it will be useful to others. Feel free to add comments, or to move this snippet if there is a more appropriate place for it.

This does not work in my Carbon Emacs because mark-active is always t. You probably have transient mode enabled. Here is a function you can use if transient mark mode is disabled:

<pre>

(defun capitalize-word-or-kill-ring-save-transient-region ()
  (interactive)
  (if transient-mark-mode
      (kill-ring-save (region-beginning) (region-end))
    (capitalize-word (or current-prefix-arg 1))))
</pre>

This means that you are one of those people able to remember where is the mark without having the active region highlighted ? Wow. (I didn't even believe that you people existed ;-) )
