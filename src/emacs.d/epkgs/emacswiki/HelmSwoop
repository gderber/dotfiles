== Overlap with HelmOccur == 
Some common use-cases of HelmSwoop are available in vanilla `helm-occur' itself:

=== Default `thing-at-point' as initial value===
`helm-sources-using-default-as-input' controls this behaviour. By default, `helm-occur' starts with the `thing-at-point' if it is available.

=== Cursor follows the selected occurence ===

Put the following in your InitFile:

<pre>
(defmethod helm-setup-user-source ((source helm-source-multi-occur))
  (setf (slot-value source 'follow) 1))
</pre>

=== Invoke `helm-occur' from `isearch' ===

Put the following in your InitFile:

<pre>
(define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "M-s o") 'helm-occur-from-isearch)
</pre>
