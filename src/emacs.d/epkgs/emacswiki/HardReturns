There are two types of Returns in computer.

1. Hard Return: Generated by user by pressing "Enter" or "Return" key on the keyboard;

2. Software Return: Generated by computer automatically, esp by some text editor software.

What is the point here? What does this have to do with Emacs? What is a soft return in terms of characters? If there's anything to mention here about hard returns, it should be what characters represent them on different platforms (e.g. Windows vs Unix), `C-M' vs newline, and so on.
