= Trac Wiki editor in Emacs =

I have written a very simple editor for [[http://trac.edgewall.org/ the Trac Wiki]].

The Elisp relies on a python file which implements the xmlrpc for doing the editing. This gets around Emacs lack of threading pretty neatly.

The elisp provides two commands:

* trac-get which retrieves a named wiki page asynchronously
* trac-save which saves the buffer to a wiki page

== Download ==

This is in a trac-hacks subversion repo along with the python that it depends on [http://trac-hacks.org/browser/traccmdscript/0.11 here]

== Note ==

This is not the only editor for trac's Wiki. There is a completly [[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/EmacsWikiEditScript Emacs implementation using Emacs' XMLRPC library]]. I couldn't get that one to work over SSL however and I find Emacs lack of threading a pain for important things like that.
