This library provides utilities for manipulating Unicode
characters, with integrated ability to return fallback characters
when Unicode display is not possible.

Some ambiguities in Emacs' built-in Unicode data are resolved, and
character support is updated to Unicode 6.1.

In Emacs 24 and above, it can be installed from the [[Marmalade]] repository.

== Quickstart == 

	(require 'ucs-utils)

	(ucs-utils-char "Middle Dot"         ; character to return
	                ?.                   ; fallback if unavailable
	                'char-displayable-p) ; test for character to pass

	(ucs-utils-first-existing-char '("White Bullet"
	                                 "Bullet Operator"
	                                 "Circled Bullet"
	                                 "Middle Dot"
	                                 ?.) 'cdp)

	(ucs-utils-string "Horizontal Ellipsis" '[["..."]])

==Available Functions and Commands==

There are three interactive commands

        ucs-utils-ucs-insert       ; ucs-insert workalike using ido-completing-
        ucs-utils-eval             ; the inverse of ucs-insert
        ucs-utils-install-aliases  ; install shorter aliases

 The other functions are only useful from other Lisp code:

        ucs-utils-char
        ucs-utils-first-existing-char
        ucs-utils-vector
        ucs-utils-string
        ucs-utils-intact-string
        ucs-utils-pretty-name
        ucs-utils-read-char-by-name
        ucs-utils-subst-char-in-region

==Availability==

ucs-utils is available at github:

: https://github.com/rolandwalker/ucs-utils

and via <nowiki>EmacsWiki</nowiki>:

: Lisp:ucs-utils.el

==Compatibility and Requirements==

Tested on GNU Emacs versions 23.3 and 24.1

For Full Emacs 23.x suport, the library [[ucs-utils-6.0-delta.el]] should also be installed.

Requires PersistentSoft
