you can add  following command  

export PS1="[${LOGNAME}@$(hostname)] $"

to your .profile  file

If, like me, you have installed both emacs-w32 and emacs-x11, you may have the wrong one installed into /etc/alternatives. I could not find how to change this as the alternative command is not provided by default (probably in some package I have not loaded). However, if, like me, you have a spare Cygwin installation around that does use the correct(emacs-w32 for me) version, you can simply overwrite the link files in /etc/alternatives with the ones you'd like.
