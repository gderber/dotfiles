This is a place to share your Emacs color themes.

To add your color theme edit this page and add <code>Lisp:color-theme-<name here>.el</code>. Then follow the link, edit the page, and paste the file. When pasting, make sure the first line on the page starts with three semicolons: <code>;;;</code>.

* Lisp:color-theme-ahei.el
* Lisp:color-theme-domq.el
* [http://edward.oconnor.cx/elisp/color-theme-hober2.el color-theme-hober2.el] ([http://edward.oconnor.cx/config/elisp/hober2-theme.el hober2-theme.el] is the same theme, but it uses the built-in CustomTheme functionality and doesn't rely on ColorTheme)
* Lisp:color-theme-inkpot.el
* Lisp:color-theme-maker.el
* Lisp:color-theme-reg.el
* Lisp:color-theme-tango.el -- Color theme based on Tango Palette

== Notes ==

See also the ColorTheme package for bundled collection of color themes.

== Themes hosted on Melpa/Marmalade ==

Now that Package.el (elpa) has matured somewhat, the best place to find themes is via M-x package-list-packages. 

Here's a few I'd recommend trying out (C-s to isearch in the package list.): 

* tron
* soothe
* purple-haze
* solarized
* subatomic
* zen-burn
* twilight
* deep-thought

The majority of these are both 24bit GUI and Terminal (xterm256) friendly.
