Hi!
你好!
歡迎光臨!

I start use GNU/Emacs effectively in 2002.  
I use Emacs for programming(c/c++/c#,xml,sql etc), 
study english,diary, notes, worklog, todo etc .  
Emacs tell me how to work, how to thinking, how to study.
so I'll tell emacs too. :_) 

I have a weblog: http://maddog.blogone.net  .
 
I like use tradition chinese.  
The Chinese word '無' is my favorite word.
