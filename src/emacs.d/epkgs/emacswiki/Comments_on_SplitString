Is there a way to easily apply string split within the buffer (transform the text)?
- I am currently save the text to a file, and then run ruby script on it - I guess there might be better way to apply text function in emacs to selected regions? some ideas? Thanks

I.P. Stone --- that name sure brings back memories. ;-)

Sounds like you want to (a) select the text, (b) copy it to a string (e.g., `buffer-substring`), (c) act on that string (e.g. split it), and then (d) delete the original text and insert instead something you came up with using `split-string'.  That's straightforward to do.  If that's not what you're asking, try to specify it more exactly.
