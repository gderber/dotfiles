After a net disappearnce of many moons, ThienThiNguyen has posted to [[gnu-emacs-sources]] proving that [[ttn]] is still alive and hacking.[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnu-emacs-sources/2007-02/msg00006.html]

There was also an explanation about mail problems in the post which also explains the problems with his Web-hosted Elisp packages:

  this mail address is temporary while i regain net.bearings
  after a half-year absence (i failed to renew and thus lost
  glug.org, drat); please remove it from replies (post to
  mailing lists instead).  we'll see how things go...

Bummer. :(
