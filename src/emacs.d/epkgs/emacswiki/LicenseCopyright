License let's you choose a licence to copyright your file by inserting the terms in the buffer you choose.

== Downloading ==

* http://www.marcelotoledo.org/stuff/license/latest/license.el

== Installing ==

To install, you just need to load it, an option is:

    (load-library "~/.emacs-dir/license.el")

JorgenSchaefer and I recommends the following setup:

    (setq comment-style 'extra-line)
    (add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook
        (lambda ()
            (set (make-local-variable 'comment-add) 1)))


== Using ==

If you run license like this: 

    M-x license

It will insert the license described in the 'license-default' variable, the default value is GPL. If you would like to use another license try:

    C-u M-x license

It will prompt you for the license you want to use, you may see the available options by hitting tab.

If you would like to modify the default license, try:

    (setq license-default "license")

== Some limits ==

There is no LGPL or GPL 3 in license.el, I added them in my copy and going to email to the Marcelo for a new release after some tests
