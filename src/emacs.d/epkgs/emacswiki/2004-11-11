I think the script has a bug that has lead to the loss of pages.
The suspected hole is plugged (empty pages are no longer saved),
but it seems that an odd number of pages has been affected:

!AdrianAichnerErcConfiguration
!ArunRaghavan
DCC_Chat_mit_ERC
!EmacsOnPDA
!JoeCorneli
jmontrose
!KevinRodgers
!LangPoll
!PortageMode
譌･譛ｬ隱樒沿 !HowTo

The pages that need restoring from a backup because they are linked from elsewhere are
JoeCorneli, KevinRodgers, PortageMode, and AdrianAichnerErcConfiguration.

I'm looking through my backups for usable copies of the file.
If you have any backups yourself [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/list-archive] please help.
