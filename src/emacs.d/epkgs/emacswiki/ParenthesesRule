 parentheses rule w/ a gentle flowing border
 guiding code and decision paths w/ exquisite order.
 at first the eye may rebel and deride them,
 but experience sez: what's important is inside them.
 do you wish for square-shaped ears?
 do you pine for hairy-ape fears?
 precedence rules and syntax so troubling
 vex my grey memory by halving, not doubling.
 but on rivers of thought so purposefully parenthesized
 an ideal is made real, a perfection thus synthesized:
 all peace joy or hatred comes from my own hands
 and mindful, i reflect, and make less demands.
 M-x hs-hide-all -- see the monkey float high above,
 dives in occasionally to show Emacs some love.
