Here's an elaborate example.

* Assume the source is in <tt>/home/me/temp</tt>.
* You want Emacs to be built in <tt>/home/me/emacs</tt>.
* You are using a cross-compiler, however, and you want Emacs to <i>run</i> in <tt>/mnt/card/emacs</tt> on another machine.

Here's how to proceed:

<pre>
 cd /home/me/temp
 ./configure --prefix=/mnt/card/emacs
 make
 make install prefix=/home/me/emacs
</pre>

Finally, tar the files in <tt>/home/me/emacs</tt> and untar them in <tt>/mnt/card/emacs</tt> on the other machine.
