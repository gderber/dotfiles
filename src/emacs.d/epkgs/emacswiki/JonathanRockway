I am Jonathan Rockway.  My website is at http://blog.jrock.us/

I try to help out with All Things Emacs on IRC, and I've written a few extensions you might like:

cperl-mode: http://github.com/jrockway/cperl-mode/tree/master

Stylish (Swank for Perl): http://github.com/jrockway/stylish/tree/master

eproject: http://github.com/jrockway/eproject/tree/master

If you have questions about any of these, please don't hesitate to e-mail me, or even better, ping me on IRC.  I am jrockway on #emacs.
