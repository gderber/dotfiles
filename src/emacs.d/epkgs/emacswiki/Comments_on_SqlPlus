Trying to get this working with Aquamacs, and no dice. After starting a connection, I get the standard SQL-Plus Release and Copyright messages, but then it just hangs.

I wonder if this is Aquamacs, or perhaps the fact I am using the Instant Client.

hello, I've got some bug in sqlplus output. The data of the result table is shifted to the left and does not correspond to the columns name. This is so with russian letters in columns.

 ADSTRNAME                                                                            ADDRES_ID  
 Советский р-н                                                            29           0        

29 must be under addres_id...

How could I fix this to enjoy this wonderful emacs mode?
