It's nice to have the chance to use a different search; I've been trying DDG for the past month or so. Usually it gets me what I need; sometimes I go back to google. :::sigh:::

The one thing I miss, and which used to work well, is being able to click a page heading to get the wiki pages that link to that page.

I have to say I agree with [[defensetax]].  It still works, but the search results are poor (not as good as before), I'm afraid.  No, I don't have specific search failures in mind; sorry.
