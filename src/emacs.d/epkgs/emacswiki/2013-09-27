Another move to a new host and a new infrastructure is imminent.
The admins of the new machine will be replacing Apache with nginx and the wiki will no longer run as a simple CGI script.
They have set up a *test* site. Want to help test it? Click some links, make some edits, and let me know if you find any problems.

[size=+3][color=red]it's beta! â†‘

For those of you preferring the classic look, try this link:

http://test.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=browse;bootstrap=0;id=SiteMap;theme=;css=

Actually, I already found a problem: If you start at test.emacswiki.org
and follow a link to a page, you get an URL like this:
http://test.emacswiki.org/EmacsWiki. If you then click on something that
involves an action, eg. the Administration link, you get an URL like
this: http://test.emacswiki.org/EmacsWiki?action=admin;id=EmacsWiki --
note how EmacsWiki is duplicated in the URL. -- Alex

Drew also found a problem: Something about the ElispArea setup seems to be
broken. Visiting http://test.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=elisp-area;context=0
results in a timeout. -- Alex
