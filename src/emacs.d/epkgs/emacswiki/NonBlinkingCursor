== X Window ==

On X Window, the TextCursor will blink in Emacs 21.  Use `blink-cursor-mode' to
toggle this behaviour.

Or in your ~/.emacs:

 (blink-cursor-mode 0)

== GNU/Linux Console ==

In Emacs 24 adding the following to your init.el:

 (setq visible-cursor nil)


According to EvgenyRoubinchtein, the blinking cursor on the GNU/Linux
console may be disabled on Emacs 20, by adding
(send-string-to-terminal "\033[?17;0;16c") to `term-setup-hook'.  This
results in a nice non-blinking blue block for the cursor.

You can get a similar effect by using the following in ~/.bash_profile
or any similar startup script:

 if [ $TERM = 'linux' -a $SHELL == '/bin/bash' ] ; then
     echo -e '\033[?17;0;64c'
 fi

This does not work with Emacs 21, because Emacs 21 uses ncurses.
ncurses will reset your cursor.  See CursorOnLinuxConsole for an
explanation and a workaround.
