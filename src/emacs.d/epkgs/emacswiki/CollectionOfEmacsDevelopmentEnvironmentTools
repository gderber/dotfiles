[::CEDET]
is a collection of tools written with the end goal of creating
an advanced development environment.  Emacs already is a great
environment for writing software, but there are additional areas that
need improvement. Many new ideas for integrated environments have been
developed in newer products, such as Microsoft's Visual Studio
environment. CEDET is a new project which brings together the various
tools built to replicate these features.

The CEDET home page is http://cedet.sourceforge.net/.

Check out the [[CEDET Quickstart]].

Major Components of CEDET:

* SpeedBar
* EmacsLispObjects (EIEIO)
* SemanticBovinator
** SemanticIdleBreadcrumbsMode
* SemanticRecoder (SRecode - A template manager)
* ConnectedGraphEditor (COGRE)
* [http://cedet.sourceforge.net/ede.shtml Makefile Generation and Project Management] (EDE)

Small tools in cedet/common

* InVersion - Version checking and requiring
* ModeLocal - Mode-local [[variable]]s and functions
* PulseRegion - Fancy [[overlay]] color blinking
* DataDebug - Utility for browsing arbitrary complex data structures

External tools supported

* GnuGlobal - supported by EDE file search, and semantic symref, and semanticdb
* CScopeAndEmacs - supported by EDE file search, semantic symref, and semanticdb
* IdUtils - supported by EDE file search, and semantic symref.
* Graphviz (dot) - supported by COGRE for diagram layout and export.
* ExuberantCtags - Supported as an alternate parser for Semantic for many languages, like Bourne shell scripts.
* javap - extract symbols from Java .jar files.
* arduino - ArduinoSupport for microcontroller tools for compiling and uploading programs to an Arduino board.

Issues

* Currently CEDET issues a warning "Warning: cedet-called-interactively-p called with 0 arguments, but requires 1", which can be suppressed by adding <code>(setq byte-compile-warnings nil)</code> in your .emacs file before CEDET is loaded

CEDET has changed very much and the development version is the preferred version to use.
Bugs are mostly fixed rapidly by EricLudlam.

Another component of CEDET is "Senator". Someone with better knowledge should delete this section and put description of Senator in the appropriate place.

Here's a description of one function Senator provides and it's use:
[http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=200804280303.m3S33anF007841%40projectile.siege-engine.com&forum_name=cedet-devel senator-copy-tag] - Puts a "tag" (an item definition) into a special "tag ring."

==How to enable the CEDET tools which were merged with Emacs==
In Emacs 23.2, CEDET was merged into the main Emacs distribution.
The configuration code which is explained in CEDET tutorials doesn't work anymore. For instance you cannot use (semantic-load-enable-gaudy-code-helpers) to enable the useful features.

TODO: please explain what code you need to load the most useful IDE tools provided by CEDET

I got a basic configuration to work with the following in my <code>.emacs</code>:

<pre>
(global-ede-mode 1)
(require 'semantic/sb)
(semantic-mode 1)
</pre>
