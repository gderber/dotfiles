Shell EXecute mode / Send to EXternal program

Whenever you open certain kind of files in Emacs they will be sent to an external application.
This works with find-file, from dired etc.

sex-mode.el is part of [NxhtmlMode nXhtml]

This uses the same functions as OrgMode to start external applications.
