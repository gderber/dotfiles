[[zh:Emacs快捷键笔记]]
This page is about the notation of [[key sequence]]s in Emacs documentation and in Emacs itself (GUI, terminal-mode).  

== Overview ==

; C-: means (press and hold) the Control key
; M-: means the [[Meta]] key (the Alt key, on most keyboards)
; S-: means the Shift key (e.g. `S-TAB' means Shift Tab)
; DEL: means the Backspace key (''not'' the Delete key)
; RET: means the Return or Enter key
; SPC: means the Space bar
; ESC: means the Escape key
; TAB: means the Tab key

A notation such as `C-M-x' (or, equivalently, `M-C-x') means press and hold ''both'' Control and Meta (Alt) keys while hitting the `x' key.

See the section "Kinds of User Input" in the EmacsManual ([[Manual:User Input]]).




== Angle-Bracket Notation ==

Some keys are referred to as "function" keys or "pseudo" keys.  This includes keys that are not among the keyboard function keys `F1',...`F12'.  It includes keys that might not be on your keyboard, but are on other keyboards.  It even includes keys, such as `##<insert-file>##', that are not on any keyboard, anywhere.  For one thing, Emacs treats menu bindings as key bindings: a menu item is implemented as a pseudo key.

Starting with release 21, the GnuEmacs maintainers decided to denote such keys by enclosing their names in angle brackets: '''##<...>##'''.  Examples: `##<delete>##' is the Delete key, `##<insert>##' is the Insert key, and `##<tab>##' is the Tab key (or rather it is sometimes, depending on your keyboard).

Modifier keys that are part of a key sequence that contains a pseudo key are sometimes written inside the angle brackets: `##<S-tab>##', `##<C-insert>##'.  And sometimes they are written outside: `##S-<tab>##', `##C-<insert>##'.

=== Are angle brackets really necessary, in order to disambiguate keys? ===

'''No.'''  If you would like to do without the angle brackets, at least in most interactive contexts (i.e., not hard-coded, literal occurrences), you can do so.  Just use library '''NaKeD''' (No Angles Key Descriptions).
