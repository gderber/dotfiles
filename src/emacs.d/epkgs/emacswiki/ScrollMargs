Scroll margins minor mode. This behaviour is also known as SmoothScrolling.

* Lisp:scrl-margs.el

Other modules with similar functionality are: <tt>scroll-in-place.el</tt> by Eric Eide, and <tt>smooth-scrolling.el</tt> by Adam Spiers. 

In emacs-20 and later, scroll margins can be controlled by the variables <tt>scroll-margin</tt>, <tt>scroll-conservatively</tt>, and <tt>scroll-step</tt>. See [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Auto-Scrolling.html Auto-Scrolling in the Emacs manual].
