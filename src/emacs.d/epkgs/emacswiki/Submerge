Submerge

submerge is a tool for cherry picking with Bzr. given a branch to merge to,
and a branch to merge from it will generate a log buffer and create an
overlays interface with these keys:

"p" previous change
"n" next change
"m" merge
"d" diff

It will scan the target branch for previous merges made with submerge and
mark them as merged so they are skipped over in subsequent merges working
around the issue of Bzr not tracking cherry picks.

This is a early release for feedback. Contact me if you are interested - [[codermattie]]
