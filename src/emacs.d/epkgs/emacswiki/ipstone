an Emacs hacker since 2010

- previous vim user, converted due to orgmode.

Some complains that Emacs is great but vim is a better Editor: - there are lots of rescues in Emacs, here are some of my contributions:
* [[toggle-viper-keychord]] : my current solution for the vi-like editing
* [[vim-current-buffer]] : an old solution, but not as seamless as I hoped.

Thanks DrewAdams! a grateful dired+ user here.
Guess my presence changed the 'Emacs functional state' a little bit, hopefully in a positive way. Much to learn to code in Elisp.
