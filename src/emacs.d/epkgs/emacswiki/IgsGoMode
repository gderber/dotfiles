igs-go is my relatively ugly hack to play Go over the internet in emacs.

You can observe games, play games, list users, challenge users, and list games. There is basic support for chatting but its a bit wonky.

I have made a bunch of improvements since then. but it's currently broken. Drop me a line if you're interested in using it and i'll try to unbreak it...I don't use it anymore.
