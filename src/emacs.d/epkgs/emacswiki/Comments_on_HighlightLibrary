Is it possible to highlight the characters in a line when the cursor is hovering over that line?

Do you mean highlight the line under the mouse pointer?

You can do that using library '''<tt>[[highlight.el]]</tt>''' by putting property `mouse-face' on the line, either as a text property or as an overlay.  That is, you use property `mouse-face' instead of property `face'.

And in fact there is a command for this: '''`hlt-mouse-face-each-line''''. It makes each line in the region highlighted when you hover the mouse over that line.

With a prefix arg it prompts you for the highlighting face to use. Use `C-h f hlt-mouse-face-each-line' for more info.

With emacs 24.5.1, I found I had to set hlt-use-overlays-flag to nil to get any highlighting.  Based on the discussion that's faster as well, perhaps this should be the default?
