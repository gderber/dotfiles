To get MailCrypt to work with VM, set the following hooks:

    (add-hook 'vm-mode-hook 'mc-install-read-mode)
    (add-hook 'vm-presentation-mode-hook 'mc-install-read-mode)
    (add-hook 'vm-summary-mode-hook 'mc-install-read-mode)
    (add-hook 'vm-virtual-mode-hook 'mc-install-read-mode)
    (add-hook 'vm-mail-mode-hook 'mc-install-write-mode)

= Sign on sending =

Here is a simple way to be asked to sign on sending, just put this in your .vm file:


 (add-hook 'vm-mail-send-hook '(lambda()
                                (cond ((y-or-n-p "Signer le message? ")
                                       (mc-sign 1)))))

This has been tested on Debian GNU/Linux (Sid) and Gentoo GNU/Linux with GNU Emacs 21.4 and CVS and latest available release of MailCrypt.
