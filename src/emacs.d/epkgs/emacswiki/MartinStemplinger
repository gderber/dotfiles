I use Emacs both on Linux and Windows. Long ago I even tried the DJGPP port on DOS (anybody out there who remembers it? :-)).

== Emacs packages I use frequently ==

* [[Gnus]] (to read mail and news)
* OrgMode (to keep track of my todos)
* JavaDevelopmentEnvironment (for programming)

I remember the DJGPP port.  :) -- AlexSchroeder

: Wasn't that horrible DOS window ? I remember using it as my first Emacs, and later I discovered NTEmacs. -- LucasBonnet

Sure!  But at the time I didn't ''have'' Windows!  :) -- AlexSchroeder

Actually this made me try Linux: Everytime I tried to start Auctex under DOS the machine crashed. So I decided to try a ''real'' operating system :)) -- MartinStemplinger
