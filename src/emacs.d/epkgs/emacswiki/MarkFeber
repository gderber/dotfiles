I have been using Emacs in one form or another since the late 70's.  In the early days I was often the builder/maintainer of Emacs wherever I happened to be working at the time (in those years there were some black arts involved in getting things to work).  Consequently, I've used a number of different Emacsen over the years [http://www.jwz.org/doc/emacs-timeline.html]. These days, my preferred Emacs is XEmacs.

However, as with many of us, I find myself in Eclipse more and more, but my fingers remain in emacs.

Finally, I've decided to address the anemic (albeit gradually improving) Emacs like behavior in Eclipse.


Emacs+: EclipseExtensionsForEmacsExpatriates is an ongoing Eclipse plugin that goes well beyond simple keybinding and attempts to mimic, where practical, the things I miss most from Emacs.

I took the approach of sitting down in front of Eclipse and writing a java program.  As soon as my fingers did something emacsish that wasn't supported by Eclipse, I switched to the plugin project and began developing.  This was, of course, recursive since as soon as I began working on the plugin, my fingers did more uncontrolled emacsing, and so the plugin has grown well beyond my initial intentions, and shows no signs of stopping.

Fortunately, the first few things were minor annoyances:

* /Ctrl-/*T* and /Meta-/*C*, /Meta-/*U* & /Meta-/*L* (without having to first select the region) were easy enough.
* Soon though, I was into sexpressions and kill-rings and starting to talk about real programming

Time passes and it is in use by a small, but growing, population.  See if it helps you with your Eclipse chores......
