Hi all,

I use Emacs for all major editing tasks and Gnus for email and usenet.  Have a look at my
[http://www.tsdh.org homepage].

I work on the following emacs projects:

* [[Emacs]] itself
* [[Gnus]]
* [[OrgMode]]
* [[EMMS]]
* [[Circe]]
* [[HighlightParentheses]]
* [[AUCTeX]]

My own extensions are:

* DocViewMode -- View PDF, PS and DVI files inside Emacs (included in GNU Emacs 23)
* ExecAbbrevCmd -- Execute emacs commands by giving an abbreviation

Have fun,
Tassilo, aka [::tsdh]@IRC
