If you're using EmacsForMacOS and compiled from source, you might be interested in using aspell to check your spelling.
OSX has neither `ispell' nor `aspell'. However, you can install `aspell' using [http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ Homebrew] - simply execute "brew install aspell" in Terminal.   [http://people.ict.usc.edu/~leuski/cocoaspell/ cocoAspell] is a port of `aspell' and can therefore be used by Emacs' InteractiveSpell and FlySpell.

*Note:* If you use CarbonEmacsPackage or AquamacsEmacs, chances are you already have a fully integrated aspell! Ignore this page.

== Setup ==

Add the following to your InitFile:

    (setq ispell-program-name "aspell")

The default value is "ispell" which is not what you want. Your aspell has been installed in ##/usr/local/bin## â€“ this directory should be in your ExecPath. If it isn't, you might have to add it:

    (add-to-list 'exec-path "/usr/local/bin")

Since cocoAspell doesn't install the languages in the standard directory and instead uses one directory per language, you need to set `ispell-dictionary-alist' appropriately. You can find more about this variable on the InteractiveSpell page.

{{{
(setq ispell-dictionary-alist
      '((nil
	 "[A-Za-z]" "[^A-Za-z]" "[']" nil
	 ("-B" "-d" "english" "--dict-dir"
	  "/Library/Application Support/cocoAspell/aspell6-en-6.0-0")
	 nil iso-8859-1)))
}}}

---

I found that I had to use AlexSchroeder 's config (-swiss) to get aspell to work:

{{{
(setq ispell-program-name "aspell"
      ispell-dictionary "english"
      ispell-dictionary-alist
      (let ((default '("[A-Za-z]" "[^A-Za-z]" "[']" nil
                       ("-B" "-d" "english" "--dict-dir"
                        "/Library/Application Support/cocoAspell/aspell6-en-6.0-0")
                       nil iso-8859-1)))
        `((nil ,@default)
          ("english" ,@default))))
}}}

Without both of the "english" entries, I kept getting errors about not being able to find wordlists. -- RyanDavis

Another thing to try: edit /usr/local/etc/aspell.conf and change the line starting with "dict-dir" to

{{{
dict-dir /Library/Application Support/cocoAspell/aspell6-en-6.0-0
}}}

Once I did that, CocoAspell worked fine with flyspell-mode.

== Other Languages ==

The following is the setup if you have English and German installed and want to use the Swiss dictionary.
`nil' is the default language.
Remember you need to get the appropriate dictionary from a [http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html GNU FTP mirror] (-> aspell -> dict) and unpack it into ##/Library/Application Support/cocoAspell##. In the example below I used
##aspell6-de-20030222-1.tar.bz2## from ##ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/0index.html##.


{{{
(setq ispell-program-name "aspell"
      ispell-dictionary-alist
      '((nil
	 "[A-Za-z]" "[^A-Za-z]" "[']" nil
	 ("-B" "-d" "english" "--dict-dir"
	  "/Library/Application Support/cocoAspell/aspell6-en-6.0-0")
	 nil iso-8859-1)
	("swiss" "[a-zA-Z\304\326\334\344\366\337\374]"
	 "[^a-zA-Z\304\326\334\344\366\337\374]" "[']" t
	 ("-C" "-d" "swiss" "--dict-dir"
	  "/Library/Application Support/cocoAspell/aspell6-de-20030222-1")
	 "~latin1" iso-8859-1)))
}}}

Now you can use `M-x ispell-change-dictionary' to switch between "default" (English) and "swiss".

== Previous Versions ==

It seems that previous versions installed the binary as ##/Library/PreferencePanes/Spelling.prefPane/Contents/MacOS/cocoAspell##.
