Lisp:repdet.el does RepetitionDetection.

Here's an attempt at detecting repetition.

The program below notices when you have typed the same key
sequence (between a minimum and maximum length) at least a
certain number of times.  It optionally displays the detected
sequence in the mini-buffer, stores it in a variable (repdet-most-recent-sequence) and writes it to a buffer.

Pressing 'F11' then sets the last detected pattern as a
keyboard macro in last-kbd-macro and 'F12' runs it.

This code doesn't work around the C-u problem (each command
is called repeatedly, whether that "counts" or not is not
decided, yet).

Load the file, do the same thing three times and a buffer
"*Detected Repetitions* will be created, containing the
repeated events.

"M-x customize-group repdet RET" can be used to customise
some aspects of the behaviour.

The last 6 lines get the code running, and set up key bindings
to turn it on and off.

The code uses LoopFindPackage by AlexSchroeder.
