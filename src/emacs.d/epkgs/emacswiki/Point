[[ja:ポイント]]
The TextCursor (not the MousePointer) defines the position of '''[::point]''', which is the text insertion position. Point is one end of the [[region]]. The other end is the [[mark]]. The mark is invisible (you can MakeMarkVisible). 

Though point is spoken of as being the cursor position, this is really only true when the cursor is shown before or after a character. This is the case, for instance, for a bar cursor. When a block cursor is used, it is positioned on top of the character that follows point.

You can set point by clicking `mouse-1' or using the arrow keys (`up', `down', `left', and `right').
