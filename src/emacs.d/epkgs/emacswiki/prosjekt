*A software project tool for emacs* - [https://github.com/abingham/prosjekt Project page]

------------------------------
*Description*

Prosjekt is an emacs package for managing software projects. A project in Prosjekt is defined as:

 * A top-level project directory
 * Files under that directory which are part of the project
 * Commands which can be executed on the project

Prosjekt is unabashedly based on the wonderful [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/eproject eproject], to which I owe a great debt. Prosjekt largely grew out of the desire to learn more about emacs and elisp, and eproject was the platform I used. I've been happy with the results.

For documentation, source, and other project-related stuff, please see the [https://github.com/abingham/prosjekt Prosjekt project page].
