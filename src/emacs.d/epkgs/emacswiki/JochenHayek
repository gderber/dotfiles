Why does /he/ write in 3rd person, singular here?
Because this text got derived from http://wiki.docbook.org/topic/JochenHayek.
And they talk that way over there.

Uses Emacs.

He has been using emacsen since like 1983,
first GoslingEmacs ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosling_Emacs|GoslingEmacs on en.wikipedea.org]]),
later (starting like 1993 or so) it was GnuEmacs.

Actually having been a native Unixer from like 1981 on or so,
* his 1st Unix text editor was ''ed'' on a PDP11,
* his 2nd Unix text editor was Berkley ''VI''.

He must admit he has always been using VI on and off since then.
My brain is actually able to switch from vi-mode to emacs-mode without too much pain and also w/o remedies.
But of course, he never uses VI (or VIM or whatever) for the real things, just for the tiny things.
Yes, VIM is multi-buffer / multi-window nowadays, and that's nice, alright, but then ... - we don't care.

----
He loves hacking all sorts of text in emacs and its various ''modes''.
Editing text with using massive mountains of parentheses or nested s-expressions is just big, big fun in emacsen.

----
His favourite programming languages are perl, ruby, xlisp, Common Lisp, Ada, …, and C.

Pascal was actually his first programming language back in 1979.

(Can we mention bash, zsh, ksh, and msh here as well?)

He is an "all Unix" guy, be it Linux or OS X or Cygwin nowadays.

----
He loves gadgets

* like his multi-functional router, the [[http://www.avm.de/de/Produkte/FRITZBox/FRITZ_Box_Fon_WLAN_7390|AVM 7390]],
* his Samsung Galaxy Tab,
* or his Samsung Galaxy SII,
* but also software gadgets like /DocBook/ or /DocBook/ /Website/

----
He loves address books (e.g. Google Mail Contacts) and diaries,
and he loves keeping them in sync.

----
Right now he is trying to get into the web business with perl (i.e. Catalyst or Mojolicious) and ruby (i.e. Rails or Sinatra).

----
He has been using DocBook since October 1998, when he worked with Derwent in London, UK.
He uses DocBook for all sorts of documents.

He fancied troff -mm for quite a while back in the 80-s, when he worked with Jürgen Gulbins.

He loves creating Relax-NG schemas and using them.
He even edits ApplePropertyLists in emacs (nxml-mode) with a Relax-NG schema, trang-ed from some DTD.
But that's another topic.

This week he started diving into ''DocBook website'',
maybe he will also have a look into ''SilkPage''.

----
Maybe he has to get used to Oddmuse a little,
i.e. having a few glances at TextFormattingRules will help.
