My name is Robert Williams.  I began with emacs when I was a freshman at Southern Methodist University.  I'm now a lead programmer and system architect for a silicon manufacturer.  I am the emacs evangelist in my department :-)

I use emacs for almost all of my development work, including Java, C++, HTML, JSP, and ad-hoc SQL queries.  I have not yet take the full plunge of using emacs to manage my calendar, contact list, email, etc.  But emacs remains my favorite operating system nonetheless.

I have a weblog at http://robert.freeshell.org
