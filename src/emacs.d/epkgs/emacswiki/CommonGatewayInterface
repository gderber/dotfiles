cgi.el is a simple library for the Common Gateway Interface, which allows you to service requests for non static web pages in elisp. Provides routines for decoding arguments to GET- and POST-type CGI requests. Yes, this is another because I can; I don't expect performance to be crash hot. Version 0.2 2000-04-25, under GNU GPL.
