== Who I Am == 

I'm a laboratory technician in Buffalo, NY.  I was introduced to emacs and unix at work and my computer hasn't had any microsoft based product installed on it in several years.

== Articles I've Contributed to Or Worked On == 
AimClient -- For what it's worth I added the part about ssh tunnelling.

EmacsNewbie -- I'm still working on a book review of O'rielly's /Learning GNU Emacs/ 2nd Edition.  I think I may have to pull if off onto a seperate page if it gets any longer

== My WishList for Emacs Wiki ==

* I want the questions page to automatically e-mail out the answer to concerned parties and file the answer in a faq when a response is made.  If the response is inadequate the person posting it should be able to repost for more feedback.

== Visit My Web Site ==
http://www.mathjunkies.com is my home on the web.  (It's a work in progress!)  My e-mail is danSPAMLESSmathjunkies.com  Replace the SPAMLESS with an @ to boggle spammers.
