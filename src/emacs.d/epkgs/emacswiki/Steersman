The word "Cybernetics" comes from the Greek word for steersman. Steersman is a library for remotely controlling an Emacs instance.

Inspired by and based on [http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1092503&forum_id=303383 Barman Brakjollerâ€™s Jabber Remote Control], and requiring JabberEl:

* Lisp:steersman.el

=== Usage ===

Set your connection parameters:

<pre>
   (setq steersman-password "secret"
         steersman-master "phil@hagelb.org"
         jabber-server "hagelb.org"
         jabber-username "agent"
         jabber-resource
         (concat "steersman-"
                 (substring (shell-command-to-string "hostname") 0 -1)))
</pre>

Connect via M-x jabber-connect or (jabber-connect) in your init and talk to it from the Jabber ID set in `steersman-master'.

You'll first need to activate it by saying `steersman-password'. Commands beginning with an open parentheses will be evaluated as Lisp code; commands beginning with a dollar sign will be executed in the shell. Commands for which a function exists named steersman-$COMMAND will execute that function with no arguments. Anything else will be psychoanalyzed.
