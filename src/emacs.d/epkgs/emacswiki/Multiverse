Manage multiple versions of buffers in an Emacs session.

Lisp:multiverse.el

`multiverse-diff-current' cannot work because executing `diff' asynchronously.
It deletes temporary file BEFORE issuing diff. I fixed. -- [[rubikitch]]

Thanks for the bugfix.

I haven't used this package for quite a while. Now taking a look at it it is strange I didn't implement storing the information about multiple versions between emacs invocations too. It wouldn't have been hard and it seems logical. -- TamasPatrovics

== Unifying save-buffer and multiverse-store ==
<pre>
(defun my-save-buffer (arg)
  (interactive "P")
  (if arg
      (multiverse-store)
    (save-buffer)))
</pre>
