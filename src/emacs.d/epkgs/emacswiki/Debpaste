==About==

Debpaste is an Emacs interface for the [http://paste.debian.net/
Debian Paste Service].  You can use this package for receiving,
posting and deleting pastes.

Highlighting is supported.  For example, when you post a paste by
sending current region from `sh-mode', the paste on the server will be
highlighted with "bash" syntax.  And everyone, who will receive that
paste with this package, will get it in `sh-mode'.

Full documentation and source code can be found on
[http://github.com/alezost/debpaste.el github repo].

==Installation==

The package can be installed from [[MELPA]].

If you want to install it manually, at first you need to install a
required [[XmlRpc]] package.  And after putting "debpaste.el" into a
directory from `load-path', you can add some autoloads for the main
functions to your .emacs:

    (autoload 'debpaste-display-paste "debpaste" nil t)
    (autoload 'debpaste-paste-region "debpaste" nil t)

==Using==

* Receiving a paste:

::: M-x debpaste-display-paste

* Posting a paste:

** For a selected region:
::: M-x debpaste-paste-region

** For a whole buffer:
::: M-x debpaste-paste-buffer

* Deleting a paste:
::: M-x debpaste-delete-paste
