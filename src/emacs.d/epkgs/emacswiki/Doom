There's a difference between a wiki and a weblog.  
Does that need explication? Compare slashdot to the wikipedia.

This leads to the following style suggestions:

* Don't sign your additions to emacs wiki entries.  If you do, 
you'll make other people reluctant to add their corrections. 
* Similarly, don't use first person.  Instead of saying "I got it to work 
like this...", consider "One method which works under GNU Emacs 21 is..."
* Strive for "neutrality" (which is easier, and more attainable than 
"objectivity").  Instead of rants and raves, attempt to make lists 
of arguments for and against; or of good and bad features.   
* If this seems unnecesarily impersonal, look for a more personal 
forum, e.g. comp.emacs.  (Despite what you may have heard, usenet 
is not dead.)

  No, no, no!  
  
  Emacs is without limit, it knows no boundaries, *nothing* is
  outside of its purvey.  It stalks across all platforms, it
  has a mode for all occasions, it speaks in every tounge yet
  known and will speak in every tounge that will ever be
  encountered.
  
  Emacs is extensible, it must be EXTENDED. 
  
  The radiant glow of the emacs environment can purify all!
  Verily, even the editor of the beast may be handled with
  it's terminal-emulator with impunity.
