We are all but functions in the runtime environment of the Great
Hacker. There he tests us. And when he `fmakunbound's us and turns on
the GC, then it won't matter in which modes we run. As well as it
won't matter whether we were large or small, whether we did important
things or whether we were only helper functions. All that matters is
whether we were well implemented or whether we were broken and
corrupted his data structures. And if he is pleased with us, then he
puts our code into heaven.el, which is the source for the Eternal
Mode, and there he will funcall us forever.

Calling EMACS an editor is like calling the Earth a hunk of dirt.
