I've been putting this off for ages, but it looks like I have to "get with the program" and have a wiki page.  Eww, I feel so dirty.  Oh well, at least it's an Emacs wiki which is only one letter shy of being right.

Look, I have no idea what should go here, if anyone is suffering from imsomnia bad enough to actually read this, tell me what you want to see.  Until then, here are a couple of links...

Eicq: http://www.eicq.org/

XEmacs & Gnus settings: http://www.youngs.au.com/~steve/XEmacs/
