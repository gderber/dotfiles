This page is for noting known [[CategoryGnus|GNUS]] bugs and, when possible, their workarounds. If you add a bug here, be sure to also report it to the Gnus developers.

* Bad attachment if using '''[[Icicles]]''' -- GNUS does not remove text properties when it creates an MML attribute value for an attachment. See:
** [[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#GnusBug|description and workaround]]
