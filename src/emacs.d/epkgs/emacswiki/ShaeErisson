It's me...

lately I feel like a WikiFixture

see one of my primary wiki pages on theOriginalWiki:
* Wiki: http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ShaeErisson
* email: mailto:shae@scannedinavian.com
* irc: I spend way too much time on irc.openprojects.net, find me with the nickname [::shapr] on #emacs, #haskell, #lojban, #python, etc etc etc

I use XEmacs, whatever is latest in Debian/sid
 at home, at work I use the latest Gnu Emacs in Debian/sid. I'm enjoying learning the differences.

I'd like to find better project management for emacs...

something like (narrow-to-list-of-files project-file-list) and then be able to C-s and regexp-replace in those files, as well (find-file project-file-list)

regexp-replace can happen with IbufferMode, it has a "do elisp expression in every buffer" command
MarioLang has suggested first class limits to the maintainer, that could be the basis of a project system.. but it's still kinda cheesy. How do you do build a "set of files" object in elisp? Seems like one is needed.
fileset.el would need to be integrated into JavaDevelopmentEnvironment, and what else?

find-file in fsf emacs takes an optional wildcard... hmmm

XEmacs imperfections:
* Shift-Insert does not paste from the X selection, but it does work in gnumacs
Gnumacs imperfections:
* M-x load-library does not have tab autocompletion

I wrote InternetTime (from swatch.com) for DisplayTime, check it out.

a discussion on #haskell about making a Haskell Emacs clone turned up this interesting link: http://cristal.inria.fr/ICFP2001/Abstracts/50.html

: The same paper is referenced in DynamicBindingVsLexicalBinding.  There is also code by SamSteingold, referenced on CommonLisp. -- AlexSchroeder
