This package provides a secondary behaviour to `keyboard-escape-quit'.
Basically, it will clean up your windows to get a more useful state.

Upon activation, several things happen. First, all buffers that are
disposable (as specified in `non-interesting-modes') will be killed.  By
default, this is used for completion lists and the like.

Next, any buffer that are neither bound to a file nor have a mode specified
in `interesting-modes' are buried (but not killed).  Furthermore, if an
interesting buffer is showing in `next-window', it is buried as well
(assuming it has been auto-opened through some help command and should now be
hidden again).

Finally, any duplicate visible buffers are replaced by the next interesting
buffer that is not already showing.

All other effects of `keyboard-escape-quit' still apply, of course. Think of
this as the ultimate "Get me out of here and make things nice again!"

Installation:

To use, save Lisp:interesting-buffers.el to a a directory on your load-path
(e.g., ~/.emacs.d/elisp), then add the following to your .emacs file:

(require 'interesting-buffers)
