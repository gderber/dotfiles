When one of the swapping buffers is in a dedicated window, only the other buffer is changed. So, to avoid that behavior I did this improvement:

81a83,84
>       (if (window-dedicated-p other-win)
> 	  (error "The window above this one is dedicated"))
98a102,103
>       (if (window-dedicated-p other-win)
> 	  (error "The window under this one is dedicated"))
114a120,121
>       (if (window-dedicated-p other-win)
> 	  (error "The left split is dedicated"))
130a138,139
>       (if (window-dedicated-p other-win)
> 	  (error "The right split is dedicated"))

It'll be nice if you could patch the official one.
