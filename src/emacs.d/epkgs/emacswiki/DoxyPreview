= Overview =

DoxyPreview is a minor-mode that allows preview of latex formulas, graphs, and images of Doxygen comments.

= Install =

Save the following two files in your file system:
Lisp:doxy-preview.el
Lisp:make-image.sh

Here is a screenshot: [[image:DoxyPreviewScreenshot]]

{{{
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/doxy-preview.el")
(require 'doxy-preview)
}}}

= Notes =

DoxyPreview is made of two part: one in emacs-lisp to  fetch the region between  tags like \dot ..   \enddot and another one  in shell  script that  takes these  region and  creates the corresponding image before rendering.

Thus make sure that the make-image.sh script is in a path pointed to by ${PATH} and is executable.
