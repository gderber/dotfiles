Longtime lurker, first time poster.

I Found Emacs: The year was 2007. I was developing on a Solaris box and I just had to believe that there was something better than nedit. It turned out there was.

I can poke my way around Emacs for my own purposes and read Elisp, but I'm not a bigshot major-mode programmer or anything. I like (require 'cl), ido-mode and query-replace-regexp.
