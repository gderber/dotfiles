==MS Windows Shortcuts==

Unix-like systems have symbolic links (symlinks).
Microsoft Windows has shortcuts. They are a bit like symlinks, but they are not
integrated into the operating system.
Lisp:w32-symlinks.el is an Emacs module making Emacs handle shortcuts as if they
were real symlinks. It works by utilising the Emacs "File Name Magic" -- files with
extension ##.lst## are treated as symlinks.

This module is written by Francis J. Wright and modified by Lars Hansen.
It works with Emacs 21 and 22. If used with Emacs 21, use Lisp:ls-lisp.el -- the
version that comes with Emacs 21 won't work.

This version does not work with Emacs 23.1.

From the Commentary section of w32-symlinks.el:

<pre>
;;; Commentary:

;; This file is intended to be used with NTEmacs 21, i.e. GNU Emacs 21
;; compiled as a native Microsoft Windows application and running on
;; Windows.  It should cause no harm on other platforms and might be
;; useful when accessing a Windows file system from another OS, but I
;; have not tested such use.  It provides support for symbolic links
;; on Microsoft Windows platforms by allowing Emacs to handle Windows
;; shortcut files transparently as symbolic links in the same way that
;; Windows itself does, by making .lnk files names "magic".

;; It contains functions to parse Windows .lnk "shortcut" (and also
;; obsolete Cygwin-style "symlink") files, entirely in Lisp.  It
;; currently (partly for historic reasons) supports `dired' explicitly
;; by hooking into the standard ls-lisp library (Emacs 21 or later
;; versions ONLY), which is preloaded in NTEmacs.  It does this by
;; redefining the stub function `ls-lisp-parse-symlink'.  It allows
;; `dired' to follow symbolic links when using either ls-lisp (the
;; default) or an external Cygwin ls program.  When run on Windows, it
;; also implements the missing `dired-do-symlink' command to make
;; symbolic links.
