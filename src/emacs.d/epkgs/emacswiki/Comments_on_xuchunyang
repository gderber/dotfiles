Hi xuchunyang and welcome to the wiki!
You added a link to ##http://www.linuxforum.net/forum/postlist.php?Cat=&Board=vim## which appears to be wrong.

# It says "vim" in the URL.
# It redirects to ##http://www.linuxforum.net/?f## which says "This domain has recently been listed in the marketplace at domainnamesales.com"... So I removed it.
