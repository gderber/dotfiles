Hooray! After I don't know how long, it finally works.  (Perhaps it was because this time I read nt/INSTALL)

2 March 2007

Commands used:

 * cd nt
 * ./configure.bat
 * c:/msys/1.0/bin/make bootstrap
 * c:/msys/1.0/bin/make info install

Worked fine.  I got the msys thingy from http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.10.exe?download
