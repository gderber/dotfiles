MyopiMacs -- View small portions of extremely large files using little memory or bandwidth.

* Retrieve only enough data to fill screen (or maybe 3 screens to pre-cache the preceeding and following screens for quicker navigation)
* Use ideas from HexviewMode for local files.
* Use ‘Range’ specifier with HTTP ‘GET’ verb.
* Use ‘REST’ verb for FTP.
