--PierreGaston

I have a question related to using multiple languages
[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/oddmuse.pl?Multiple_Languages].  I
would like to identify chinese text.  I think the best way to do this
is list 10 or 20 common characters.  Can you propose a list of these
characters?

How about this for a start, based upon some chinese course material I found via Google [http://www.bendigo.latrobe.edu.au/chinese/gb-v101.htm]:

啊 吧 地 和 会 就 了 吗 哪 那 是 要

What do you think?

If we ever add Japanese, we will put some Hiragana on the Japanese list... -- AlexSchroeder

: In east asian language, Japan, Chinese, taiwan use the Hanji character, call UniHan in Unicode, but it is 
 difficult to to distinguish them (Because these character are mixed). Japanese can use Hiragana
 katakana to identify( because most Japanese article will contain these character, but may use
  many Hanji character). but the Simplify Chinese and Traditional Chinese are difficult to identify,
 but it's ok. 

I think it will be:

的 一 我 是 有 但 這 这 你 和 了 不 啊 要 好 沒 

-- wctang

Thanks for the list; I'm using your list, now.  We'll think about the distinction between traditional and
simplified Chinese when somebody comes along and adds some simplified Chinese pages.  Thanks for your
contributions!  :) -- Alex.

After i seach the related data, this list may be more usefull, 
the second column is the character, and the fifth column are the frequency,

的 一 是 不 有 在 人 我 大 了 中 以 會 為 這 上 來 個 要

this is only used for taiwan.
