Emacs provides several outline features, some come bundled,
some must be downloaded.

* OutlineMode: hides blocks of text in a hierarchy
* HideShow: hides block definitions in languages such as C/C++
* OrgMode: the outliner that does everything (PIM, task management, publishing, and more)
* AllOut
* FoldingMode
* KoutlineMode
* FoldIngo:  A minor folding mode with mouse/menu/face support.
* CategorizingInformationManager -- provides ee-outline to operate on outlines
* FoldDwim: a unified user interface for the folding methods of OutlineMode, HideShow, FoldingMode, AUCTeX folding, and NxmlMode.
* TaggingMode -- add tags to your file, then filter the blocks shown using tags
* HtmlOutline -- shows how to use NxmlMode to fold <ol> based outlines in html.

There is also ooutline and noutline which all refer to
some version of `outline', so they are not worth mentioning.
