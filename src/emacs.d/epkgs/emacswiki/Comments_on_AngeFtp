I have used ange-ftp with windows ftp client successfully on Windows XP for several years. Now I moved to Windows Seven and it stopped work properly (with exactly the same emacs version). It took me quite a while to understand that, on Seven, the hash command does not include a newline in the end. Then you get things like

####226 Transfer complete.

instead of 

####

226 Transfer complete.

simple solution... 

(setq  ange-ftp-send-hash nil)

Hi 

Thanks for your great info about ange-ftp windows hosts

One small correction to the code that worked for me:

It should be either (1) or (2):

(1)

(msdos (string-match "200 .+off" line))
+
(if (not msdos)


(2)

(msdos (string-match "200 .+on" line))
+
(if msdos
