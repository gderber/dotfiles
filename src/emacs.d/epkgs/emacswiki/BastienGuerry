I use Emacs. I'm sometimes bz_g on #emacs and #org-mode.

Long time ago, I wrote BhlMode, which was badly written, but worked for a bunch of people.  I am not maintaining it anymore.

Right now I spend most of my emacs-time working with/on OrgMode.

I've also started an EmacsScreenshots group on [http://www.flickr.com/groups/emacs/ flickr].
