I noticed by accident some sophisticated, if stupid, spam on PlannerMode. It looks as if someone is taking the time to hand edit the page in such a way that links to spam sites actually look like reasonable EmacsWiki entries. I doubt that such links would be very efficient for bringing people to the spam sites, so I wonder what that is all about.

I'm a bit surprised that someone would waste his time adding such links in such a manner. Just curious. I wonder if sites are perhaps paying people to insert N number of spam links here and there? Can't fathom why this would happen, if not. Especially since the links go to completely different kinds of spam site. Just another mystery of the Web, I guess. -- DrewAdams
