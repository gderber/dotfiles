=Emotion Iconous Mode=
<i>Also known as emoicon-mode</i>.

This is a minor mode for Emacs 23.x (and <i>maybe</i> earlier) for adding emoticons.

It also integrates with JabberEl changing all emoticons texts into its respective image. 

== Download ==
You find the necessary in [http://download.gna.org/emoicon-mode/ this page], and the latest version from the [http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/emoicon-mode/trunk/ GNA! SVN repository].

== Installing ==
For using this you have to:

0 Download
0 Decompress files
0 Copy some code into the .emacs file(or InitFile)

First, in the .emacs file you have to tell emacs where to find the files you have just decompressed, this is accomplish by the following code:

    (setq load-path (cons "~/emacsstuff/emotion-iconous/" load-path))


Please, change <code>"~/emacsstuff/emotion-iconous/"</code> with the correct path where you have the decompressed files(where lays the elisp files, those ones that its name finish with ".el"). 

After that, you have to tell emacs that you want them to be loaded at start-up. So, add this code:

    (require 'emoicon-load-all)


Summarizing, add this code to .emacs changing the path accordingly:

    (setq load-path (cons "~/emacsstuff/emotion-iconous/" load-path))
    (require 'emoicon-load-all)



===Themes===
After installing the package you may want to add a theme. Just use the pidgin default theme! 

Usually you can find the pidgin theme in the following path <code>/usr/share/pixmaps/pidgin/emotes</code>, copy one directory(that in turn is a theme) somewhere more easier and reachable, like in a folder in your home directory(for example: <code>~/emoticons-themes/...</code>).

Then, customize emotion-iconous-mode by M-x <code>customize-group</code> and writing <code>emotion-iconous-mode</code>. 


Supported themes are those that are in Pidgin theme format and in plist format.
For more information see [http://home.gna.org/emoicon-mode/theme-format.html theme-format.org page].

== Using ==

== With Files ==
For using with files, just call the minor mode by M-x <code>emotion-iconous-mode</code>. Once called, all images necessary will be loaded and every emoticon texts (like this ":-)" ) will be changed with its corresponding image.

== With JabberEL ==
Don't do anything, just chat! :-)

== Changing Theme ==
You have to change the value of the variable <code>emoicon-theme</code> with the name of the theme you want. You can use the customization tool doing M-x <code>customize-group</code> and writing <code>emotion-iconous-mode</code>.

Remember that you must have the Pidgin or Plist theme files in the path determined by the variable <code>emoicon-path-themes</code>(also editable in the customization page).



For example, if your path is <code>~/emacsstuff/emoticons</code> and you download a Pidging theme called "fantastic-theme" you copy the directory with all the files into the path. Then, you'll have this path with full of PNG or image files: <code>~/emacsstuff/emoticons/fantastic-theme</code>.

Now, you have to configure the variables, do M-x <code>customize-group</code> <code>emotion-iconous-mode</code> and then change the <i>Emoicon Path Themes</i> with the value <code>~/emacsstuff/emoticons</code> and the <i>Emoicon Theme</i> with the value <code>fantastic-theme</code>.

As soon as you use the emoicon minor mode it has to reload the theme, if not use M-x <code>emoicon-load-emoticon-theme</code> to reload it.

Use M-x <code>emoicon-list-emoticons</code> if the theme has loaded successfully.
