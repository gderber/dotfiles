English: CategoryXML

These are some packages used for XML processing in Emacs or XEmacs:

* NxmlMode -- Major mode for emacs.  Probably the best available mode for XML.
* PsgmlMode -- major mode for editing SGML and XML documents.  This is more complicated, and feature rich than XmlMode, but less flexible.  If you have a validating DTD for your XML, PSGML will provide a variety of very useful features, most notably context sensitive help in inserting tags and attributes.
* XmlMode -- editing XML, indentation, font-lock offered. simpler than PSGML, doesn't try to parse DTD.
* XmlParser -- programming with XML, see also XmlParserExamples
* XmlSoxMode -- edit XML in a [http://www.langdale.com.au/SOX/ SOX] view.
* [http://www.menteith.com/xslide/ xslide] -- major mode for editing XSLT
* [http://xslt-process.sourceforge.net/ XSLT-process] -- minor mode for doing XSLT processing and debugging
* XmlRpc -- package for RPC calls using XML.
* TeXmacs -- intends to support native editing of XML documents (not quite Emacs, but it has a similar spirit)
* DtmlMode -- editing Zope's DTML
* [http://nwalsh.com/emacs/docbookide/ DocbookIDE] -- Major mode for editing Docbook SGML/XML
* [http://xae.sunsite.dk/ XAE] -- XML Authoring Environment for Emacs

Here is an article by BrianGillan (IBM) on Getting and installing
Emacs, Adding PSGML for SGML and XML modes, Editing a document with
PSGML, and Using SP or &lt;nowiki&gt;OpenSP&lt;/nowiki&gt; for SGML and XML

From the BobDuCharme book SGML CD, here is a longish (99 pages) chapter on using Emacs to edit SGML/XML files using PSGML. Also contains Polish and Russian translations.
