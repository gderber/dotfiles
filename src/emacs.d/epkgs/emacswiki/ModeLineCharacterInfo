This page is about library <tt>[[modeline-char.el]]</tt>, which shows, in the [[mode-line]],  the character after [[point]] and its Unicode code point.

[[minor mode|Minor mode]] `mlc-char-in-mode-line-mode' toggles this on/off for the current buffer, and global minor mode `mlc-char-in-mode-line-mode-global' does the same globally, i.e., for all buffers.

You can [[Customize|customize]] [[faces]] `mlc-mode-line-char-format' and `mlc-mode-line-char-format-code', which are used for the character and its code point, respectively.

Click the mouse on the mode-line character info:

* `mouse-1': Show more info about the character (same as `##C-u C-x =##' info).
* `mouse-2': Copy the character as the [[SecondarySelection|secondary selection]], so you can yank it anytime, until you redefine the secondary selection again.
* `mouse-3': Show the character enlarged, as a tooltip.
