This page describes a patch adding TLS support to an Emacs version older than version 22.  In Emacs 22, TLS is the default: use `open-tls-stream' instead of `open-ssl-stream'.

SimonJosefsson posted a message to emacs-devel announcing:

I rewrote my native TLS support for Emacs using GNU TLS instead of
Open SSL:

* http://josefsson.org/securemacs/

Beware, the patch is very ugly but at least it allows me to read my
mail over TLS with Gnus.

Install GNU TLS, do "aclocal" and "autoconf" in the Emacs directory
after applying the patch, build Emacs and load "gnutls.el" and you
should have the usual `open-ssl-stream' available.
