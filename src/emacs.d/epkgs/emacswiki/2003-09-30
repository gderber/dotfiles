The hosting provider removed /usr/bin/merge a while back, so that explains
why I and deego got a blank page after an edit: It was an edit conflict, and
merge was called, but didn't exist, therefore an empty string was returned.
The new script should handle this situation, and I've asked the provider to
install merge again.  In the mean time, I had diffs disabled, because there
is no way tell the script to use diff but not merge -- it is just one option.
