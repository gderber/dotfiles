I've made some [http://www.cafepress.com/danl EmacsWiki merchandise]
available so you can go out in
the world and spread the word about Emacs and the EmacsWiki.

Unfortunately, shipping to Switzerland is expensive and the mug at the
office is losing colors fast. -- AlexSchroeder

== Reference ==

[http://www.geekcheat.com Geek Cheat] has reference mugs.

Shipping is terribly expensive.
The reference is ok for basic movements, deleting, kill and yank,
saving, loading.  A pity that they mention `C-x (´ and `C-x )´ to
start and end keyboard macros, but fail to mention `C-x e´ to execute
them. -- AlexSchroeder

Another one from [http://www.zazzle.co.uk/emacs_quick_reference_mug-168555220654932118 Zazzle]

== German Reference == 

Lehmann's in Germany sells a Emacs Reference cup too. Go to
http://www.lob.de/ and search for "emacs tasse".  Note that, unlike
their vi mug, it is completely in German.  I have heard people on
news:de.comp.editoren say that it was useful for newbies.

Unfortunately, it is sold out, and they don't plan a new edition.

== Gnus Celebration ==

LarsMagneIngebrigtsen sometimes sells Gnus merchandise on http://www.gnus.org.

I bought mugs celebrating pGnus at the time, and I am very happy with them.  No
fading in the washing machine, and a cool logo, and a cool poem, too:
''In a cloud bones of steel.'' -- AlexSchroeder

== Various ==

[http://openstuff.net/index.py/categ/categ/19 Open Stuff has Emacs Merchandise]
as well -- various T-shirts with Emacs logo and Emacswiki ;-)

[http://www.cafepress.com/kruhft kruhft] - hacker shirts with an edge (and emacs references)
