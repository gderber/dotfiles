[[ja:カテゴリ・XML]]
These are some packages used for XML processing in Emacs or XEmacs:

* [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview|Icicles Search]] has commands to search the contents of selected XML elements (e.g. those in the [[region]]):
** '''`icicle-search-xml-element'''' -- search elements whose names match a [[regexp]]
** '''`icicle-search-thing'''' with thing-type `sexp' -- when in `nxml-mode'.  Option `nxml-sexp-element-flag' controls what [[sexp]] means -- set it to `t' if you want whole elements as sexps.
* NxmlMode -- Major mode for emacs.  Probably the best available mode for XML.
* PsgmlMode -- major mode for editing SGML and XML documents.  This is more complicated, and feature rich than XmlMode, but less flexible.  If you have a validating DTD for your XML, using PSGML will provide a variety of very useful features, most notably context sensitive help in inserting tags and attributes.
* XmlMode -- editing XML, indentation, font-lock offered. simpler than PSGML, doesn't try to parse DTD.
* XmlParser -- programming with XML, see also XmlParserExamples
* XmlSoxMode -- edit XML in a [http://www.langdale.com.au/SOX/ SOX] view.
* [http://www.menteith.com/wiki/xslide xslide] -- major mode for editing XSLT
* [http://xslt-process.sourceforge.net/ XSLT-process] -- minor mode for doing XSLT processing and debugging
* [https://github.com/maksle/xslt-dependencies XSLT-dependencies] -- minor mode for viewing XSLT 1.0 dependencies in a graph
* XmlRpc -- package for RPC calls using XML.
* TeXmacs -- intends to support native editing of XML documents (not quite Emacs, but it has a similar spirit)
* DtmlMode -- editing Zope's DTML
* DocbookXmlMode -- Major mode for Emacs with specific knowledge of the DocBook catalog.
* TextEncodingInitiativeEmacs -- Emacs distribution for authoring TEI XML documents.
* [http://xae.sunsite.dk/ XAE] -- XML Authoring Environment for Emacs (link is broken).
* XmlCoding -- coding system from ?xml tag (Emacs 21)
* XmlGen -- sexp -> xml generation.

Here is an article by BrianGillan (IBM) on Getting and installing
Emacs, Adding PSGML for SGML and XML modes, Editing a document with
PSGML, and Using SP or <nowiki>OpenSP</nowiki> for SGML and XML

From the BobDuCharme book SGML CD, here is a longish (99 pages) chapter on using Emacs to edit SGML/XML files using PSGML. Also contains Polish and Russian translations.
