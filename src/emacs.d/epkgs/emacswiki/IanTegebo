I use Emacs.

= RFCs/Proposals =

* [[Flavors]] - formalizing large customizations of Emacs

= Notes =

* ElispStaticAnalysis
** http://people.cs.aau.dk/~normark/emacs-lisp/emacs-lisp-static-analysis/index.html Kurt Normark (2006?)
** "Dynamic Scope Analysis for Emacs Lisp" - Matthias Neubauer 2000
** DownWithEmacsLisp - "Down with Emacs Lisp: Dynamic Scope Analysis" - Matthias Neubauer and Michael Sperber 2001
* Shims
** What are the ways to preserve backwards compatibility between versions of Emacs?
*** ElispCompatibility - not much help

* [[rx]] - I appreciated Perl's ##/x## modifier, so this approach is appealing.
