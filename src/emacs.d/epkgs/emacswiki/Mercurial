Mercurial (aka <code>hg</code>) is a distributed version control system much like [[Git]], [[Bazaar]]
and DaRcs.

Mercurial is available from http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Mercurial.

== Modes ==

* [[VC]] -- supports Mercurial.
* [[DVC]] -- supports Mercurial.
* MercurialMode -- A user interface specific to Mercurial.
* [https://es.fbk.eu/people/griggio/ahg.html aHg] -- A simple Mercurial UI inspired by DVC
* [https://github.com/ananthakumaran/monky monky] -- A Mercurial interface that imitates [[Magit]]

vc-hg-push and vc-hg-pull are broken in vc-hg.el (emacs23). vc-hg-command has to be called via an apply.

== Using diff-mode for MQ patches ==

Mercurial's MQ extension uses patch files which are more convenient to
read with [[DiffMode]]. diff-mode can not, however, guess the
correct base directory, so applying and reverting hunks won't work out
of the box. Here's a hook that fixes the problem:

  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.hg/patches\\(?:-[^/]+\\)?/" . diff-mode))

  (defun mq-patch-set-default-directory ()
    (when (string= ".hg" (nth 2 (reverse (split-string default-directory "/"))))
      (setq default-directory (expand-file-name (concat default-directory "../../")))))
  (add-hook 'diff-mode-hook 'mq-patch-set-default-directory)
