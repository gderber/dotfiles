== Introduction ==

vcursor.el has been part of Gnu Emacs since version 21.2.

It is inspired by an editing mode provided by the BBC Micro (c. 1981), providing a virtual cursor which can be moved independently of point and used as a source of text to copy and paste.

== Getting started ==

In fact, it is very easy to pick up the basic idea if you try it:

 (setq vcursor-key-bindings 't)      ;; enable default bindings to try it out
 (load "vcursor")

Then try C-S-up, C-S-left, C-S-insert to see the effect.

After that you'll probably want to read the instructions in the file.

== But is it really useful? ==

Back in the days of the BBC Micro, this was the best editing mode available.  But in the Emacs world does anyone find it useful for everyday editing?
