This page describes library '''Synonyms''', <tt>[[synonyms.el]]</tt>, by DrewAdams, which lets you search and browse an English thesaurus, the Moby Thesaurus II file,
`<tt>mthesaur.txt</tt>', which is available here: https://archive.org/details/mobythesauruslis03202gut. 

== So, What's a Thesaurus, Anyway? ==

'''Synonyms''' uses Moby Thesaurus II, but there is nothing special about that.  In fact, you could alternatively use any file of ''comma-separated values'' (CSV) as your thesaurus. All that matters is that the file is organized as lines of comma-separated values. The first term in each line is in some (navigational) sense treated as an '''entry'''. Each of the other terms in the same line are treated as '''synonyms''', which really means only that they are, for some reason, grouped together.

If, for example, you had a CSV file of personal contacts, where
the first term in each line was a last name or a company name, then
you could use library '''Synonyms''' to query it or browse it, producing the same
kind of output as for the thesaurus. Similarly, if you had a thesaurus in another language, besides English, you can use that instead.

The thesaurus is divided into '''entries''', which are like glossary
entries: each entry is followed by associated words and phrases,
which, for lack of a better word, I refer to as '''synonyms'''.
For example, `democracy' is an entry, and it is followed by its
synonyms.  Some synonyms are not also entries.  For example,
`patriarchy' is in the thesaurus as a synonym but not as an entry.

'''Note:''' What I call "synonyms" here are not necessarily synonyms, in
the sense of having the same or even similar meanings.  They are
simply terms collected together with the same thesaurus entry
because they are ''related in some way'' -- the grouping is what defines their relation.  In Moby Thesaurus II,  the meanings of synonyms in the same group do have
something in common, but this might be simply the fact that they
are terms of a similar kind.  For example, the "synonyms" following the `democracy'
thesaurus entry are words such as
`dictatorship' and `autocracy'.  These are different forms of the
same general thing: government -- they are certainly not synonymous with each other or with the entry `democracy'.




== Using Synonyms ==

You can use Synonyms to ''search'' and ''browse'' the thesaurus.

=== Searching the Thesaurus ===

The main command is `synonyms'.  It prompts you
for a word or phrase to look up in the thesaurus.  The synonyms
found are then displayed -- simple.  For example, `<tt>M-x
synonyms RET democracy</tt>' displays synonyms for `democracy'.

The default input value for command `synonyms' is the word under
the [[cursor]] or the text in the [[region]] (selection), provided that a
region is active and you are in TransientMarkMode (recommended).

Your input is actually treated as a '''''regular expression''''' ([[regexp]]),
so you can also input patterns like `<tt>for.*ion</tt>', which will match
thesaurus entries `formation', `formulation', `fornication',
`fortification', and `<tt>forward motion</tt>'.  Note that the last of
these is a phrase rather than a single word.

Using a regexp as input is a powerful way to search, but be aware
that it can be costly in CPU time and computer memory if the regexp is not appropriate.  The regexp
`<tt>.*</tt>' will, for example, likely use up available memory before
being able to return the ''entire'' thesaurus (it's very large).  You can always use
`C-g' to interrupt a thesaurus search if you mistakenly use an
inefficient regexp.

=== Using a Prefix Argument To Do More ===

You can use a ''prefix argument'' to modify searching and the
presentation of search results, as follows:

* `C-u'     -- Search for additional synonyms, in two senses:

## Return also synonyms that are matched ''partially'' by the input.

## Search the entire thesaurus for input matches, even if the input matches a thesaurus ''entry''.

* `M--'     -- ''Append'' the search results to the any previous
              results, in buffer `*Synonyms*'.  (Normally, the new
              results replace any previous results.)

* `C-u C-u' -- This is the same as `C-u' plus `M--': Search more and append results.

==== Preferences (Options) ====

If you find yourself often using a particular prefix argument (for
example, to append results), then you might want to instead change
the default behavior to reflect this preference.  Options
`synonyms-match-more-flag' and `synonyms-append-result-flag'
correspond to using `C-u' and `M--', respectively.  In fact, a
prefix argument simply toggles the value of the corresponding
option for the duration of the command.  So, for example, if
`synonyms-append-result-flag' is `t' and you use `M--', then results
will not be appended.

==== Partially Matching ( `C-u, sense #1) ====

When partially matching input (`C-u', sense #1), complete synonyms are
matched against your input.  This means that you generally need
not add a preceding or trailing `<tt>.*</tt>' to try to match a complete
synonym.  For example, input `format' will match the complete
synonyms `conformation', `efformation', `format', `formation',
`formative', `formational', `information', `informative',
`informational', `malformation', `deformation', `reformation',
`transformation', `reformatory', and so on -- there is no need to
input `<code>.*format.*</code>' to match the same synonyms.

==== Searching Beyond Entries ( `C-u, sense #2) ====

To better understand the meaning of #2 above for `C-u' (to
continue the search even if your input matches an entry), try, for
example, `C-u M-x synonyms RET widespread'.  You'll see not only
the main synonyms listed for `widespread' as an entry, but also
lots of different meanings of `widespread', judging by the entries
for which it is listed as a synonym:

  `accepted', `ample', `broad', `broadcast', `capacious',
  `catholic', `commodious', `commonness', `conventional',
  `currency', `current', `customary', `deep', `deltoid',
  `diffuse', `discrete', `dispersed', `disseminated',
  `dissipated', `distributed', `epidemic', `established',
  `everyday', `expansive', `extended', `extensive', `familiar',
  `fan shaped', `far flung', `far reaching', `flaring', `full',
  `general', `indiscriminate', `infinite', `large scale',
  `liberal', `normal', `normality', `open', `ordinary',
  `outstretched', `pervasive', `popular', `prescribed',
  `prescriptive', `prevailing', `prevalence', `prevalent',
  `public', `rampant', `received', `regnant', `regular',
  `regulation', `reign', `rife', `roomy', `ruling', `run',
  `scattered', `set', spacious`', `sparse', `splay', `sporadic',
  `sprawling', `spread', `standard', `stock', `straggling',
  `stretched out', `sweeping', `time-honored', `traditional',
  `universal', `usual', `vast', `voluminous', `wholesale', `wide
  open', `wide', and `wonted'.

These are just the ''entries''! Each of these is of course followed by
its own synonyms - perhaps 100 or 300, including `widespread'.

This list of entries is not the same list as the synonyms for
entry `widespread'.  There are words and phrases here that are not
in the latter list, and vice versa.  For example, the former (but
not the latter) list includes `full'; the latter (but not the
former) list includes `wide-reaching'.

The latter are the words most closely related to `widespread'.
The list above are the other thesaurus entries (corresponding to
main categories) to which `widespread' is most closely related.
Looking at all of the synonym groups in which `widespread' appears
can tell you additional information about its meanings - and it
can provide additional synonyms for `widespread'.

=== Using Completion with Synonyms ===

You can complete words and phrases in the [[minibuffer]], as input to
command `synonyms', and you can use '''Synonyms''' together with '''[[Icicles]]'''
to complete a partial word in a text buffer into a word or phrase
in the thesaurus.

==== Minibuffer Input Completion ====

You can enter any text to match against thesaurus synonyms.  When
you are prompted by command `synonyms' to enter this text, you can
also use input ''[[completion]]'' to complete to a thesaurus synonym.  That is,
even though you can enter any text (including a regexp),
completion will only complete to synonyms in the thesaurus.

Two different versions of the main command, `synonyms', are
provided here.  If '''[[Icicles]]''' has already been loaded
when you load <tt>[[synonyms.el]]</tt> (recommended), then the second, more powerful version
is used; if not, the first version is used.  The second takes
advantage of all '''Icicles''' features.  In particular, it lets you:

* Use `S-TAB' during completion to see the list of all synonyms
   (thesaurus terms) that match your minibuffer input so far.

* Use `<tt>[next]</tt>', and `<tt>[prior]</tt>' (usually keys '''Page Down''' and '''Page Up''') during completion to ''cycle'' through the completion candidates (synonyms) that match your input.

* Use `C-o', `<tt>C-[next]</tt>', and `<tt>[C-prior]</tt>' during completion to ''display the synonyms'' of the current completion candidate.

==== Completing Text Using the Thesaurus ====

'''Icicles''' provides two commands for using completion to insert
thesaurus entries in a buffer:

* `icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry' completes a word in a text
   buffer to any word or phrase in the thesaurus.  I bind it to
   `##C-c /##'.

* `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry' inserts thesaurus words and
   phrases in a text buffer.  It is a ''multi-command'', which means
   that, within a single call to it, you can insert any number of
   thesaurus entries, in succession.  If you want to, you can
   write an entire book using a single call to
   `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry'!

See [[Icicles - Multi-Commands]] for more information on multi-commands.




=== Browsing the Thesaurus ===

Besides using command `synonyms' to search for synonyms, you can
use Synonyms to browse the thesaurus.  This is really just the
same thing as searching, but key and mouse bindings are provided in buffer `*Synonyms*', so you need not input anything -- just
point and click the hyperlinks.  Buffer `*Synonyms*' is in Synonyms major mode, which provides a few additional features.

You can still choose to search (browse) for additional synonyms or append
search results, without bothering with a prefix argument, by using modifier keys (Control, Meta) with a
mouse click:

* `C-mouse-2' -- same as `C-u' (or `C-RET')
* `M-mouse-2' -- same as `M--' (or `M-RET')
* `C-M-mouse-2' -- same as `C-u C-u' (or `C-M RET')

Easy to remember; easy to use. 

Another way of browsing is to revisit previous search-result
pages.  You can do this using commands `synonyms-history-backward'
and `synonyms-history-forward'.  In buffer `*Synonyms*', these are
bound to the following [[key sequence]]s, for convenience:

* `l', `p', `mouse-4' -- backward
* `r', `n', `mouse-5' -- forward

The `l' and `r' bindings correspond to the history bindings in
InfoMode.  The `p' and `n' bindings stand for "previous" and "next".
The bindings to additional mouse buttons correspond to typical
bindings for '''Back''' and '''Forward''' in Web browsers.

In addition to these bindings, the same history commands can be
accessed by clicking links <tt>[Back]</tt> and <tt>[Forward]</tt> with `mouse-2'.

If you have previously used the append option (via, for example,
`M-mouse2'), so that there are multiple search results in buffer
`*Synonyms*', then using a history command simply takes you to the
preceding (for <tt>[Back]</tt>) or following (for <tt>[Forward]</tt>) result in the
buffer, measured from the current cursor position.  Depending on
the cursor position, this might be different from the previous or
next search made previously.

This is for convenience, but it is also more efficient in the case
of a regexp search that takes a long time.  Except for this
special treatment of appended results, whenever you navigate the
search-results history you are actually searching again for a
synonym you sought previously.  The case of appended results is
analogous to accessing a Web browser cache when navigating the
history.

You can of course use modifier keys (Control, Meta) while you click
links <tt>[Back]</tt> and <tt>[Forward]</tt>, to impose their usual behavior:
search for additional synonyms or append search results, or both.

Finally, some people prefer menus, so there is a '''Synonyms''' [[menu bar]]
menu when you are in Synonyms mode, complete with all of the
functionalities described above.

For more information on the browsing possibilities in buffer
`*Synonyms*', use `<tt>?</tt>' in Synonyms mode.

=== Dictionary Definitions, Antonyms, etc. ===

'''Synonyms''' works with a large but simple database of groups of words
and phrases that are synonyms of each other.  This database does
not provide definitions of words or phrases; it simply groups
them.  Command `synonym-definition' (aka `dictionary-definition')
lets you look up a word or phrase (or a regexp) using one or more
dictionaries on the Web.  That is usually the best source for this
kind of information, but you obviously need an Internet connection
to use this command.

Options (variables) `synonyms-dictionary-url' and
`synonyms-dictionary-alternate-url' are URLs you can set to point
to the dictionaries of your choice.  The default value of
`synonyms-dictionary-alternate-url' looks up the search term in
multiple dictionaries, and it lets you use wildcards.  Use `C-h v
synonyms-dictionary-alternate-url' for more information.  The
default value of `synonyms-dictionary-url' usually provides a
quicker answer.  Both of these URLs also give you access to
additional information about the search term (antonyms, etymology,
even pronunciation).

In buffer `*Synonyms*', you can simply hit `d' followed by `RET' or
`mouse-2' to look up a term that is in the buffer.  Just as for
looking up a synonym by clicking `mouse-2', if you select text
(region), then that text is looked up.
