See WikiModes if you are looking for a mode to edit a local wiki.

== This is the Emacs Wiki =

This page has meta information, traditionally called a colophon, about the Emacs Wiki.  See the SiteMap
for entry points.

* See the HowTo page for information on editing existing pages or adding new ones.
* See the MissionStatement for author guidelines.
* See UserName for information about the usernames used.
* See the EmacsLogo for information about the logo this site is using.
* See [[CSS]] for some very simple themes to choose from.
* See EmacsWikiAppearance for how to create a user cascading style sheet if you don't like the defaults.
* See [[Privacy]] to learn about the cookie this site uses and how your IP number or hostname is tracked.

We talk about Emacs and the wiki on the EmacsChannel.

== Hosting =

AlexSchroeder is the administrators of this wiki. It is hosted by Alex in Switzerland.

The first edit (see the first entry of the [Self:action=rc;all=1;from=1;showedit=1;rcidonly=SiteMap complete change log for SiteMap] was made in **2001-05-14**. The [http://web.archive.org/web/20010610005205/http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl Internet Archive Wayback Machine agrees] and has a snapshot for **2001-06-09**.

The Emacs Wiki is located at http://www.emacswiki.org/.
This is a virtual hosting environment, therefore you need to use HTTP/1.1 to access the site.

== Backups =

Help make distributed backups.
This will help us get the wiki back up and running if it goes down.
See WikiDownload for more.

A cron job backs the site up on a regular basis.
Use the [[Rsync repository]] to access our online backup.
Contact JonathanGonzalez if you ever need access to the backup and the rsync server is down.

== Money =

At the moment Alex is paying for the server.

[new]
There will not
be any ads on emacswiki.org; I hate them myself.  If you like the site
and want to contribute something, contribute either time or money:
Write content, fix typos, clean up pages by removing old discussions,
merging and splitting pages, and linking up and down the page
hierarchy.  If you do not have time, you can always donate money.
Show your support by saying on your homepage on this wiki how much you
donated to charity because of the Emacs Wiki.  That would be
awesome.

== Administrators =

Anybody willing to share administrator duties on this wiki?
See EmacsWikiAdministrators.

== Wiki Engine =

This wiki runs [[Oddmuse]].

* [Self:action=version modules installed]
* [https://www.emacswiki.org/config config] for Oddmuse
* [https://www.emacswiki.org/light.css light.css] ([https://github.com/bburns/emacswiki-light-theme source])
* [https://www.emacswiki.org/outliner.0.5.0.62-toc.js outliner.0.5.0.62-toc.js],
  a very old piece of Javascript to generate the table of contents,
  based on [https://github.com/h5o/h5o-js h5o-js]

Cron jobs:

* one job to run [https://www.emacswiki.org/maintenance/ maintenance] 
* one job to make a backup to the [[Rsync repository]]
* one job to push commits to the [[Git repository]]

Using a wiki engine written in Lisp or Scheme would have been more in
the spirit of Emacs and XEmacs, but Perl is ubiquitous, and
Oddmuse is easy to install.

Please note bugs on the [[Problems]] page.
