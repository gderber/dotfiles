I've been mucking around with Emacs since around 1985 or 1986 on a VAX-11/780 running 4.2 BSD at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, USA.

These days (ca. 2012) I live in Round Rock, Texas and work for IBM, where I use GNU Emacs on AIX and Linux, and at home on Windows XP.

Hi, dave.  Last week, i installed Sun Studio 12 on my Solaris 10(running on ultra20m) and found that xemacs has been came together. Is there any reason why xemacs was choosed not emacs ? I'm feeling like that you know the reason. :)

Hi. I used and adjusted (have a look :)) your code XEmacs for ErcHighlightNicknames. Even worked for Emacs. I hope it still works in XEmacs. --AndreRiemann
