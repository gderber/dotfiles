Perl mode helps you write [PerlLanguage Perl] code.  Since the Perl syntax is very hairy,
Perl mode has to work extra hard to try and avoid messing up syntax hilighting.

Historically, CPerlMode did a much better job, but nowadays PerlMode should work fine in most cases.

== font-lock problems ==

If you are having problems because lone apostrophes (') confuse Perl mode,
add a #' at the end of the offending line.  That helps a lot.

If you are having problems with perldoc comments in Emacs 20, remember
that font-lock operates only on lines.  Font-locking will be correct
when you open the file, but you can mess it up.  Use `M-g' to
refontify the current block of code.  That should fix most problems.

If you see no colors at all, maybe you have font-lock switched off?
In Emacs, try `M-x global-font-lock-mode'.  If that helps, add the
following to your ~/.emacs file:

 (global-font-lock-mode 1)
