Cua-mode is part of GnuEmacs versions 22.1.1 and later (at least).

Cua-mode allows one to use `C-v', `C-c', and `C-x' to paste, copy, and cut the region.  Since this conflicts with very important keybindings in Emacs, these CUA bindings are only active when the [[mark]] is active. The package does a whole lot more, too: `C-z' to undo, Shift-movement to select, and it includes support for '''rectangular regions''' (`C-RET' and arrow keys instead of using the `C-x r ...' keys) and [[register]]s (instead of using the register commands), and it uses `<tab>' and `S-<tab>' to indent and outdent the region. As you can see, it is very powerful!

*Note*: If region is not active -- no visible selection -- then `C-x' works as it as it does normally in Emacs (without cua-mode).
 
On the other hand if the region is active you can use C-S-x (or two rapid C-x C-x) instead C-x to do what C-x normally does in Emacs.
The same goes for the other CUA keys. 

More information on Cua-mode is in the Gnu-Emacs manual [[Manual:CUA Bindings]].

*Note:* If you have an Emacs version which does not have it, you must obtain cua.el (see Kim Storm's page http://www.cua.dk/). To see if Cua is built into your Emacs try ##M-x cua-mode##. Cua-mode seems not to be part of X-Emacs and at least for recent XEmacs-versions cua-mode.el seems to be broken -- see *Note 4*.

== Activating Cua-mode ==

For GNU Emacs versions above 22.1: 
* Select the CUA style from the Options menu and save the Options. 
* Or add this to ##~/.emacs##(the last three are optional):

    (cua-mode t)
    (setq cua-auto-tabify-rectangles nil) ;; Don't tabify after rectangle commands
    (transient-mark-mode 1) ;; No region when it is not highlighted
    (setq cua-keep-region-after-copy t) ;; Standard Windows behaviour

When cua.el is used:
* Put the file somewhere in your LoadPath and add the following to your ##~/.emacs## file:

    (require 'cua)
    (CUA-mode t)

* Note, the CUA mode integrated into Emacs 22.1(and newer) does not get along with cua.el. Use one or the other.

If you like the rectangle support, global mark mode, and other features, but prefer the standard Emacs keys, add:

    (cua-selection-mode t)

or, if using cua.el, add ##(CUA-mode 'emacs)## instead of ##(CUA-mode t)##

*Note 0*. There are fixes for CuaModeTerminalProblems.

*Note 1*. An alternative to cua-mode might be CuaLightMode.

*Note 2*. See CopyAndPaste for a discussion on Cua-mode and related subjects.

*Note 3*. See CuaAndIsoTransl for a comment on the order or cua-mode and iso-transl in .emacs.

*Note 4*. A much more primitive cua-mode.el for XEmacs is also available from Kim Strom's site (www.cua.dk), written by SL Baur, but it is currently broken. see http://groups.google.com/groups?q=cua-mode+%2B+xemacs&hl=en&rnum=4&selm=88h0hm%24qtb%241%40pheidippides.axion.bt.co.uk
