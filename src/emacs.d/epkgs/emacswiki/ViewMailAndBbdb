Hooking BBDB (See BbdbMode) into VM is straightforward. It should be
sufficient to:

    (require 'bbdb)
    (bbdb-initialize)
    (bbdb-insinuate-vm)

The abbreviated form is this:

    (require 'bbdb)
    (bbdb-initialize 'vm)

To get BBDB to send mail using VM, use:

    (setq bbdb-send-mail-style 'vm)

The define mail-aliases for the records which have them, use:
    
    (bbdb-define-all-aliases)
    
[new]

Can somebody please rewrite the section about `bbdb-define-all-aliases'?  It's not worded clearly, and doesn't say why someone would want to do this.  Does it even belong in the ViewMail section of the wiki? --JohnFoerch
