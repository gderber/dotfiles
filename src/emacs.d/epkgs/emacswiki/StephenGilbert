I'm a novice Emacs user, and I hope to poke around EmacsWiki a bit.

I noted your point about using Emacs on http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedicated_Wikipedia_editor
-- did you read about SimpleWikiMode already?  That is what
I currently use.  I am sure it would be trivial to fix the regexps
to hilight Wikipedia-style links. -- AlexSchroeder
