== Introduction ==

Emacs-w3m provides persistent browsing sessions, and crash recovery.
When quitting w3m (or, if you request
it, at any other time while using it) you can save the current w3m
session (that is, the set of open tabs and the URLs they're
visiting). Upon restarting emacs-w3m (possibly after restarting Emacs
itself) you'll have the possibility of recovering the saved session
(that is, of re-opening the saved tabs and URLs). You also have at
your disposal a command to recover the saved session at any other
time.

Emacs-w3m also keeps current "crash recovery" session information,
so that should you experience any form of crash, the next time you
start emacs-w3m it will prompt you to restore that session.

For each stored session, you can selectively load single tabs, rename
any single tab or the session itself, or delete a tab or the session itself.

== Usage ==

Using the default keybindings, `M-S' stores the current session, `M-s' opens
the session list, and pressing `M-s' a second time inspects the contents
of the session at point.

At any point, `d' will delete the current entry, `r' will rename it, and
pressing `return' will load it. Loading is non-destructive, ie. it only adds
new tabs, and does not replace any.

== Session tab history ==

The saved session information includes a simplified history for each tab,
so upon restoring a session you can also navigate to prior pages.

== Customization ==

Refer to the w3m customization group.
