For me there are opening parentheses missing for the toplevel special forms. So defun and define-generic-mode are missing their opening parenthesis while put, add-hook, etc. have them. Looks like

  (add-hook 'latex-mode-hook (lambda () (reftex-mode 1)))

but here the '(' is missing:

  defun my-latex-m-to-ft ()
    "Tranform meters to feet.
  \\unit[3]{m} turns to \\unit[10]{Fuss}."
    (interactive)
  ...

Thanks for spotting it. I fixed the problem yesterday but didn't regenerate (edit) the page so that the erroneous output was left in the HTML cache.
