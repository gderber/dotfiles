Can this be made to work without entering a passphrase each time it is used?  
After setting it up, it works fine for me for a little while, but then eventually asks for a 
passphrase for PLSTORE (...oauth2.plstore).  I'm not even sure what the passphrase 
is or should be.

When you first use GoogleContacts you are asked to paste an oauth2 token into the emacs minbuffer. Then you're asked to enter a passphrase. It's not obvious, but here you are creating a new passphrase to encrypt the oauth2 token with. If you enter the same passphrase next time you're asked, GoogleContacts will work. This happens because GoogleContacts uses [https://github.com/emacsmirror/oauth2/blob/master/oauth2.el oauth2.el], which stores authentication information in a GPG encrypted file using [https://github.com/emacsmirror/gnus/blob/master/lisp/plstore.el plstore.el].

If you do not want to have to enter your password for every google-contacts lookup you need to set [tt]plstore-cache-passphrase-for-symmetric-encryption[/tt] to [tt]t[/tt].  I've added this to my Emacs config (since I use [tt]use-package[/tt]):

    (use-package plstore
      :defer t
      :config (setq plstore-cache-passphrase-for-symmetric-encryption t))
