Modes that allow you to easily create and edit tables. A table is consists of a number of text fragments called cells arranged in rows and columns. Table editing should make it easy to edit only a single cell, move from cell to cell, create and kill entire rows and columns, and so on.

* TableMode the big table editing mode.
* OrgMode contains a minor mode which you can use independently. Activate it using `M-x orgtbl-mode'. Org Table Minor Mode allows formulas and integrates the [[Calc]], but recalculation of all formulas is not automatic.
* SimpleEmacsSpreadsheet (SES) is even more focused on doing what a spreadsheet should do. Formulas and automatic recalculation are included.
* ArrayMode comes with Emacs but is extremely primitive.
* TransposeParagraphAsTable will treat any paragraph in a document as a space-separated text table and transpose and align it.
