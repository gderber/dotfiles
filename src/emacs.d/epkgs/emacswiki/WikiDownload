Here is how to download the wiki:

* [[Git repository]] of the raw EmacsWiki pages. Every change on the Emacswiki is checked in individually. Also contains branches for individual packages with intact history. Great in every regard ;-)

* [[Rsync repository]] -- help making decentralized backups of the entire setup. Great for mirrors, forks, and the like.

* DownloadPartOfWiki -- download a small part of Emacs Wiki, using `wget'. Tricky.

All repositories are read-only.
