== Using Magit to Cherry Pick Parts of a GIT Commit ==

I work a lot with GIT, both professionally and privately.  Much of the work
goes into maintaining different branches of code.  When you want to port bug
fixes you can use the cherry-pick mechanism to pick commits from, e.g., your
master branch to an older branch.

However, developers do not always leave commits neatly portable and sometimes
also mixes in other minor fixes and changes.  So simply cherry-picking the
complete commit is sometimes not possible.

Usually developers sigh and simply manually port patches by using an editor
or diff/patch tools.  This page exists to ease this task.

Take a look at these two web pages:

* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1526044/partly-cherry-picking-a-commit-with-git
* http://psung.blogspot.no/2008/12/magit.html

From a terminal

    git cherry-pick -n <commit>   # get your patch, but don't commit (-n = --no-commit)
    git reset                     # unstage the changes from the cherry-picked commit
    git add -p                    # make all your choices (add the changes you do want)
    git commit                    # make the commit!

With Magit you can cherry-pick an entire commit as follows:
* 'M-x magit-status' to enter open a Magit buffer
* 'b v' to list current branches
* select branch to receive patch, RET to checkout
* 'l rl' to list patches from this branch to the branch with the cherries (or l rL, long diff) (M-x magit-log-ranged)
* select the patch to cherry-pick
* 'A' to bring the patch onto the current branch

In Emacs you can select just part of a commit using the following
commands (from a 'M-x magit-status' buffer):

* 'x' to reset to previous commit (defaults to HEAD^) (M-x magit-reset-head)
* 'u' to unstage unwanted changes (after selecting in status buffer)
* 'c' to commit again
