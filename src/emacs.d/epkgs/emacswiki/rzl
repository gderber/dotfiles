= Raziel =

Hay, it's me, it's my name. I'm Raziel (rzl for short), aka Emanuele Santoro ;-)

My homepage is at [[http://santoro.tk|http://santoro.tk]] -- yeah, 
it's all been made with GNU Emacs 23 and OrgMode ;-)

My wiki (yes, OddMuse :-P) is at 
[[http://wiki.santoro.tk|http://wiki.santoro.tk]], and my 
codes are at [[http://git.santoro.tk|http://git.santoro.tk]].

Yes, my pages are in italian at the moment (2010-1-30), but i'll 
translate them to english one day of theese, stay (s)tuned ;-)

**What** about me, though?

I'm a young GNU/Emacs user, i use it as primary editor and environment
 for many thinks like programming (in java too), reading man pages, 
surfing the web, reading news, listening to music (yeah, it's my primary
audio player).

I do emacs programming, although very basic: i'm not a fanatic which 
spends all his life on emacs, but i write all those little codes that 
make me working faster and make emacs work smoother :)

I'll post my .emacs, maybe :)
