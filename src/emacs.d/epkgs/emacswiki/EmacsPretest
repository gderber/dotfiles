Before a new release the Emacs maintainers make a "pretest" release of the EmacsDevelopmentSources.  There are binary packages for pretests available to Windows users, but otherwise its just a source package -- see BuildingEmacs.

These binaries are packaged as given by "make install", so they don't bundle binaries of optional external libraries.  See [1] for instructions on setting up a runtime environment with those libraries.
