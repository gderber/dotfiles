== Monitor Lists of Files or Command Output ==

Package to keep track of a list of specified files or the output of specified
commands.  See the code Lisp:analog.el.

The principal variable to modify is `analog-entry-list', which should be set to
a list of entries. This can be modified with:

    M-x customize-variable RET analog-entry-list RET

Each element of `analog-entry-list' is a list where the <code>car</code> is a
file (or command) and the <code>cdr</code> is an association list of
properties.

By default, entries are files, but commands can also be specified.  Each entry
can have a list of attributes describing whether the head or the tail of the
output is wanted, how many lines should be kept, a list of regexps to keep or
flush etc.  Entries can be collected into named groups.
