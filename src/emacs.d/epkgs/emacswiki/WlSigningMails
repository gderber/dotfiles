Signing Mails with WanderLust is used as a security procedure. This helps to the receiver of the e-mail to confirm the identity of the sender and also that the message hasn't been altered during transmission.

There are two procedures to follow when you want to sign and verify a signature assuming that you already has your private and public key, and the public key of the reciever:

* Inline signing: Put the signature inline showing which region of the text is signed and following the signature.
* Attached signature: Write the whole contents of the e-mail, and the signatures goes attached to it.

== Inline Signing ==

=== Using EasyPG ===
EasyPG is an easy and complete option for managing keys and for encrypting/decrypting and signing/verifying. 

For signing, you just has to select all the region you want to sign and type M-x epa-sign-region. 

For verifying, you can select the region and call M-x epa-verify-region.


Also, you can use the <code>epa-mail-mode</code>, a minor mode that offers some key binding. 

For signing, press <code>C-c C-e s</code> for sign all the contents of the message.

For verifying, position the cursor in the signed region and press <code>C-c C-e v</code>.


=== Other Tools === 
There are other tools that you can use later I'll complete the page.

== Attached Signature ==
If you want to sign an e-mail, but you want the original message easy to read, this is the recomended behaviour.
Some people recomend this way for signing an e-mail.


Using <code>mime-edit-set-sign</code> and pressing "y" for accepting, Mime-edit will attach a signature for all the text contents.

For verifying, clic on the header of the mime attach or position the cursor and call <code>M-x mime-preview-play-current-entity</code> and will appear a little buffer with the result of the signature check.
