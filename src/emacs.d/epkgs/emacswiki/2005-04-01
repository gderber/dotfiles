Emacs wiki is looking for a new owner.

After alex has switched to Mac OSX [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/alex/2005-02-08_Gadgets],
he has been slowly  "moving away" from Emacs[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/alex/Comments_on_2005-03-08_Software].

Today I received a mail from him stating that he doesn't want to administrate the emacswiki anymore
 and asking me if I would like to become the new owner of the site.

Unfortunately I'm not able to assume this responsability so if someone feels that she has enough resources to do so
please send a mail asap to mailto:alex@emacswiki.org.
