Use the search text box at the top of every page to search the wiki.  This will use DuckDuckGo to search the wiki for you.

To search for an exact phrase, enclose it in double-quotes -- example: ##"bottom of every page"##.

You can also use Perl regular expressions on the [[Search]] page.  However, this is _much_ slower.

== Other Ways of Finding Pages ==

* [EmacsWiki:action=index All Pages] including page count, and all pages as [EmacsWiki:action=index;raw=1 plain text]
* [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?action=random Random Page] is a good place to start reading and improving the site.
* FirefoxQuickSearch tells you how to set up Firefox to search the wiki.
