Css-palette is a minor mode that lets one define 'palettes' of colours
inside a block comment of a css file, and 'variables' inside comments
throughout the css file, so that you can easily insert and update colours over the whole file,
switching entire colour designs with a few keystrokes, and have a nice
overview of all colours at the top of your file. It can import and export GIMP .gpl palette files.

The user can define different kinds of `palettes' (as an example, a
`file palette' declaration is included to have all url()'s variable).

Depends on CssColor and is part of [NxhtmlMode nXhtml] since version 1.75 of that distribution.

See also GplMode for font-locking and simple editing of Gimp Palettes.
