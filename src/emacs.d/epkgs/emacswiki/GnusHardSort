If you prefer to view articles sorted by date, you may be annoyed
that articles moved from another group will appear after the
previously existing articles, even if the moved articles are
older. You can always sort your view of the articles by date, but
that may take a significant amount of time if there are a large
number of articles in the group. In addition, your default view
when you enter the summary buffer next time will continue to show
the moved articles out of order. This function permanently resorts
the articles in the group by date, by first sorting the articles,
then respooling the articles back into the same group.
