Lisp:find-dired++.el

find-dired++ is a modified version of find-dired in order to fix an issue I encountered. 

The current find-dired surrounds the filename with quotes (") and replace the home 
path with "~"; this creates an issue while running shell commands which doesn't interpret
the symbol "~".

This version leaves the quotes, but call the shell command with the full path instead.
