Modes/functions/packages to hide stuff by other means than using OutlineMode (see CategoryOutline).

* BasicNarrowing -- Restrict actions, including viewing, to a
specified region of the buffer.
* FoldingMode -- Folds buffers based on special comments containing {{{ and }}}.

* HideSearch -- hides non-matching lines incrementally
* HideShow -- Hide parts of the buffer like an outline mode.
* MultipleNarrowings -- Use `##C-x n x x x...##â€™ to cycle a ring of narrowings (buffer restrictions).
* NarrowIndirect -- Indirect buffers cloned and narrowed from other buffers let you view different portions in different windows, modes, etc.
* RevealNextTextMode -- progressively hide or show text after [[point]].
