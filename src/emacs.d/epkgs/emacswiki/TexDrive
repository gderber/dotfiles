TexDrive is an emacs minor mode which makes including TeX-style mathematical formulae in HTML-documents easy.

==Example==
If you want to include the famous Bayes' Theorem, in texdrive-mode you simply type:

  M-x texdrive-insert-formula
  Formula: $P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)\over{P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\overline{A})P(\overline{A})}$
  Title: bayes-theorem

The following is inserted:

   <img src="bayes-theorem.png" title="bayes-theorem"
        class="texdrive-formula" name="$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\overline{A})P(\overline{A})}$"
        border="0">

Now, all we need to do is 
  texdrive-generate-images-from-html
and bayes-theorem.png will be generated.

==How it works==
TexDrive scans your HTML-page for ##*<img ...>*##-elements with formulae (as in the example); it extracts the formula, feeds it to !LaTeX and converts the result into a png-file.
