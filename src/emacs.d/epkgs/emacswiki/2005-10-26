The GnuEmacs developers are trying[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-pretest-bug/2005-10/msg00210.html] to determine what to do concerning bug reports and complaints[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-pretest-bug/2005-10/msg00253.html] related to syntax highlighting of Perl source files viewed in Emacs.  The relevant code in PerlMode for EmacsFromCVS is less than satisfactory for the developers who also have doubt[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-pretest-bug/2005-10/msg00252.html] there is any workable solution before the next release.
