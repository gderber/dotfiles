Is it possible to to add Brackets (brackets.io) style quick edit to Emacs?
  - the main advantage is that it doesn't interrupt flow of thoughts - say if you are working a the main function logic, jumping to a called function definition and jump back will interrupt flow of thoughts - whereas edit it 'inline' - a small popup 'inline' windows will locate the function being called /under the cursor?

Probably it wouldn't be difficult, let's see: 

    (at-cursor-functionp
        (let 
            (p (locate-buffer-line-function current-point))
            (if (car p) ; returned list, first is true/false
                (open-side-buffer-with (cdr p))
                (warning-mini-buffer "could not locate the function")
            (`p)))
           
                                 
; to locate-buffer-line-function shall be easy utilizing existing lib
; such as in speedbar etc
; however, for function defined in other files, or lang such as ruby, it
    might be harder to implement



sorry for my gibberish in elisp, some expert to help?
