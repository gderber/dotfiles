If you have vi users switching to Emacs, consider adding something like
this to your site-wide configuration file:

    (defconst wq "This is not vi!  Use C-x C-c instead.")
    (defconst w "This is not vi!  Use C-x C-s instead.")
    (defconst q! "This is EMACS not vi!  Use C-x C-c instead.")
    (defconst wq! "This is EMACS not vi!  Use C-x C-c instead.")

Now when people type ESC :wq or ESC :q!, and hit RET impatiently when
the command they think they've just executed hasn't, they get these
helpful messages instead.

This works because `ESC :' allows you to evaluate lisp expressions.
Thus, `ESC : wq RET' will evaluate the wq variable -- which has been
set to a helpful string.
