I've been fiddling with the Apache rewrite rules again, and I've discovered a new option for the Google Custom Search we're using:

    [ ] Include all pages whose address contains this URL
    [ ] Include just this specific page or URL pattern I have entered
    [X] Dynamically extract links from this page and add them to my search engine
        [X] Include all pages this page links to
        [ ] Include all partial sites this page links to
        [ ] Include all sites this page links to 

And I've picked the [Self:action=index;pages=on;permanentanchors= index of all pages] as the URL to use.
Let's see how it goes. :)

When searching for a word, I get no result whereas it used to have
page matching in the past.

I'm not sure what this is about. I just typed "##icicles##" into the search field and it came up with only 5 pages, and the entries for those pages seem to start with random parts that include "##icicles##", not the first occurrences. I searched for "##"icicles-cmd.el"##" (with and without double-quotes, and it found no matches. Perhaps I'm missing the point, but it doesn't seem as useful as before -- far too many pages missed. -- DrewAdams

Indeed this is worse. Please revert. -- NielsGiesen

Another data point: I searched for "bidi" "bidirectional" and "right-to-left", looking for bidi stuff. I got only one hit: NielsGiesen. But I thought there was more about bidi than that on the wiki. -- DrewAdams

Let's observe this for a while. Perhaps the search engine just has to spider our site again, which might take some time given that we have several thousand pages... -- Alex

I wonder if that is the problem. You can search this site using

  site:emacswiki.org ...

Still no good result today. -- XavierMaillard

Any chance you could, at least for now, put this experimental thing somewhere else and restore the original search -- which works ;-)? IOW, please at least provide some search that works, somewhere.

BTW, I tried searching again for `icicles', and instead of 5 pages I now get only one: [[Grail]]. -- DrewAdams

I agree with DrewAdams I did another search request and got no match. -- XavierMaillard

Well, I changed the Apache rewrite rules so that the wiki uses %%http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs%% instead of %%http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki%% per default. The old search was basically a Google search with results limited to matching %%http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/*%%. I want to change that to %%http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/*%% because as Google reindexes the site all the links (and thus all the page ranking) will switch to the new pattern.

In order to get out of this impasse I now set it to use both filters:

* %%emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/*%% (this one being the one that has good data)
* %%emacswiki.org/wiki/*%%
* %%emacswiki.org/emacs/*%% (this one being the one that I really want)

I also installed a [http://emacswiki.org/scripts/sitemap cronjob] that produces a [http://www.sitemaps.org/ Sitemap] listing all our pages. Hopefully this will guide search engines in the right direction.

Also, feel free to take a look at the [http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=004774160799092323420:6-ff2s0o6yi Emacs Wiki Search] page @ Google. It says that other people can get access to the search engine configuration. Please _sign up_ and help keep it up to date.
