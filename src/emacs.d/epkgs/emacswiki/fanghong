Hi! In the Wikipedia my name is 方洪渐 and fanghong, not my real name of course, but for severial weeks I cannot reach Wikipedia and I find this emacs. I donnot know what to do and just to build some Chinese page. 

: Thanks for the translations!  :)
  If you look at [[创建别名页面]] you'll see that the permanent anchors were
  already defined elsewhere (on the HowTo page).  You will have to replace
  them with a chinese name as well.  The names of permanent anchors are like
  page names: There can only be one definition on the entire wiki.
