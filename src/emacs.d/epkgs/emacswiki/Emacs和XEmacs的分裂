There seems to be no voice from the GNU Emacs camp on the issue.

I guess people have better things to do than throwing insults -- not even in private, let alone in code -- and prefer implementation to propaganda.  Please don't believe generally all the bad stuff attributed to rms (and other contributors) without evidence; not that anyone thinks he's perfect.  Much that has been written on this topic, e.g. in the references above, is wrong or misleading from my personal experience -- some of it demonstrably so.  Some things correctly attributed to rms, for which he has been maligned, seem to have held up well in retrospect.
