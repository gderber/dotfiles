== apt-upgrade.el ==

A simple mode for Debian users to help them select what packages to upgrade via "apt-get".

Can hide libraries, minor version changes (1.0.0-X -> 1.0.0->Y), shows ChangeLog, highlights "interesting" packages.  Useful if you like to ponder about upgrading a package instead of just upgrading everything. :-)

Needs apt-utils.el, browse-url.el and sudo (for starting apt-get as non-root).
