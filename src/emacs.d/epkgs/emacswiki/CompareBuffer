== Comparing and merging a buffer with the underlying file ==

Sometimes you might be in a situation where the file underlying your buffer changes (like if it's in a directory synced with dropbox). To compare with the underlying file you can use
* diff-buffer-with-file
and if you want to merge the buffer with the file you can use
* ediff-current-file
