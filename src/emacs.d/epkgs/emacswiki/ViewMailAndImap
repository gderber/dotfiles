No matter whether you use local folders or server folders, VM wants
you to specify the IMAP server info in this format

      imap:HOST:PORT:MAILBOX:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD

So what are all those code words out there?

<code>imap</code> is server type you are using.  If your server
administrator wants to you to use "imap over SSL" then you write
<code>imap-ssl</code> instead.  ("SSL" is the secure sockets layer of
Internet communication, which sends data in an encrypted form so that
third parties can't snoop around.)

<code>HOST</code> is the server address such as
<code>pop.yahoo.com</code> or <code>pop.gmail.com</code>.

<code>PORT</code> is the port number on which you talk to the server.
For <code>imap</code>, it is normally 143.  
For <code>imap-ssl</code>, it is normally 993.  If your server
administrator wants you to use some other port number, they should tell
you.

<code>MAILBOX</code> is the mailbox or folder that this long-winded
phrase is referring to.  For the main folder, you use
<code>inbox</code>.  When you need to talk about the entire IMAP
account without referring to any folder in particular, you use
<code>*</code>. 

<code>AUTH</code> is the "authentication" method, normally
<code>login</code>.  If your server administrator wants you to use
something else, they should tell you.  Look up in the VM manual how to
implement the other methods.  (They are not as straightforward as the
<code>login</code> method.)

<code>USER</code> is your user name.

<code>PASSWORD</code> is your password.  Normally, you put
<code>*</code> here and VM understands that you don't want to throw
around your passwords.  It will prompt you to enter it in the
minibuffer.

Phew!  

== Examples ===

     (setq vm-imap-account-alist
           '(
             ("imap-ssl:mail.foocorp.com:993:*:login:becky:*" "becky")
             ("imap:crickle.lex.ky.us:143:*:login:becky:*" "crickle")
            )
     )

Becky is trying to use two IMAP accounts, one at
<code>mail.foocorp.com</code> which is using a secure protocol
(<code>imap-ssl</code>).  She wants to call this account
"<code>becky</code>".  The second account at
<code>crickle.lex.ky.us</code> is using an insecure communication
protocol.  She is calling it "<code>crickle</code>".  Note that the
<code>MAILBOX</code> part in both the cases is <code>*</code>.  (Becky
is naming the entire IMAP accounts, not any particular folders.)
She can look at her inbox at her work account by typing:

     M-x vm-visit-imap-folder RET becky:inbox RET

and she can look at her "finances" folder at cricke by typiong:

     M-x vm-visit-imap-folder RET becky:finances RET

If she wants to use her inbox at work account as the main inbox, she
can put in her .vm file:

    (setq vm-primary-inbox "imap-ssl:mail.foocorp.com:993:inbox:login:becky:*")

This refers to the <code>inbox</code> folder on foocorp,
specifically.  We can't use <code>*</code> as the <code>MAILBOX</code>
here.  Once this is done, she can just use <code>M-x vm</code> to read
her inbox at work.


== IMAP as mail spool ==

If you want to download your mail to a local folder and delete it from
the server, you can do so by specifying
<code>vm-spool-files</code>. This can be configured using, for
example:

    (add-to-list 'vm-spool-files
                 '("~/mail/IMAP-INBOX"
                   "imap-ssl:HOST:PORT:MAILBOX:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD"
                   "~/mail/IMAP-INBOX.CRASH"))

If <code>PASSWORD</code> is given as *, it will be prompted for the
first time that mail is retrieved.

To delete the messages from the server after downloading, put this in
your .vm file:

    (setq vm-imap-expunge-after-retrieving t)

If you want to control this on per-mailbox basis, you can configure
<code>vm-imap-auto-expunge-alist</code>.

Other variables controlling IMAP spool files include:

    vm-imap-bytes-per-session
    vm-imap-max-message-size
    vm-imap-messages-per-session
