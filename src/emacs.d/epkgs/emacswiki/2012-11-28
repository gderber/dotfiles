Some questions regarding new features for EmacsWiki based on [[Comments on 2012-03-22]]. *Just edit this page and add a link to your Username in the appropriate section.* Feel free to leave [[Comments on 2012-11-28]].

[[Oddmuse:EditSection_Module|Editing page sections]]: There is an extension to edit sections of a page. I haven't been using it on any other site, so I fear some bit rot. Nevertheless it might be useful for very long pages that we don't want to break up into smaller sections.

[[Oddmuse:Template_Extension|Templates for new pages]]: We can have new pages start with content from a template page. I haven't been using it on any other site, so I fear some bit rot. It might be useful if we have a lot of pages that always have the same structure. We could have a template each for major modes, user pages, etc.

[[Oddmuse:Live_Template_Extension|Templates for page sections]]: We can have a special text formatting rule that pulls in content from a template page, replaces some named parameters and includes the resulting wiki text in our current text. I haven't been using it on any other site, so I fear some bit rot. It might be useful if we have a lot of pages that always have a section that they share. We could have a template each for major modes, for example. We could also have a template for packages that belong to a major group such as Icicles, rcirc, ERC, and so on. In order to produce nice sidebars this would also require some additions to the CSS.

*Export as PDF*: Some people might not have a PDF printer installed (it comes included with Mac OS 10, for example). We could add a green button at the bottom of every page which linked to a service such as [http://www.printfriendly.com/button Print Friendly].

*Popular pages*: We could implement a simple tracking that counts the pages visited and shows the most popular ones on a special page. Such an extension does not exist, yet, but it seems easy to implement.

[[Oddmuse:Flashbox_Extension|Embed video]]: There are not many videos that seem on topic, but perhaps this would be a boost for a new category? EmacsScreencasts would not link to the videos directly but to pages where the screen cast is described in more detail, and this detail page would then embed the video directly, maybe?
