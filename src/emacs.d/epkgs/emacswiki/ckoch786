I am Cory Koch, I enjoy using Emacs, and I use it every day. 
I started using Emacs in 2011 and started learning Elisp in 2013. I have used Emacs for Java/Groovy, shell, and python
as well as Elisp, Lisp development, and everything else.

I also use emacs for managing my finances, and plan on writing a 
major mode for it sometime soon.

Currently I am using it to help streamline the work that I do at my
current job. Which mainly centers around data entry into spreadsheets,
managing the different versions and moving them around. I also use
org-mode for managing the meeting minutes and am working on some
functions for moving around tasks to different lists (for instance
moving all [x] checked items to a finished list and placing them all
under a common time stamp).

I wrote [https://github.com/ckoch786/prayer-times prayer-times] for the [http://lispinsummerprojects.org/ Lisp in Summer Project] 2013. It was not
my main project but rather just something that I was hacking
together on the side and submitted so I could submit something :). I plan on participating next year as well.
