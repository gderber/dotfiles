erc-notify.el is a EmacsIrcClient module that allows you to keep track
of the online status of certain people.

Notify is not enabled by default. To enable it use <code>M-x
customize-variable RET erc-modules</code>.

You get a new /-command, <code>/notify</code>. Use it as follows:

/notify by itself lists the users online which are on your
notification list.  <code>/notify</code> ''nick [nick ...]'' toggles
that nick. Meaning, if the nick is on the list, it will get removed,
otherwise it will be added.

The status of the nicks is checked every
<code>erc-notify-interval</code> seconds, 60 by default.

Note that you can also use variable <code>erc-notify-list</code>.
