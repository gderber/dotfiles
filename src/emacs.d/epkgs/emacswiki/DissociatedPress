Disscociated Press is a semi-randomizing algorithm that takes your buffer, runs it through a
blender, and displays the result.


This "feature" can be reached through the command
 M-x dissociated-press
to run it with default settings. (C-h C-x dissociated-press has more information.)

This always has comical results. For example, I can put my literature homework into the
Dissociated Press-

{{{
 Section III. UNDERSTANDING FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE
 ...
}}}

a perfectly sensible section of homework, and it spits out something like

{{{
 Section III: UNDERSe!

 4.    "He wout
 what I had mistook for profanity i'm really say."
             --Song Of Myself, getting madder and mis

 5. "He mississississippi river."
}}}

M-x Dissociated-press works far better with longer inputs, of course.
