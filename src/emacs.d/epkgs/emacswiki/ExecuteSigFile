This is actually quite easy, add this to your .gnus

<code>(setq message-signature (lambda () (shell-command-to-string "$HOME/.signature")))</code>

If your .signature is a executable file we're finished.  If it isn't and you're on a Unix or Unix like box, use:

<code>(setq message-signature (lambda () (shell-command-to-string "cat $HOME/.signature")))</code>

: The following should work regardles of ~/ .signature being executable:

 (setq message-signature
       (lambda () 
         (shell-command-to-string
           (if (file-executable-p "~/.signature")
             "~/.signature" "cat ~/.signature"))))

But if you use a signature rotating application like <code>signify</code>, here is how to do this

<code>(setq message-signature (lambda () (shell-command-to-string "signify")))</code>
