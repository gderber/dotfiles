==Overview==

Nav-flash temporarily highlights the line containing the point,
which is sometimes useful after a navigation command.

There is no user-level interface for this library; it is only used
by other Lisp libraries.  However you might find it useful to call
nav-flash-show in your ~/.emacs file.  For example, the following
hook causes the nav-flash to appear after navigating via imenu:

   (add-hook 'imenu-after-jump-hook 'nav-flash-show nil t)

==Comparison with pulse.el==

Pulse.el provides similar functionality and is included with
Emacs.  This library can use pulse.el, but does not do so by
default, because pulse.el uses sit-for, breaking this type
of construction:

   (nav-flash-show)
   (with-temp-message "message here"
      (sit-for 2))

When using an overlay and timer for cleanup (as nav-flash does
by default) the flash and message appear simultaneously.

Nav-flash.el is also simpler than pulse.el.
