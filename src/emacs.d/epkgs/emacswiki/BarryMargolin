In a response to the question "Why emacs?" on news:comp.emacs, Barry wrote:

At the time I learned Emacs (about 1980), the only other editors on any of
the systems I used were line editors (similar to Unix's "ed").  I don't
think vi had even been invented yet; if it had, it was still very new, and
there weren't many Unix systems on the MIT campus anyway.  So if you wanted
a visual editor, Emacs was pretty much the only choice.

It has remained my preferred editor because I've encountered almost no
editors with as many built-in features.  And since it's extensible, just
about anything can be added if you need it.
