Often, when editing code, I want to change the name of some function or variable. The standard replace does not really work then, because I want to replace all occurrences. Furthermore, it would be nice if the current region or the next word was used as a starting guess of the text to be replaced.

This is what the replace-in-buffer tries to solve:
{{{
;; Replace text in whole buffer. The suggested OLD text is either the current region,
;; or the next word (as mark-word would select it). The suggested text for the
;; replacement is the same as the OLD text.
(defun replace-in-buffer ()
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (if (equal mark-active nil) (mark-word))
    (setq curr-word (buffer-substring-no-properties (mark) (point)))
    (setq old-string (read-string "OLD string:\n" curr-word))
    (setq new-string (read-string "NEW string:\n" old-string))
    (query-replace old-string new-string nil (point-min) (point-max))
    )
  )
}}}

After you are done replacing, you return back at the point where you started.
I find it quite useful, and have bound it to Ctrl-z (since emacs is not to be suspended :))
{{{
(global-set-key (kbd "C-z") 'replace-in-buffer)
}}}

this is the first thing I wrote in elisp, so please improve it if you can. -- jannis

That is some good first Lisp.

Eventually you might be happy with the Emacs [[KeyBinding]]s once you get used to them:

; Search and replace word at point:
: `M-b' runs the command backward-word
: `C-s' runs the command isearch-forward
: `C-w' runs the command isearch-yank-word
: ##`M-%'## runs the command query-replace
: ##`!'##' replaces all
: `C-x C-x' runs the command exchange-point-and-mark

; Search and replace region:
: `M-w' runs the command kill-ring-save
: `C-s' runs the command isearch-forward
: `C-y' runs the command isearch-yank-kill
: ##`M-%'##' runs the command query-replace
: ##`!'##' replaces all
: `C-x C-x' runs the command exchange-point-and-mark

See IncrementalSearch.

I find knowing the various search and replace commands of Emacs useful for adapting to the specific situation.  I had also written commands to do search and replace, but I've since thrown them out. -- AaronHawley
