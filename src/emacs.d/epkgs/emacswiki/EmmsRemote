= Emms-Remote =

Ever wanted to use emms also when not inside emacs?
Say, emms is your favourite browser but you **have** to use firefox 
or OpenOffice?

Emms comes in your rescue. It's a simple shell script, you only have to
mark it executable, put it somewhere in a directory which is in your $PATH 
variable, and bind some keyboard shortcuts to it.

Code is simple, home page is at 
[[http://wiki.santoro.tk/index.cgi/EmmsRemote|http://wiki.santoro.tk/index.cgi/EmmsRemote]].

**Note**: Although I'll try to keep this page updated, you should know
that its home page is on my wiki ([[http://wiki.santoro.tk/index.cgi/EmmsRemote|http://wiki.santoro.tk/index.cgi/EmmsRemote]]),
so, when in doubt, check it out.

Code is at [[http://git.santoro.tk/?p=emms-remote.git;a=summary|http://git.santoro.tk/?p=emms-remote.git;a=summary]].

= Dependancies =

Since emms-remote controls emms, and since emms runs in emacs, emms has to 
connect to emacs someway. The best way is, imho, emacsclient.

So, you need at least emacs22 (better if emacs23, is use version 23 in 
debian squeeze) and a server running.

= Installing =

{{{
manu@joker: ~ $ git clone http://santoro.tk/~manu/emms-remote.git
manu@joker: ~ $ cd emms-remote
manu@joker: ~ $ chmod +x emms-remote ;
manu@joker: ~ $ sudo cp emms-remote /usr/bin/
}}}

Last step is not mandatory, as you may want to install the script locally.

If you have a directory in your ~ containing all your executables, put 
`emms-remote` there.


= Binding your DE/WM to emms-remote =

This part varies depending on what window manager or desktop environment
you run. In this period, i'm using Fluxbox intensively (and it's behaving 
quite well, i have to say), so i'll post configuration for Fluxbox.

**EDIT**: I've solved cofiguration problems. They were related to PATH vars 
and executability of the emms-remote file, as i put it in my ~/.bin dir, 
which is in my $PATH now.

BTW, fluxbox conf should be something like this:

<pre>
### ~/.Bin/Emms-Remote invocation
# file: ~/.fluxbox/keys
Mod4 space :ExecCommand ~/.bin/emms-remote --toggle-pause
Mod4 Down :ExecCommand ~/.bin/emms-remote --stop
Mod4 Up :ExecCommand ~/.bin/emms-remote --start
Mod4 Right :ExecCommand ~/.bin/emms-remote --next
Mod4 Left :ExecCommand ~/.bin/emms-remote --prev
</pre>

It now fully works. And it's **wounderful**.

= Embedding into other =
As i use conky on my desktop, i also like to know what song is currently 
emms playing. So i've added a --query option.

The --query switch works well with this line in your .emacs:

<pre>
(setq emms-show-format "NP: %s")
</pre>

In my .conkyrc, theese lines solve the problem, invoking emms-remote with
the --query switch:

<pre>
$color$stippled_hr${if_running emacs}
${color}EMMS is playing:
${color}${alignc}${execi 10 ~/.bin/emms-remote --query }$endif
</pre>
