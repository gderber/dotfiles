I was trying to write an erc defun that tells me 
the top level domains of all the users on the EmacsChannel.
Here is how far I got.
It seems that the information per nick is only available if
I query for it explicitly, by sending a ''/whois''
for every nick to the server.  :/

''/who #emacs'' provides enough information.

(let ((erc-channel-users (with-current-buffer (get-buffer "#emacs") erc-channel-users))
      (hash (makehash 'equal)))
  (maphash (lambda (k v) 
	     (let ((host (erc-server-user-host (car v)))
		   (k "")
		   v)
	       (when host
		 (setq k (car (nreverse (split-string host "\\.")))))
	       (unless (string-match "[a-z]$" k)
		 (setq k "unknown"))
	       (setq v (1+ (gethash k hash 0)))
	       (puthash (downcase k) v hash)))
	   erc-channel-users)
  (maphash (lambda (k v)
	     (insert k ": " (number-to-string v) "\n"))
	   hash))
