I like to write Emacs Lisp code for various things.  I use Emacs a lot under Windows and !SunOS.

You could contact me by going to this page on SourceForge http://sourceforge.net/users/doshea/ and using the form to send me an email.  I guess it's more spam-safe than putting my email address here :)
