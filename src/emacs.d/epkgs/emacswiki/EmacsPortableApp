== For MS-Windows ==

The standard MS-Windows binaries is already portable, in that you can just unzip it anywhere and run it directly.
To keep your ##.emacs.d## in a directory called ##emacshome## on your USB stick next to the unzipped Emacs, create a ##runemacs.bat## file in Emacs' ##bin/## directory with contents:
{{{
set HOME=%~dp0..\..\emacshome
"%~dp0runemacs.exe" %*
}}}
and then use that instead of ##runemacs.exe##.
