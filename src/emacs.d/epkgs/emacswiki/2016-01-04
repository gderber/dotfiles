Two things on my mind:

# HTTPS. [https://www.eff.org/encrypt-the-web Encrypting the Web] is important. We can do it. https://www.emacswiki.org/ works thanks to [https://letsencrypt.org/ Let's Encrypt].

# A new CSS. BrianBurns has been working on a new theme.

Just wanted to add a note that the logo is just a placeholder at the moment - other designs or ideas are welcome! (the leaves are meant represent an E and W). 

There are still bits that need tweaking here and there - at some point we could open this up on the Devlist and Reddit to get more suggestions.

I think HTTPS support just got better. For the moment I want to keep both HTTP and HTTPS versions of the site up and running.
Right now, nginx should set HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO to "http" or "https" and the configuration of Emacs Wiki should
now take this into account, generating links using "http" or "https" as appropriate. If a page's raw text contains the HTTP link -- like in the paragraphs above -- then those won't change, obviously. When I make the final switch over, those will all redirect to the HTTPS version of the site.

Anyway. I've changed my bookmark to the following, using HTTPS:

With the help of ##forcer## and ##kodein## on the EmacsChannel I managed to improve the SSL Server Test score from a C to an A. Thanks!
The only thing I haven't enabled is HSTS.
I'm still waiting to see people report problems.
