Craig Finseth is the author of the text editor Freyja
("Freyja Reduces Emacs, Yet Joins All")
which is an Emacs look-alike which is especially suitable
for MS-DOS based systems with very little memory and hard disk
(it's very popular e.g. in the HP 95LX/100LX community).

He also wrote a book called "The Craft of Text Editing
-- or, Emacs for the Modern World" which is available
on the web for free (see TheCraftOfTextEditing)
and a list of Emacs implementations and derivatives,
which is by and large authoritative on the subject 
(see EmacsImplementations).

He has a home page at http://www.finseth.com/~fin/
with pointers to more information.
