I'm ijp on #emacs.

I converted to gnu emacs in 2008 or so, and haven't looked back. My .emacs is currently a > 1000 line abomination desperately in need of cleanup. Volunteers welcome.

Occasionally I send patches to [[Guile]], and would like to see [[GuileEmacs]] take off. Hopefully bipt can make it happen.

You'll often see me playing with [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel#rudybot|Rudybot]] on #emacs. What can I say? I'm a sucker for irc bots.
