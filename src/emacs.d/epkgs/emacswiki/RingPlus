* `<code>ring-insert+extend</code>' -- like `ring-insert', but if `grow-p' arg is non-nil, then enlarge the ring if it is full.
* `<code>ring-remove+insert+extend</code>' -- `ring-remove' item from ring, then `ring-insert+extend' it.
* `ring-convert-sequence-to-ring' -- convert sequence (array, list, vector, string) to a ring
