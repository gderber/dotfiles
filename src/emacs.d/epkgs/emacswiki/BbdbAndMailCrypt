IanSheldon has code out there that integrates MailCrypt with the BBDB.
Basically, it allows you to add an entry to your BBDB records to indicate if the recipient prefers PGP or GPG encrypted or signed mail.
If so, when you send the mail, it will automatically be encrypted. This has been tested with Gnus.

you can get the file with archive.org's waybackmachine, like this
