Maclisp is a dialect of [[Lisp]] developed at MIT in 1966.  It added many features that we take for granted in Lisp today: functions with variable numbers of arguments, macros, arrays, and non-local dynamic exits.  It was influential on the development of EmacsLisp, [[Scheme]], ZetaLisp and CommonLisp.  The first Scheme interpreter and the first Emacs with Lisp facilities (see MulticsEmacs) were written in MacLisp. 

The "Mac" in MacLisp stands for ProjectMac.
