This page contains info about packages of elisp files that are written to work together or are distributed together for other reasons.

Some of the files in this packages may be available from ElispArea.
The packages are perhaps also mentioned on WikifiedEmacsLispList but they do not stand out as packages there and their usefulness therefore might not be that easy to grasp.
(Also the files are not there.)

In most cases <b>these packages contains installation</b> instructions you should follow to get them to work.
If not then please see InstallingPackages.
