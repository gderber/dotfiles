EMACS and SQLITE as a rapid application development environment

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My attempt to clean up and use Cladwell's SQLite code pointed
out some major flaws in it:

* It sprays temp buffers everywhere
* It can only "connect" to a single database
* It doesn't return all the rows in the result set

In the process of fixing it, I rewrote it and added more features.
It and a demo form using Emacs widgets can be found on 
[http://www.jasonfruit.com/page/emacs_sqlite_and_widgets this page of my website].


As a temporary solution, on february of 2013 appeared a new fork of [[JasonFruit]]'s script, [[SQLite-el]]. This is because the link http://www.jasonfruit.com is broken. 
The script doesn't have all the features, but you can use it for connecting and querying. You can download it from Lisp:sqlite.el

This URL doesn't work! http://www.jasonfruit.com doesn't work :'( 
Are there any way to contact JasonFruit? Is somewhere any copy of the code?
Cheers!

I am Jason Fruit, my website is dead, and I no longer have this code.  I found this while looking for it.  Maybe I'll rewrite it.
