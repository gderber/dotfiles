Well, I've been using Emacs for long enough that I think most commands should be chained together. I started somewhere in the 80's when my father introduced me to it and the joys of cc-mode. I've been using it since for just about everything.

At the moment, my major efforts on Emacs is CSharpMode.

* http://cinki.mfgames.com/ (bugs and issues with it)
* http://forum.mfgames.com/index.php/board,14.0.html (forum)

I also have a blog at http://moonfire.us/blog/ which I update randomly about my various projects, writings (I'm also a novelist), and rants.
