<code>hangman.el</code> by EricLudlam is a version of the simple hangman word guessing game, played against the computer.  Get it from

By default words are chosen from <code>/usr/dict/words</code>.  But on most systems that file has an awful lot of obscure things, so you might want to change <code>hm-dictionary-file</code> if you've got a better word list.

Hangman version 0.1 is hurt by an incompatible change made to <code>concat</code> in Emacs 21.  In <code>hm-make-guess-string</code> the concat under the <code>t</code> case tries to concat a char to a string, which Emacs 21 broke.  It can be changed to <code>(substring string i (1+ i))</code>.  Only words with hyphens or apostrophes are affected.
