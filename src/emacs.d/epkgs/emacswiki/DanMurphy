Daniel L. Murphy invented [[TECO]], Emacs's mother.

TECO introduced the spirit and approach behind Emacs. Emacs was not simply "''implemented'' in TECO", as you sometimes hear.

What did ''Emacs'' add then?

* The idea that ''everything'' is a [[command]], including self-inserting characters. That is, every [[key]] is bound to an "editor macro".
* And (later) Lisp.
