This package provides a buffer %%*Emacs Log%%* showing the last hit keys and executed commands, messages and file loads in chronological order.  This enables you to reconstruct the last seconds of your work with Emacs.
It can also be used for presentations.

It is hosted here: https://github.com/michael-heerdegen/interaction-log.el
