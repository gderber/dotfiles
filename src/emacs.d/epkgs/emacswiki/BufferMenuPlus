Library <tt>[[buff-menu+.el]]</tt> ('''[::BufferMenu+]''') provides the following enhancements to the standard BufferMenu:

* A new column, '''Time''', which is the time that a buffer was last accessed (displayed).  Short and long time formats (option). (Emacs 22 or later.)
* You can selectively ''hide'' any of the columns '''Time''', '''Mode''', and '''File''', using user options or toggle commands.  This is useful to save horizontal space. (Emacs 22 or later.)
* You can use `##+##' and `##-##' to increase and decrease the '''Buffer''' and '''Size''' column widths. (Emacs 22 or later.)
* You can sort ''up or down'' by clicking any column heading. The sorted column and its sort order (ascending, descending) are indicated by ''highlighting'' (underlining, overlining). (Emacs 22 or later.)
* You can [[Customize|customize]] which column to sort by default using [[option]]
'''`Buffer-menu-sort-column''''.
* Clicking column heading '''CRM''' sorts the buffers by time of ''first'' access (visit). This is not the same thing as a descending sort of '''Time''', which is the time of ''last'' access (display). If you have many buffers (especially if they have similar names), sorting by one of these columns can be useful. (Emacs 22 or later.)
* You can customize the default sort column. (Emacs 22 or later.)
* Buttons in header columns are wider, so easier to click. (Emacs 22 or later.)
* A ''mouse popup menu'' (`mouse-3') was added, providing these menu items:
** '''Select Buffer'''
** '''Unmark Buffer'''
** '''Mark to Save Buffer (S)'''
** '''Mark to Delete Buffer (D)'''
** '''Mark as Modified/Unmodified (*)'''
** '''Execute: Save/Delete Marked Buffers'''
** '''Delete All <nowiki>`D'</nowiki>, Even If Modified'''
* That last `mouse-3' menu item is a new command, `Buffer-menu-delete-flagged' (bound to `C-M-x'), that deletes all buffers flagged `D', even if they are modified.
* Command `buffer-menu' was redefined so that:
** A prefix argument zero or less means list buffers ''alphabetically''.
** A prefix argument zero or more means list only ''Dired and file buffers''.
* The buffer-menu buffer (<code>*Buffer List*</code>) is font-lock ''highlighted'':
** Each field of buffer (Buffer, Mode, File etc.) uses a different [[face]].
** Each mark uses a different face (Save, Delete, Read-Only, Mark, Current). All faces (there are eleven) are user-definable (variables).
* The buffer lines have the `mouse-face' property on the whole line, so you can click it anywhere.
* Command `Buffer-menu-execute' (<code>x</code>) deletes all windows that show a buffer, when it kills the buffer.
* Command `Buffer-menu-select' (<code>v</code>) uses `pop-to-buffer' when the <code>*Buffer List*</code> window is `window-dedicated-p'.
* Bug fix: In Emacs 21, if buffer <code>*Buffer List*</code> is a special-display buffer (for instance, if you set `special-display-regexps' to match buffer names "*...*"), then you cannot revert the buffer or sort on a column by clicking its header. (This is fixed in Emacs 22.)

Here is a screenshot of the <code>*Buffer List*</code> buffer in Emacs 20:

: [[image:DrewsEmacsBufferMenu]].

Here is a screenshot of it in Emacs 22, showing the new time-last-accessed column and highlighting (underlining) of the sorted column.

: [[image:DrewsEmacsBufferMenuSorted]].

Both of these screenshots are a bit old. Now, different kinds of buffers (directory, `##*...*##' name, normal) are highlighted differently, and the buffer name is also highlighted specially when you mark or flag a buffer.

== Search All Marked Buffers using Icicles ==

With [[Icicles]], you can use '''`M-s i'''' in Buffer Menu to search all marked buffers  and possibly replace search hits.  You have
available all of the [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview|Icicles Search]] features, including accessing search hits directly, in any order.

Both ##buff-menu+.el## and recent versions (Sept. 8/2004) of ##buff-menu.el## call the function /format-mode-line/. Any ideas where it can be found? Thanks. -- SteveTaylor

I'm experiencing issues when some buffers are in some nxml-derivative mode (html, xml ...). After calling list-buffers, the "buffer list" window gets updated until first nxml-typed buffer. Gets interrupted (backtrace buffer pops up), (wrong-type-argument characterp sgml-xml-mode) at the top of the backtrace, full spit is available at http://gist.github.com/458598 . Switching back the nxml buffers to text-mode works around the issue. 
Experiencing this issue since E23.0, now at 23.2.1, I believe this may have something to do with buffer-menu+. -- elie

[new:DrewAdams:2010-06-30 13:26 UTC]
Your backtrace suggests that the problem is in `bs', not in <tt>[[buff-menu+.el]]</tt>.  The code in the backtrace is all from `bs.el', it seems.
 
<pre>
Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument characterp sgml-xml-mode)
  concat("         " (sgml-xml-mode "XHTML" "HTML"))
  (if (eq (quote right) align) (concat (make-string ... 32) string)

  (let ((length ...)) (if (>= length len) string (if ... ... ...)))
  bs--format-aux((sgml-xml-mode "XHTML" "HTML") right 12)

Something is passing ##'(sgml-xml-mode "XHTML" "HTML")## to `concat'.  It tries to process that list as a list of chars, which it is not (it is a list of a symbol and two strings). -- DrewAdams

Buffer-Menu+ does not work with Emacs 24. Anyone know of any plans to make it do so? -- ScottRandby

[new:DrewAdams:2011-12-29 07:10 UTC]
1. Emacs 24 has not been released.  I don't claim to support at present.  

2. That said, it works for me.

3. Be specific about what problem you think you see.  "''Does not work''" does not help.  Provide a recipe to reproduce the problem, preferably from ##emacs -Q##. Send a bug report by clicking the '''Send Bug Report''' link in the `Buffer-Menu-Plus' `customize-group' buffer.  -- DrewAdams

[new]
I'm very sorry for not being more specific. I downloaded v21 update 2742 of ##buff-menu+.el## and now it works perfectly. I was using v21 update 2716 and the following message appeared in the minibuffer whenever I did ##C-x C-b## from ##emacs -Q##.

<pre>
Wrong type argument: characterp, 8388640
</pre>

I am using Emacs 24 because Emacs 23.3 won't compile on Xubuntu 11.10 without a lot of work and I don't want to use the version in the repository. It would be nice if ##buff-menu+## was part of GNU Emacs. -- ScottRandby

[new]
I am using version 21.0, update 2742 of ##buff-menu+.el## on GNU Emacs 24.0.92.1. When I don't have the package loaded and do ##M-x buffer-menu## and sort the buffer menu by file, I get the following (which is what I want).

<pre>
Directory1
File1
Directory2
File2
*scratch*
*Message*
</pre>

If I load ##buff-menu+.el## and sort the buffer menu by file (ascending), I get this (which I don't want):

<pre>
File1
File2
*scratch*
*Message*
Directory1
Directory2
</pre>

Older versions of ##buff-menu+.el## that I used with Emacs 23 sorted files the first way. Has file sorting been changed? If so, is there any way that file sorting can be done the first way? -- ScottRandby

[new:DrewAdams:2012-01-05 14:19 UTC]
I cannot reproduce the problem.  If you are talking about sorting by file/dir name, then that still works (for me) the same as always: the file and dir names are sorted lexicographically (alphabetically), either ascending or descending.  File and dir names are treated the same.

Anyway, the lists you show here are ''not'' file/dir names -- they are ''buffer'' names.  By sorting by ''file'' name I assume you mean just that, which you do by clicking the '''File''' column header.

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding you.  Please elaborate/clarify.  Thx -- DrewAdams

[new]
Yes, the names are buffer names and the sort is done when I click on the '''File''' column header. So what is happening is that all the buffer names associated with files appear at the top of the list and all the buffer names associated with directories appear at the bottom of the list when ##buff-menu+.el## is loaded. Does this help? -- ScottRandby

[new:DrewAdams:2012-01-05 16:45 UTC]
1. When the library is ''loaded''? Or ''after sorting'' by file name?  Just what is the problem you mean?

2. When the library is loaded, the default sort is by last-visit time.  But this default is controlled by [[user option]] '''`Buffer-menu-sort-column'''', so you can have it start up with a sort of any of the columns.

3. When you sort by file name, it does ''not'' happen (for me, at least) that buffers associated with files are at the top and buffers associated with directories are at the bottom.  What happens is that buffers associated with files and dirs are at the top, and buffers with no file/dir are at the bottom (or vice versa, depending on whether the sort is ascending/descending).  And the buffers with a file or dir are sorted lexicographically, followed by the buffers with no file or dir, also sorted lexicographically.

4. Case is significant (respected) for sorting.  Perhaps that is what is confusing you -- perhaps your directories have a different letter case than your non-directory files?

None of this has changed in any way.  And it works the same (AFAICT) in all Emacs versions.  HTH -- DrewAdams

[new]
I will address each of your points.

1. If the library is not loaded, the sorting by file name works as it should. If I load the library and then sort by file name, then I get the weird list.

2. I have the '''Buffer-menu-sort-column''' set to 6.

3. You may get the lexicographical sort, but I am not.

4. No, the case issue isn't the problem. All my files and directories begin with capital letters.

Since you can't reproduce the problem, I don't know what to do. For now, I won't use the package. -- ScottRandby

[new:DrewAdams:2012-01-05 21:49 UTC]
a. Maybe your Emacs 24 version is different from mine.  I get the same results (same as Emacs prior to 24) with both the second Emacs 24 pretest and a later snapshot (Dec 06, 2011). 

b. '''''6''''' is not a valid value for `Buffer-menu-sort-column'.  If you were to use either Customize or `M-x set-variable' you would see that.  Customize is your friend: it does type-checking.  Valid values are '''0-5'''.  For file-name sorting, you want ''''''5''''''.

c. If that's not the problem, and if you're interested, you can try doing this:

## Load ##buff-menu.el## (not .elc).

## In the definition of `list-buffers-noselect', just before the last `dolist', insert this: ##(debug)##, then evaluate the definition using `C-M-x' (then you can remove the ##(debug)##).

## That will enter the debugger just before sorting. Use `d' to step or `c' to skip through a step.  Keep the source code open in another window to be able to follow it easily.  You should be able to see what happens -- let me know.

d. It's OK for me if you don't use the package -- I'll even give you your money back. ;-)  If you do find out more about the problem or how to reproduce it, please let me know.  Thx -- DrewAdams




[new]
When I do ##M-x customize-group## and go to the '''Buffer-menu-plus''' group, I get this:

<pre>
 Buffer-menu-sort-column: 1
    State : CHANGED outside Customize. (mismatch)
   Sorted by (1) visit, (2) buffer, (3) size, (4) time, (5) mode, (6) file. More
</pre>

So now I'm confused. But it doesn't matter, because setting ##Buffer-menu-sort-column## to 1 and then clicking on '''File''' in the buffer menu still gives the bad sorting.

I agree that the problem might stem from the version of Emacs 24 I'm using. But I don't have time right now to compile the latest version.

I will try the steps you mentioned when I have time, maybe next week. Do you mean for me to load ##buff-menu+.el## instead of ##buff-menu.el##?

I really would like to get the package working. I have a hard time using the buffer menu without the syntax highlighting. --ScottRandby


[new:DrewAdams:2012-01-06 20:46 UTC]
With patience we will find the solution. ;-)

1. What you show from the Customize buffer is very wrong.  I suspect it comes from your Emacs version, but I do not know.  The fact that it says ##(mismatch)## indicates that the current value (shown as ##STANDARD##, which means the original definition) does not have the right custom type.

And what you show indicates that the current value is `1'.  While `1' is a valid value, you should never see that in Customize.  Why?  Because the `defcustom' uses ##:tag## and ##:choice##.  What you should see is (a) a '''Value Menu''' button followed by the text ##Sort by time of last visit## or some such (that's the default choice, which corresponds to value `1').

2. The fact that it says the value was ##CHANGED outside Customize## indicates that you are not starting with ##emacs -Q## or that you have already somehow changed the value, without using Customize.

3. Vanilla ##buff-menu.el## defines the same variable, but using a `defvar', not `defcustom', so it is not a [[user option]] there.  The `defcustom' in ##buff-menu+.el## should override the `defvar' in ##buff-menu.el##.  Perhaps that is not happening, for some reason.  (Both libraries provide `1' as the default value.)

4. "''But it doesn't matter, because setting ##Buffer-menu-sort-column## to 1 and then...''" --- How are you setting it?  If you use Customize, it must show you the '''Value Menu''' button and you must use that to choose.  If you use `M-x set-variable', that too should work.  Even ##(setq Buffer-menu-sort-column 1)## should work.  But it sounds like something is broken in your setup or your Emacs version.  Or perhaps you are doing more than you say, perhaps not starting with ##emacs -Q## or something.

5. You need only put ##buff-menu+.el## in your `load-path' and load it (using ##(require 'buff-menu+)## in your [[init file]] or `##M-x load-library buff-menu+##' interactively).  It will automatically load ##buff-menu## first.

Please take another look, and let me know.  Thx -- DrewAdams

Buffer-Menu+ v21.0 does not work with Emacs 24.1.50.1 (full version information: ##GNU Emacs 24.1.50.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.4.1) of 2012-05-25 on rhenium, modified by Debian##). When I invoke `buffer-menu' I get the following error message: ##list-buffers-noselect: Symbol's value as variable is void: Buffer-menu-sort-button-map## -- MoritzBunkus


[new:DrewAdams:2012-06-07 13:31 UTC]
Yes, sorry about that.  ChongYidong rewrote the code in vanilla ##buff-menu.el## so that it uses his new so-called "tabulated list mode".  (And they apparently have not documented the change in `view-emacs-news' -- I filed a bug report about that.)

Dunno when (or whether) I will update <tt>[[buff-menu+.el]]</tt> to deal with that -- no doubt not for a while anyway.  Fortunately, 24.1 will not be affected -- the change is only for 24.2+.  

If you want a workaround for now, grab the ##buff-menu.el## code from the latest Emacs 24 pretest or prior (e.g. from Emacs 23), and load that, then ##buff-menu+.el##.  -- DrewAdams

[new]
I've taken ##buff-menu.el## from Emacs 23, and that works. Thanks for the hint. I can happily use this combination, so fix ##buff-menu+## whenever it suits you best. -- MoritzBunkus
