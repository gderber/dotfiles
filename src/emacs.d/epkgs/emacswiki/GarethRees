Oops...  Sorry for the reverting half of the correct part of the change, too... goes to show how bad my special uh spelling is.  ;) -- AlexSchroeder

I don't understand how I managed to make the "line" and "mark" changes you reverted.  I have no recollection of doing anything other than "special" -> "symbolic".  A bug in wiki? -- GarethRees

Hm.  I'll watch out for this kind of error, but I never heard of it before.
Perhaps you looked at an older revision when you decided to edit the page?
Anyway, nice write-up on DynamicBindingVsLexicalBinding!
