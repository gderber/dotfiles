There are two modes for editing Turtle/N3 (semantic web) formats:
* https://github.com/kurtjx/n3-mode-for-emacsâ€Ž
* https://bitbucket.org/nxg/ttl-mode

Both are fairly poor.

I'm looking for features like this Eclipse-based editor:
https://github.com/AKSW/Xturtle/wiki/Editor-Features
and editing SPARQL.

Any takers or feedback?
