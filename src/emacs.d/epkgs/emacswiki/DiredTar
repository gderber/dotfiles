Dired-tar adds a command for creating and unpacking
tar files in DiredMode.  When using this package, typing `T' on a tar file in a
dired listing unpacks the tar file, decompressing it if necessary.
Typing `T' on a directory packs up that directory into a gzipped
tar file named DIRNAME.tar.gz.

The package is quite old. Does anybody knows a newer version of dired-tar?

Although old (1996) it still works well in Emacs from Bzr (now in 2011). But I think something like this should be included in GNU Emacs. -- DanielClemente
