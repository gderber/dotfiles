If you want immediate feedback on your spelling, you may try FlySpell.
If you know your most common mistakes already, however, AutoCorrection
is better.

Assume your three most common errors are these: "teh" instead of
"the", "yors" instead of "yours" and "cputer" instead of "computer".
You can define abbreviations for these.  An abbreviation is a word
which Emacs will translate into another word, as soons as you type a
non-word character.  If you type t e h SPC, for example, Emacs will
translate this into "the " -- which is exactly what you want.

See this Lisp:autocorrection_abbrev_defs for some more common auto correction abbrevs.

Read about AbbrevMode in the EmacsManual.
