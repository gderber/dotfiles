WanderLust has some problems with Emacs 23:

* UTF-8 text is misencoded

Use the CVS version to avoid this problem.

I was able to get UTF-8 working on Emacs 23 with WL 2.15.9 by adding the follwing

    (setq-default mime-transfer-level 8)

Taken from [http://lists.airs.net/wl-en/archive/201001/msg00054.html this] thread.
