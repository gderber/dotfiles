After the success of [[Emacs_Conference_2013]] some people at the conference and not at the conference collected on the //#emacs// channel to discuss running a Swarm.

//Swarm// is a term invented by [[PhilHagelberg]] which refers to collecting together some hackers in a screen or tmux or using some other screen or editor sharing tool to hack collaboratively on some code. A swarm can take place in virtual space and is therefore ideal for very distributed //#emacs// people.

NicFerrier has written a [[https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-swarmhacker|swarm hacker mode]] to allow A Swarm using an Emacs buffer as a chat sink. There can be as many users as there are colors. That's probably an effective limit of 5 or 6.

== When? ==

An experiment will happen sometime in the week ending 6th/7th April 2013.

If it works then we may do it regularly.

== The plan ==

* fire up a server somewhere, NicFerrier has one we can use for now
** PhilHagelberg suggests using [[https://syme.herokuapp.com|Syme]]
* install Emacs 24 on it
* start emacs 24 as a daemon

{{{
emacs --daemon=someserver
}}}

* create emacsclients with their own frames

{{{
emacsclient -c -s /tmp/emacsXXXX/someserver somefile
}}}

* install the swarmhacker package
* ##M-x swarmhacker## to give everyone a name in the single //chat// buffer
* hack on something together using a lot of indirect buffers

== Coping with different dev styles ==

Say you want to use paredit and I don't, we can still co-operate in, the same Emacs instance, by using indirect buffers:

{{{
C-x b the-file-being-hacked [RET]
M-x clone-indirect-buffer [RET]
}}}

now you can turn on whatever editing eccentricity you like //for the current buffer// and it won't affect anyone else.

This is pretty much how the //swarmhacker// code, above, works.
