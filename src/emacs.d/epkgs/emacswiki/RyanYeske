I use Emacs every day of my life.

I am a co-author of NethackMode.

More recently (late 2004) I wrote [[rcirc]], a small (but getting bigger) irc client.

I want everyone to just get along.

: Hello and welcome!  Nethack mode seems very very cool.  I didn't try
it yet because I did not want to patch Nethack myself.  I'm still
waiting for the patched Nethack to appear in Debian testing... --
