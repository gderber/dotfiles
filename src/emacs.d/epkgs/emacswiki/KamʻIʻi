I use GNU Emacs. I also use VI and GEdit.  My aspiration is to reach a point where I feel comfortable enough to be able to liberate myself from the 2 inferior products (i.e., VI & GEdit).

=About me=
I've been using GNU Emacs (and, previously, XEmacs) sporadically for years.  I've essentially used it as an editor while ignoring its huge collection of features.

Recently, I have taken up learning CL and, consequently, improving my understanding of the Emacs system.

=About my name=
I was born Christopher (no middle name) !McIntosh. While living in Hawaiʻi for most of my formative years, I was given a Hawaiian name by a Kupuna (elder of the community).  That name is Kameahāʻaweokaponia ʻIʻi.  I decided that I needed to have a middle name *and* I wanted to remain connected to my genealogical roots.  So I took my birth surname and adopted it as a middle name.

Aloha, Drew; and, mahalo ā nui loa (thank you very much).  I am excited to have found EmacsWiki and am pleased with the quality that I've found thus far. -- KamʻIʻi
