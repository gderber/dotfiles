=== GPL Version 3 ===

RichardStallman and the [[FSF]] have launced a Web and email service for involving people in the process of authoring version 3 of the [[GPL]].

The GPL has and continues to take a creative and effective role in supporting great works of free software--including Emacs--and in fostering a vibrant community of hackers, users and their evangelists (See ChurchOfEmacs).  This occured in simultaneity with the explosion of proprietary software and its commercial and legal strategies that hide source code and instead restrict computer users.

How can the GPL continue in a new era and in an international arena of new technologies providing new social implications?  Find out by joining the fight for the future of free software, or just sign up for the mailing list.

Currently, the documents consist only of the [http://www.fsf.org/news/gplv3 press release from September] and a 22-page "process definition" document.  The latter document is brief and readable for anyone familiar with [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/ software licensing] or [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ free software philosophy and legal matters].
