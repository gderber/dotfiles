Hello!!

This is [::avallark] at the #emacs channel. I use emacs as my regular editor, irc client and sqlplus editor using sql-oracle.

Thanks fellas for all the help at the emacs channel.

    Welcome on the wiki !

Thanks Lukhas,

I though it might be helpful for newbies if I put up my .emacs here : AvallarkDotEmacs Its just got very basic stuff like hiding the menu, scroll bar and stuff like that.

For a while, I have been using emacs on Mac. Is great, but i initially struggled to get some keys mapped right: Here is my dot emacs for mac : AvallarkDotEmacsForMac

color-theme and bar-cursor can be obtained by using apt-get install emacs-goodies :)

The erc package can be obtained [http://sourceforge.net/projects/erc/ here] and more documentation can be obtained at EmacsIRCClient

Just got my gnus working on the emacs, and i am able to read and send mails. the only problem seems to be is that sending mail is really slow for me. maybe becaue i am using gnus to directly talk to my smtp server. aadis suggested i should get gnus to talk to my local machine server and then that should talk to the server. will implement that tonight.

Thanks guys. 

Just started using python. So started using the python mode in emacs. 
You can get the python mode [http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-mode/ from here]. 
Also you need to add the some lines in your dotEmacs.

I am forced to use windows at my office and hence the dot emacs that i use for a window machine is available here : AvallarkDotEmacsForWindows

Using Mac OSX on international Keyboard layout is an immense task to get things working. Here is a working .emacs config to get most of the things working. AvallarkDotEmacsForMac
