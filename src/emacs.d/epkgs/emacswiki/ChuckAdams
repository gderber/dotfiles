Just another Emacs hacker.
My current platform is XEmacs on Windows 2000.  Win2k with a full suite of cygwin tools is my general platform of choice.  I started with Emacs (don't remember which version) in 1991 on PRIMOS, and just got wired to it instantly -- it helped that it was the only fully non-modal editor on the machine with any power.

Another obscure programming environment I like is MOO.

EmaXML -- intends to be a collection of various XML modes

=== Misc Info ===
UseMod:CliffordAdams is my brother, who is about 100 times the hacker I ever will be.

Hello and welcome!  This reminds me that I should mail your brother
one of these days...  -- AlexSchroeder
