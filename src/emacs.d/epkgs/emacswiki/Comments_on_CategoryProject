Significant overlap with CategoryProgrammerUtils? Maybe move some items from there to here?

Yes, CategoryProgrammerUtils already has a long section, but (again) I was more comfortable creating new content than disturbing someone else's work.

Yeah, but on the other hand we get a lot of criticism that the wiki needs better organization, so this is my gentle prodding in the right direction. ;)

Forget that noise -- if it isn't a "work-in-progress" then it isn't a Wiki.

I'll take a crack at this one after I get your assessment on the changes made to CategoryCode/CategoryExtensions.

(FWIW, I would be more in favor of a CategoryProject than a CategoryExtensions. It is more well defined etc.)

But my suggestion --- for all of this stuff that you are doing, is to do the following ''instead'':

* ''Propose'' a change (this is reorg of the wiki, after all, not just tweaking or adding some ordinary page) for ''discussion''.

* Try first reorganizing ''within'' existing categories.  Try adding a subheading on an existing category page, which introduces a list of links having to do with projects (or whatever).  We can thus ''organize'' that way, before any discussion or attempt to '''''RE'''''organize.

* After discussion and consensus, we can move toward whatever is decided.

If attempts to organize within the existing category structure present significant obstacles and indicate that a real '''''RE'''organization would be in order, '''''then''''' we can discuss what that reorg should be.  '''''Then''''', after agreement, we can move to implement the reorg.

This is true. At the same time, I hesitate to just kill the energy of somebody that is effectively volunteering to organize a segment of the wiki.

I am also reminded of old discussions on Meatball Wiki, MeatBall:ForestFire (about newcomers making massive changes) and MeatBall:ColdBlanket (about conservative and cautious people killing enthusiasm).

I agree.  I don't want to kill the enthusiasm.  But I'd sooner it be redirected to interaction (discussion first) and to action on ordinary pages --- as a way to start.  Basic restructuring is perhaps a place where a little more conservatism is in order.

That's why we generally make it more difficult to change the meta level (e.g. the structure/rules of the game).  It takes a lot more to amend the US Constitution than it does to pass a new law, for example.
