Hello, this is my Emacs Wiki web.
I've been using Emacs for several years.

: Hello and welcome!  You're web page reminded me that I still need to learn Japanese.  ^_^ -- AlexSchroeder
: I provided a english document for recently released package CalculationPad. It may contain a lot of mistakes in English,though. -- AkimichiTatsukawa
