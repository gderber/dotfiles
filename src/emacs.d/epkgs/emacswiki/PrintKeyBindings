[http://www.jonganc.net/emacs.html PKB (Print Key-Bindings)] is a package for printing keybindings in a pretty fashion, i.e. so that bindings are listed as in a computer keyboard and grouped by base-keys. Currently the output is in html format.

As an example, here is the output for the global map of a default emacs installation:  [http://www.jonganc.net/emacs/example.html example.html].

The macro itself is two files:
Lisp:pkb-0.2.el
Lisp:pkb-html-0.2.el

== Some notes on the current version ==

* Customizing: The functions are designed so that the output can be extensively customized to adapt to the end-user's desires. Look at the help function for `pkb-html-save-keymap' for more info.
* The current default settings are aimed at me and my keyboard. Again, by customizing the various default variables (e.g. `pkb-include-base-key-list', `pkb-html-event-replace-bk', `pkb-key-groups', etc.) it should be fairly straightforward to adapt the code for different keyboards. (In fact, it would probably be possible to set these settings by detecting some system variables.)
* The formatting of the output is not terribly pretty. This should be very easy to change; I haven't spent too much time on that since it otherwise does what I want. Also, if you are using an older browser that doesn't support CSS 3 (e.g. IE 6 or 7), the output will be particularly unattractive.
