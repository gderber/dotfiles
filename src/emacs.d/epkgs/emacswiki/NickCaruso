Hey.  I have an iBook, I run the Carbonized version of  Emacs 21.1, currently via the fink package, soon to be built from the CVS sources provided by AndrewChoi et alia. 

I am interested in many things.  I have little time to work on them, as I'm a stay-at-home dad to a 2 yr old, but you can read about some of them at http://polarangel.org.

Or perhaps you'd prefer my blog: http://polarangel.org/lctb/
