When writing EmacsLisp code, whether it is for your <tt>~/.emacs</tt> or for a separate package, it is generally important to try and make sure it will work on Emacs, XEmacs, and older versions of those as well.

Here are some recommendations to avoid common pitfalls:

* Avoid testing specific versions:  Use things like <tt>fboundp</tt>, <tt>boundp</tt>, <tt>featurep</tt>. In other cases, you can also just try to run the code, and catch a potential error with <tt>condition-case</tt>.  If you need to distinguish between Emacs and XEmacs and none of the above helped, use <tt>(featurep 'xemacs)</tt>.
* Use EasyMenu to make menus.
* Use EmacsOverlays rather than XEmacsExtents:  The XEmacs emulation of overlays which you can get with <tt>(require 'overlay)</tt> is much better than any Emacs emulation of extents you could ever write.
* Use imenu rather than func-menu.
