These are no longer the days of the VT100 -- when emacs had to rely on
what the VT could send.

This page is dedicated to getting everything out of emacs keys on the
console and in a terminal emulator such as xterm.

I first implemented this on the linux console, where the Fn keys are
represented by a string or sequence of weird characters, which emacs
will then translate into the appropriate FunctionKeys.

My keyboard has two <> buttons (that is a diamond) that I wanted to
use as meta keys, so I configured them to act as the meta modifier
instead of alt, like I had previously done in X.

Then I wanted M-Fn to work as well, since I was using (now) A-Fn to
switch VTs.

The solution is quite simple, make M-Fn produce another weird sequence
and make emacs translate them into M-Fn.

== Configuring Your Console or Terminal to Send Weird Characters ==

Some of these are obviously not written yet ;)

* LinuxConsoleKeys -- configuring the Linux Console
* FreeBSDConsoleKeys
* SolarisConsoleKeys -- this should possibly be called Screen,
change the title before writing the page, if so.

* XTermKeys -- configuring the all powerful xterm
* RxvtKeys
* KonsoleKeys -- the KDE terminal emulator
* ETermKeys -- the Enlightenment terminal
* GnomeTerminalKeys -- The gnome-terminal terminal emulator

Please add whatever terminal info you can ;-)


== Making Emacs Change the Sequence Into Keys ===

To make emacs translate your sequence into keys, you add it to
function-key-map with define-key, like so:

    (define-key function-key-map "^[[^[[[A" (kbd "M-<f1>"))

This is the string I chose to represent M-f1, The ^[ is really the ESC
key, you can insert it into a buffer with C-q ESC.  It is a good idea
not to choose strings that conflict with string the terminal already
sends.  For me, "^[[[A" is F1, so I choose to prefix it with ESC but
didn't feel comfortable with two ESC, since one does sometimes want to
enter them by the numbers into emacs, so I put a "[" between them.


''[Why not use <tt>\e</tt> instead of the literal escape char?  That would avoid possible problems when transmitting the file over the network.]

''[Note: Emacs documentation for "Translation Keymaps" suggests <tt>local-function-key-map</tt> over <tt>function-key-map</tt>]


I can only give the following advice when choosing strings:

* Avoid conflicts with existing strings, eg. do not just append
to a string to make it different.
* Do not create anything you're likely to actually type, since emacs
does not see a difference between what you type and what keys insert
as strings.

I would also like to point out that using [(meta f1)] did not work
exactly in emacs 21.3, but (kdb "M-<f1>") did.  It returns [M-F1].
There seems to be a slight incompatibility in between them.
