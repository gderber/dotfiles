KillingAndYanking a line backwards can be done with `M-0 C-k' or `C-u 0 C-k'.

Deleting words backwards with `C-DEL' or `M-DEL' (`backward-kill-word') is useful since each kill appends to the kill ring and is available as a single yank.  If the point is anywhere in the first sentence, `C-x DEL' (`backward-kill-sentence') can also delete to the beginning of the line.

Note, `C-M-backspace' is bound to restarting X Window or rebooting the system with the Linux kernel, so beware.

If you needed a command specifically for killing backwards, use the following code by EvaluatingExpressions or by adding it to your InitFile:

{{{
(defun backward-kill-line (arg)
  "Kill ARG lines backward."
  (interactive "p")
  (kill-line (- 1 arg)))
}}}

You may want to bind it to a different key

{{{
(global-set-key "\C-cu" 'backward-kill-line) ;; `C-c u'
}}}

To join a line with the previous use `##M-^##' (`delete-indentation').  It deletes the newline character on the previous line.  To delete the newline at the end of the current line use `##C-u M-^##'.
