Or You can download all file here: http://learn.tsinghua.edu.cn:8080/2005211356/src/bibus.zip

= Installation =
* Make sure you have install mysql in your mashine, and you have
 privilege to access and change database.
* reate database from command line:
<pre>
 $ mysql -u user -p -e "CREATE DATABASE biblio"
</pre>
* Create tables using give file mysql.sql:
<pre>
 $ mysql -u user -p biblio < mysql.sql
</pre>

  If you want have a try, you can import example data as well.
<pre>
 $ mysql -u user -p biblio < biblio.sql
</pre>

* install package for emacs. Add this lines to .emacs:
<pre>
 (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/bibus")
 (require 'bibus)
</pre>

That's all! Let's begin.

= Start up =
bibus invoke by <code>M-x bibus</code>.
When it start up, three windows will show in current frame. Typically
it will like as following:
<pre>
         +-----+----------+
         | key |  ref     |
         |     |          |
         |     |          |
         |     |          |
         |     |          |
         |     +----------+
         |     |  entry   |
         +-----+----------+
</pre>

When you in other buffer, you can back to the bibus by use
<code>M-x bibus</code>, too.

= In KEY buffer =
In "key" buffer, there is a tree widget like this:
<pre>
[-] Bibus
 |-[-] References
 |  |-  RNA2ndStruct
 |  |-  Database
 |  `-  Junk
 |-  Tagged
 |-  All
 |-[+] Query
 |-  Online
 |-  Import
 `-  Cited
</pre>

The first node "References" contain several keys. In bibus, a
reference can associate with one or more keys. When put button of the
keys, the references associate with this key will be displayed in ref
buffer. So when you move the TextCursor to the word "RNA2ndStruct", and press
key RET, the reference related with RNA second struct will be
displayed. You can use TAB to navigate from one widget to other.
You can use key "a" and "d" to add a new key or delete key at current
line. 

The "Tagged" is a special key, which you can't temporarily tagged some
references. The "All" key contain all references in the database. You
can't delete this keys.

The subtree "Query" contain some query items. When press RET when
cursor on the icon before Query, the items will be show. You can use
key "s" to view the query sql. Edit the sql with key "e", and
delete with key "d". To add new query, use key "A". For a temporary
query, you can use C-c C-s which also work in ref or entry buffer.
If you want save the temporary query, use key "R" to name the query.

To move to REF buffer, use key sequence C-c C-r, C-c C-e to move
to ENTRY buffer, and C-c C-k to move back to KEY buffer. This command
is common to REF and ENTRY buffer.

= In REF buffer =
When you select a key to display, a table like this will display REF buffer:
<pre>
 Identifier      Author               Year  Title

You can use TAB and BACKTAB to move between columns. You can widen the
current column by key ">" and "<" to narrow it. This is only take
effect in this section. If you want to save it, you should modify the
variable `bibus-formats' and save it in you .emacs. The table can be
sort use key "S". "C-u S" mean sort the table by ascent.

If you want to see the full content of current field, you can press
key "s". And "w" can add the content to kill ring, which you can paste
to other place.

To tag the reference to other key, use key "t". You can tag several
reference by marked it first. Mark a reference by use key "m". After
mark the reference, you can do some command with the marked reference,
such as associate with other key, add to "Tagged" key, delete them from
current key, and delete them from database. Note that, when you delete
the reference from current key when press key "d", the reference is
not delete from database. You can delete the reference from database
in "All" key using key "D". When you has some references marked, and
you want add a new key name to current reference, you can use key
"C-t" to set key for reference of current line. C-c C-o to open the
"URL" of the reference, and C-c C-f to open the file. The reference
table bibref doesn't contain a field "File", so you have to save the
file name to a custom field, such as "Custom5". To change the file
name, press key "R".

= In ENTRY buffer =
ENTRY buffer is to show the detail information for the reference. When
you move to difference line in REF buffer, the ENTRY will change
accord to the line of you cursor. This may take sometime to update,
because it is done by a timer which repeat after a delay of certain
seconds. The content to show in ENTRY buffer can be customize by
modify the variable `bibus-entry-list-fields' which may require to
familar with elisp.

When press key "E" in ENTRY buffer, a form will display, you can set
the field, and submit by press button in the last line or press key
"C-c C-c" outside the text field(I don't know how to modify keymap in
the text field). Quit without change can use key C-u C-c C-c. Reset
all field by use key "E".

= More about customize =

== Change the buffer name of ref, key, entry ==
Set bibus-buffer-names in the form of its definition.

== Change the window config ==
Set bibus-window-configuration as the docstring,
And Type M-x bibus-erase-window-config, then M-x bibus.

To explain how to work out a setting of bibus-window-configuration,
take the setting <code>(key (vertical 0.8 (entry)) (horizontal 0.35 (ref)))</code>
as an example.

Let us start at one window, the CAR part of bibus-window-configuration
is key, that told set the window associate with the buffer key. the
second slot of bibus-window-configuration is <code>(vertical 0.8 (entry))</code>.
It tell emacs to split current window vertically with portion 0.8. The
third slot is <code>(entry)</code>, this is mean set the other window, the below
one, as with config <code>(entry)</code>, which just set the window associate with entry
buffer.

Then we get the windows like this, and current selected window still
in key, the above one:
<pre>
      +--------------------+
      | key                |
      |                    |
      |                    |
      |                    |
      |                    |
      |                    |
      +--------------------+
      | entry              |
      |                    |        
      +--------------------+        
</pre>

The third slot is <code>(horizontal 0.35 (ref))</code>. It tell emacs
to split current window horizontally with poition 0.35 and set the
other window with config <code>(ref)</code>.

At last we get windows like this:
<pre>
      +-----+--------------+
      | key | ref          |
      |     |              |
      |     |              |
      |     |              |
      |     |              |
      |     |              |
      +-----+--------------+
      | entry              |
      |                    |        
      +--------------------+        
</pre>

The setting is done recursively. Before set up a configuration, draw it
out and split the window step by step, you can easily make it.

== key binding ==
There is a common map bibus-common-map. Modify this map will take
effect in the three buffer. But certain command only can be preformed
in one buffer, be careful.

== elide string ==
You can set your elide string in ref buffer, such as "...". But I
don't think it is a good idea.

== reference table formats ==
You can set the table fields to display in ref buffer. Take the
default as example:

<pre>
(setq bibus-formats
  '(("Author" 20) " " ("Year" 5) " " ("Journal" 10) " " ("Title" 40)))
</pre>

If the element is a string, this will insert to every line.
If it is a list, the CAR part is field name, the CDR part is widen of
the column. After change the format, you should compile it by
<code>M-x bibus-compile-format</code>.
