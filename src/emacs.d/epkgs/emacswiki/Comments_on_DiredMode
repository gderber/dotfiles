I think turn-on-gnus-dired-mode should be placed here. See http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/14514/how-to-attach-multiple-files-in-message-mode

Placed where? You are free to edit page DiredMode, if you think something should be added there.

If it is about Gnus then please also link to the most appropriate wiki page(s) for Gnus.

Thanks Drew!  After reading your comment I think information about turn-on-gnus-dired-mode fits better to the gnus side than to the dired side.

I put an entry to https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusNiftyTricks.
