Sweat is a simple template system. But it's not designed to be useful anywhere outside of EmacsLISP.

Sweat is now unmaintained by NicFerrier.

It would be best to offer an example:

{{{
(sweat-let ((title "nic's demo"))
       "<html><head><title>::title::</title><head><body>"
       "</body></html>"
    )
}}}

The result of this is a string which is the evaluation of the template:

{{{
<html><head><title>nic's demo</title><head><body></body></html>
}}}

sweat-let is a little like ordinary let:

* define a list of bindings for values that will be used in the template 
* list the forms of the template
* evaluation means to replace the ::variable:: names in the templates with the values from the bindings

Here's a more complex example:

{{{
(sweat-let ((title "nic's demo")
            (items (stream-from-list
                    (lambda (item)
                      `((name . ,(car item))
                        (value . ,(cdr item))))
                    '(("username" . "nicferrier")
                      ("firstname" . "nic")))))
       "<html><head><title>::title::</title><head><body><ul>"
       (sweat-* items "<li>::name:: - ::value::</li>")
       "</ul></body></html>"
    )
}}}

This shows that you can have more complex things happening in the form list. In this case '''items''' is a stream. A stream is a function that produces items from a list it is bound to. '''sweat-*''' iterates over the stream processing the template against each item from the stream. In this case the items are binding lists.
