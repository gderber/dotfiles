I'm thinking of no longer generating the tarballs.

# No more elisp.tar.gz -- you can get the elisp files from the [[CVS repository]].
# No more emacs.tar.gz -- you can get the entire system from the [[Rsync repository]].
# No more static.tar.gz -- ok, I confess, I don't have a good reason for discontinuing the HTML tarball. If there's demand for this, I think we should create a new version control repository somewhere and check the HTML files in.
# Bonus episode: You can get the raw text of all the pages from the [[SVN repository]].

What do you think?

I like the idea.  Seems simpler. I'm sure you thought of this, but why not simply have everything in one repository?

# "historical reasons" -- hahaha :)
# "avoiding single points of failure" -- except that two of the three repositories are run by [[zeus]] 8-)
# Unfortunately that leads to the last possibility: "no planning"

Instead of getting it right straight from the start I was more interested in seeing what worked, and once I confirmed that, other things started falling into place.

Now that I think of it, "avoiding single points of failure" sounds like a good idea. -- Alex
