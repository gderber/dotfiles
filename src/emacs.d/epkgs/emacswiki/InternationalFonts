== Questions ==

Why (on "GNU Emacs 21.3.50.1 (i386-mingw-nt5.0.2195)") do some TrueType fonts (such as http://www.orindalodge.org/kadoshsamaritan.php) not show up in the <S-mouse-1> list?


: Do I need to do something with FontSets first?  I don't understand that yet...


== Install ==
You may need to install additional fonts to display some
international characters.  Here are some sources for these fonts.

=== GNU Intlfonts ===

This package is best integrated with Emacs.  Emacs has two FontSets by default;
the intlfonts package has fonts for the `standard' one.  However, the latest free
X distributions (XFree86 and X.org) now have more comprehensive sets.

* ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/intlfonts/

You can also install these as packages from your favorite
distribution.  In Debian, for example, the fonts have been split into
smaller packages.  This is what it looks like in dselect, for example:

  -- Opt x11      xfonts-intl- <none>      1.1-9       International fonts for X -- Asian.
  -- Opt x11      xfonts-intl- <none>      1.1-9       International fonts for X -- Chinese.
  -- Opt x11      xfonts-intl- <none>      1.1-9       International fonts for X -- Chinese big.
  -- Opt x11      xfonts-intl- <none>      1.1-9       International fonts for X -- European.  
 *** Opt x11      xfonts-intl- 1.1-9       1.1-9       International fonts for X -- Japanese.
 *** Opt x11      xfonts-intl- 1.1-9       1.1-9       International fonts for X -- Japanese big.
  -- Opt x11      xfonts-intl- <none>      1.1-9       International fonts for X -- Phonetic Alphabet.

=== Unicode ===

If you want to use the UnicodeEncoding, you will need appropriate
fonts, too.  The fonts must be for the ISO 10646-1 encoding.  You can
get the one from Markus Kuhn's page.  This page is a good introduction
to the problems, too.

* http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs-fonts.html

Note that many Unicode fonts are incomplete, so the language you are
interested in may not yet be in the font.  Check before you download.

In fact, you don't necessarily need a 10646-encoded font to display unicoded text.
Firstly, the text doesn't have to be decoded into the mule-unicode charsets (e.g.
the typical configuration of Mule-UCS).
Second, you can map a character repertoire on to a font with a more-or-less arbitrary
encoding which supports that repertoire---see `font-ccl-encoder-alist'.
Here's an example setup to use Latin-1 fonts
for characters from other Emacs charsets which are unified with Latin-1:

    (define-ccl-program encode-iso8859-1-font
      `(0
        (translate-character ucs-8859-1-encode-table r0 r1)
        (if (r0 === ,(charset-id 'latin-iso8859-1))
    	(r1 = (r1 + 160)))))
    (map-char-table (lambda (k v)
    		  (if v (set-fontset-font t k '(nil . "iso8859-1"))))
    		ucs-8859-1-encode-table)
    (add-to-list 'font-ccl-encoder-alist '("iso8859-1" . encode-iso8859-1-font))

Also, complex scripts encoded as utf-8 may require specialized fonts for the relevant
glyphs such that you can't display them with an iso10646-1 font.
See the Indian support added after Emacs 21.3, for instance---the glyphs
required to display the combining characters generally don't correspond to
Unicode characters.

=== GNU Unifont ===

Another attempt at creating a Unicode font.  (This URL is probably obsolete.  You can
get an up-to-date version of unifont from Debian archives.)
