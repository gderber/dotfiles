This page lists privacy issues concerning this site.

==  Cookies ==

The wiki uses a cookie that doesn't identify individual users. The
cookie is used to remember your preferences from one visit to the
next. If you examine the cookie, you need to split it along the
URL-encoded 0x1e byte (%251e). A typical user's cookie might contain
##username AlexSchroeder##, for example. This says which username
you'd like to use when editing a page.

== Username ==

Nothing requires usernames to be unique. You can pick any valid page
name. If you do provide a username, we're going to store it in various
places:

# our log files for [[Recent Changes]]

# any page you edit for the little note at the bottom saying who last
  edited it

# the "keep" pages which are used for the page history (follow the
  *View other revisions* link at the bottom of a regular page)

Information on this site is available via the HTML pages, RSS, and Gopher.

== Backups ==

Offline backups of the data exist on the private laptop of Alex
Schroeder and his backup disks. The data is encrypted and access is
limited to Alex Schroeder and his wife. The data will be overwritten
at irregular intervals.

==  Tracking of Reader IP Numbers ==
  
In order to prevent leeching, the wiki also keeps of the IP numbers
that have visited the site in the last twenty seconds. The `visitors.log`
file lists IP numbers and timestamps as follows:

{{{text
127.0.0.1 1390729057 1390728798 1390728798 1390728798 1390728797 1390670644 1390670381 1390670381 1390670380 1390670380
}}}

This is updated whenever somebody visits the site. This information is
not public.

==  Tracking of Author IP Numbers ==

The wiki also tracks IP numbers whenever a page is edited. The idea is
that we want to ban certain people from editing the site via
[[BannedHosts|Banned Hosts]].

After four days the IP number will be removed from our wiki log files by the maintenance job.

*Recent changes* records IP number of authors. If you check
[Self:action=rc Recent Changes], you'll see that we're translating IP
numbers of anonymous edits into a colour code. Weâ€™re using a hash
function to turn the IP number into an 32bit number, convert it to
octal, take the first four digits and show one of eight colours for
each one.

==  Web Server Logs ==

The web server itself also keeps access log and error logs. These go
back four days. They contain IP numbers and the URLs they requested.
These log files are not public. These are used to help find
configuration errors, missing redirects and the like.

== Spammers ==

As you can see on WikiSpam, we log all the blocked edits that ran
afoul of our banning rules. These log files contain IP numbers. These
logs also go back four days.
