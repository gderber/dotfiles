If you have decided to build XEmacs ([[XEmacs]] on this wiki) from
source, you must be aware of the XEmacsPackageSystem.  The easiest is
to get *all* packages at once, the so called sumo-tarball.

Here are the instructions to build XEmacs without MULE on a GNU/Linux
system.

== Getting It ==

In your XEmacs mirror site, download the following files:

From either the stable or the gamma (nearly stable) directories, get
an XEmacs tarball.  It is called xemacs-<version>.tar.gz,
eg. xemacs-21.4.6.tar.gz.

From the packages directory, get xemacs-sumo.tar.gz.  This will
automatically be the latest released tarball with all packages
included.

Unpack both as root, for example in /usr/local/src.  This will give
you two directories, xemacs-<version> and xemacs-packages.

: Once you have XEmacs installed you may also install and use the [http://www.xemacs.org/Documentation/packages/html/build.html#SEC_Top build] package to learn how to build XEmacs.  It also supports [http://www.xemacs.org/Documentation/packages/html/build_4.html#SEC6 build settings], which makes it easy to build many different configurations after setting them up once -- AdrianAichner via [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/SimpleWikiEditMode SimpleWikiEditMode]

== Building XEmacs ==

I will assume you will want to use stow to install into /usr/local.
That is why we build using the /usr/local prefix, but install using
the /usr/local/stow/xemacs prefix.  Stow will then link all the files
into /usr/local.  If you don't want to use stow, do not provide a
prefix to the make install command and skip the remaining instructions.

Enter the xemacs-<version> directory, and then run:

<pre>
 ./configure
 make
 make install prefix=/usr/local/stow/xemacs

 cd /usr/local/stow/xemacs
</pre>

Now you will need to resolve some conflicts if you have GnuEmacs,
GnuClient installed as well as XEmacs.  In my case, I decided to leave
the Emacs version of all files, so I delete the XEmacs version here,
before stowing in /usr/local.

<pre>
 rm /usr/local/stow/xemacs/man/man1/etags.1
 rm /usr/local/stow/xemacs/man/man1/ctags.1
 rm /usr/local/stow/xemacs/bin/etags
 rm /usr/local/stow/xemacs/bin/ctags
 rm /usr/local/stow/xemacs/man/man1/gnuserv.1
 rm /usr/local/stow/xemacs/bin/gnuclient
 rm /usr/local/stow/xemacs/bin/gnudoit
 rm /usr/local/stow/xemacs/bin/b2m
 rm /usr/local/stow/xemacs/bin/rcs-checkin
</pre>

And finally:

<pre>
 stow xemacs
</pre>

== Building Packages ==

Go to the parent directory of xemacs-packages.  In my example, that
would be /usr/local/src.  You want the xemacs-packages to reside in 
/usr/local/lib/xemacs.

Without stow, you can just do the right thing:

<pre>
 mv xemacs-packages /usr/local/lib/xemacs
</pre>

With stow, things get a bit more complicated:

<pre>
 mkdir -p /usr/local/stow/xemacs-packages/lib/xemacs
 mv xemacs-packages /usr/local/stow/xemacs-packages/lib/xemacs
 cd /usr/local/stow
 stow xemacs-packages
</pre>
