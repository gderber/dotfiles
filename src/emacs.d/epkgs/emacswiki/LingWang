Hi, all emacers.
I use Emacs.
Currently, I have two contributions here: VisibleLines, and Lisp:pycomplete+.el.

Hi, we had the intention to include [[pycomplete+.el]] with python-mode in Gentoo, but were wondering about its licence. The original pycomplete.el was written by Skip Montanaro and carries his copyright notice [http://python-mode.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/python-mode/trunk/python-mode/pycomplete.el?revision=464&view=markup]. pycomplete+.el is clearly based on that code, but has a GPL notice and the original author info was removed, which doesn't look right to me. Care to shed some light on the issue? -- [[ulm]]
