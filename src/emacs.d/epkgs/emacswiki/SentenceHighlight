Here's a simple hack for highlighting the current sentence in the text. When writing and especially copyediting, being able to see at once where the current sentence starts and ends -- especially in a complex text with long periods and wall-of-text paragraphs -- saves a few milliseconds each time, and these milliseconds add up. 

This isn't a real mode; just yank the code below to your .emacs. You need to choose in which major mode it will be active; below it is enabled for Outline mode, which I prefer for writing and editing. If you use XEmacs instead of Emacs, make a few compatibility changes as indicated in the comments below.

{{{
(setq sentence-end "[^.].[.?!]+\\([]\"')}]*\\|<[^>]+>\\)\\($\\| $\\|\t\\| \\)[ \t\n]*")

(setq sentence-color "#d5cfd9") ; foreground  color  for the current sentence; adjust as needed
(setq sentence-face (make-face 'sentence-face-background))
(set-face-foreground sentence-face sentence-color)

(defun sentence-begin-pos () (save-excursion (unless (= (point) (point-max)) (forward-char)) (backward-sentence) (point)))
(defun sentence-end-pos () (save-excursion (unless (= (point) (point-max)) (forward-char)) (backward-sentence) (forward-sentence) (point)))

(setq sentence-highlight-mode nil)

(defun sentence-highlight-current (&rest ignore)
  "Highlight current sentence."    
    (and sentence-highlight-mode (> (buffer-size) 0)
    (progn
      (and  (boundp 'sentence-extent)
        sentence-extent
        (move-overlay sentence-extent (sentence-begin-pos) (sentence-end-pos) (current-buffer)) ;;; XEmacs: use set-extent-endpoints instead of move-overlay
      )
)))

(setq sentence-extent (make-overlay 0 0)) ;;; XEmacs: use make-extent instead of make-overlay
(overlay-put sentence-extent 'face sentence-face) ; ;;; XEmacs: use set-extent-property instead of overlay-put

;;;;; Now, enable this for Outline mode only:

(add-hook 'outline-mode-hook (function (lambda () 

 ; .... any other outline mode tweaks or key definitions you may need

 (make-local-variable 'sentence-highlight-mode)
 (setq sentence-highlight-mode t)
 (add-hook 'post-command-hook	'sentence-highlight-current)
)))
}}}

I have turned this into a minor mode (and cleaned it up somewhat):

Lisp:sentence-highlight.el

(Also available as an [ELPA] package: http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/sentence-highlight/)

See [[Sentences]] for information on how Emacs recognizes them.
