== malabar-mode :: A better Java mode for Emacs ==

You may want to skip to Installation

=== Why yet another Java mode? ===

After all there is java-mode, included with recent Emacsen, and
[http://jdee.sourceforge.net/ JDEE] if you want something more IDEish.  So why yet another?

==== java-mode ====

There's nothing (much) wrong with java-mode, but it doesn't provide
enough power to do the things a Java developer (I, at least) needs to
do every day.

==== JDEE ====

Enter JDEE.  It's big, it's powerful, it probably includes more
features than you'll ever need; I mean, who needs to [http://jdee.sourceforge.net/jdedoc/html/jde-ug/jde-ug-content.html#d0e4142 run jdb on an
applet] these days?

Yet even so, something is lacking.  It's something big, it's something
new, it's something no Java developer can live without these days:

Generics.

That's right; use generics (or enums, or foreach loops - annotations,
on the other hand, are quite reasonably supported) and JDEE will, at
best, get confused.  Part of the reason is that JDEE uses [http://www.beanshell.org/ BeanShell]
underneath; BSH is, sadly, unmaintained and lacks support for Java 5
features.

== So why not use an IDE? ==

Because, in my arrogant opinion, the current crop of IDEs is complete
and utter crap, not worth the bits to store or the CPU cycles to run
(and *definitely* not worth the enormous amounts of memory they
require).  I have a major rant brewing on this subject; watch [http://blog.grumblesmurf.org/ my
blog] if you care.

You see, when it comes down to brass tacks, code is really just text.
And Emacs beats any other text editor out there hands down (vi lovers,
I hear you; I like vi, too, but Emacs is just *better*).

== What malabar-mode offers ==

Since malabar-mode is derived from java-mode, we get some things for free:

- Syntax highlighting

- Movement commands (C-M-f/-b is a winner; so is M-f/-b, especially
  with c-subword-mode turned on)

- Electric punctuation

There's lots more; and since this is Emacs, you can turn off or modify
anything you don't like.

But there is more:
------------------

- Tight integration with [http://maven.apache.org Maven]

- A [http://groovy.codehaus.org/ Groovy] console for rapid prototyping and exploratory programming

- [http://www.junit.org/ JUnit] integration, both for running tests standalone and through Maven

- Import help; import one class or all needed classes in the buffer
  (with prompting if the class name is ambiguous)

- Extend class / implement interface / override method helpers

- Simplistic refactorings

and more.

== Installation ==

1. You probably already have Emacs (if not, go get it right now.  I'll
   wait).  However, for this beast, you will need Emacs 23.

   Warning, warning, Ubuntu users: The Intrepid emacs-snapshot package
   is too old (strangely enough, by about eight days).  The Jaunty
   snapshot package should work, but you should consider getting the
   release (23.1 at the time of writing).  Compiling your own Emacs
   isn't hard.

2. Get CEDET_ and arrange for it to be on your Emacs load-path (I
   develop using CVS HEAD; older versions may or may not work),
   e.g. by linking the CEDET directory into your site-lisp directory.

3. Clone the repository from [git://github.com/espenhw/malabar-mode.git here].
   
4. Build with ``mvn package``.  If load-test.el fails, it is most
   likely because CEDET is not on your load-path.

   Note that since malabar-mode HEAD tracks Maven 3.0-SNAPSHOT
   directly, it may fail to work (or even compile) due to upstream
   changes.  I usually fix such breakage reasonably quickly, so don't
   despair (or even better, if you notice breakage you can fix it
   yourself and send me a patch...)

   If you really really need a working version Right Now[TM] you can
   always use the ``malabar-1.1`` tag.

   When a Maven (pre)release is made, I will tag a version of
   malabar-mode that locks to that version.

5. Unpack the resulting ``malabar-<version>-dist.zip`` somewhere
   
6. Add ``malabar-<version>/lisp`` to your Emacs load-path
   
7. Add the following to your .emacs::

     (require 'cedet)
     (semantic-load-enable-minimum-features) ;; or enable more if you wish
     (require 'malabar-mode)
     (setq malabar-groovy-lib-dir "/path/to/malabar/lib")
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.java\\'" . malabar-mode))

8. (optional) If you want to mimic the IDEish compile-on-save
   behaviour, add the following as well::

     (add-hook 'malabar-mode-hook
          (lambda () 
            (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'malabar-compile-file-silently
                      nil t))
          
== Usage ==

Here is a list of available interactive commands, with default
keybindings where applicable:

malabar-compile-file : C-c C-v C-c
  Compiles the current file.

malabar-clear-typecache
  Clears the type cache (used for code completion) if it gets
  confused.  If you have to use this often, please file a bug.
  
malabar-extend-class : C-c C-v C-e
  Prompts for a class, adds stub implementations of all that class's
  abstract methods and accessible constructors and inserts the
  appropriate extends clause.

malabar-groovy-start
  Start the Groovy console, or pop to it if it is running.

malabar-groovy-stop
  Kill the Groovy console process.

malabar-implement-interface : C-c C-v C-i
  Prompts for an interface, adds stub implementations of all that
  interface's methods and adds the interface to the class's implements
  clause.

malabar-import-all : C-c C-v z
  Adds import statements for all unqualified classes in the buffer, as
  if by performing ``malabar-import-one-class`` on each.

malabar-import-one-class : C-c C-v C-z
  Adds an import statement for a single unqualified class (defaults to
  the symbol at point).  If more than one class matches the
  unqualified name you will be asked which class to import.

  The variable ``malabar-import-excluded-classes-regexp-list``
  contains a list of regular expressions; if one of these matches the
  qualified class name, the class will be excluded from import.  The
  default value excludes classes from ``java.lang``, JRE internal
  classes and inner classes.

malabar-run-maven-command
  Prompts for and executes an (almost) arbitrary Maven command line.
  Honors profile activation, property definitions and lifecycle
  phases/goals.  E.g.: ``-DskipTests=true -Pdev-mode install`` will
  run the install lifecycle with the dev-mode profile active, skipping
  tests.

malabar-install-project : C-c C-v C-b
  Runs ``mvn install`` on your project.  With prefix argument (C-u),
  cleans the project first (``mvn clean install``).

malabar-override-method : C-c C-v C-o
  Prompts for an eligible method from the superclass of the class at
  point and adds a stub implementation of that method.  If the chosen
  method is one of ``Object.equals`` or ``Object.hashCode``, override both of them.

malabar-run-all-tests : C-c C-v M-t
  Runs ``mvn test`` on your project.  With prefix argument (C-u),
  cleans the project first (``mvn clean test``).
  
malabar-run-junit-test-no-maven : C-c C-v C-t
  Compiles the current file, performs
  ``malabar-visit-corresponding-test``, compiles that file (if not the
  same as where we started) and runs the now-current buffer as a
  standalone JUnit test.

malabar-run-test : C-c C-v t
  Runs the corresponding test to this buffer using Maven (``mvn test -Dtest=classname``)

malabar-update-package
  Updates the package statement of the current buffer to match its place
  in the source directory.

malabar-visit-corresponding-test
  Visits the corresponding test class; that is, the file in the
  parallel src/test/java hierarchy that matches the class in the
  current buffer (with ``malabar-test-class-suffix`` appended).

  E.g., ``M-x malabar-visit-corresponding-test`` in a buffer visiting
  ``src/main/java/org/grumblesmurf/malabar/MvnServer.java`` will visit
  the file
  ``src/test/java/org/grumblesmurf/malabar/MvnServerTest.java`` with
  the default value of ``malabar-test-class-suffix``.

  If the current buffer looks like a test class, this command does nothing.

malabar-visit-project-file : C-c C-v C-p
  Visit the project file, that is the closest file named ``pom.xml``
  searching upwards in the directory structure.

malabar-jump-to-thing : C-c C-v C-y
  Jumps to the definition of the 'thing' at point. More technically,
  uses ``semantic-analyze-current-context`` output to identify an origin
  for the code at point, taking type membership into account.  This
  function is much like ``semantic-ia-fast-jump``, only a little
  smarter.

malabar-refactor-extract-constant : C-c C-v C-r C-c
  Extracts the thing at point as a named constant.  The scope of the
  constant will default to
  ``malabar-refactor-extract-constant-default-scope``, but with a
  prefix arg will prompt for the scope.

In addition, [http://cedet.sourceforge.net/intellisense.shtml standard Semantic code completion] is available; trigger
this however you wish.  By default, ``semantic-ia-complete-symbol`` is
bound to ``C-c C-v C-.`` and ``semantic-ia-complete-symbol-menu`` is
bound to ``C-c C-v .``.

== Abbrevs ==

Some default abbrevs are set up, see the variable
``malabar-case-fixed-abbrevs`` for the current list.

Note the presence of the ``#Test`` abbrev; this expands to::

     @Test
     public void |() throws Exception {
         fail("Unfinished test");
     }

With point left at the position marked with ``|``.

== Electric expansions ==

In addition to the electric insertion offered by CC-mode, malabar-mode
offers an expansion that simulates the [http://groovy.codehaus.org/Operators#Operators-ElvisOperator%28%3F%3A%29 Elvis operator], although the
generated code is not as efficient as a language-provided Elvis
operator would be.  This expansion is controlled by the variable
``malabar-electric-elvis-p``.

== This is cool, I want to help ==

Github has excellent support for forking!  If you don't want to go
that far, git is, after all, a *distributed* VCS.  Just commit to your
local repository and then use git-format-patch to extract patches in a
useful format.

=== But where do I send patches? ===

To the [http://github.com/espenhw/malabar-mode/issues issue tracker] (see the next section).

=== I found a bug! ===

Good for you.  Create a ticket in the [http://github.com/espenhw/malabar-mode/issues issue tracker] and stuff will happen.

Hint #1:  Tell me what you did, what you expected to happen and what
actually happened.  Include any error messages (Emacs backtraces,
output in the buffers named starting with ``*Malabar``, interesting
stuff from ``*Messages*`` etc.).

Hint #2:  Bugs with patches tend to be fixed faster (see the previous
section).
