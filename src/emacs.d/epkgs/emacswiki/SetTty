If you do a 'describe-key' for C-x C-c you will see that the key
combination is mapped to 'C-x C-g'. This might help:

export CYGWIN="tty"
</pre>

   (note from jimv at iwaynet dot net:  when I try this, for some
    reason stty gets set to '-echo' as I leave emacs.  So, I can't
    see what I type at the cygwin prompt after I exit emacs, and
    trying to fix it with 'stty echo' fails.  Instead of using
    'export' in the cygwin environment, I just edited the batch file
    I use to launch the cygwin bask from my desktop:  Add
    'set CYGWIN=tty' right before the call to bash.  This fixes
    everything for me.)

The following thread discusses the problem.
