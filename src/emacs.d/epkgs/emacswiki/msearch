Highlight all matches of text dragged with the mouse in the current buffer.

I use msearch for debugging of automatically generated source code.
Usually, there are hundreds of variables and equations in such code.
Msearch allows to swiftly change the search string only using the mouse.
This makes it easier to trace back how a variable gets its current value through a sequence of equations and assignments.

See the [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Comments_on_msearch|Talk Page]] for user comments about msearch.

== Bug reports / error correction ==
Peter made me aware of some bugs/misbehaviour of msearch:

* DONE: Spelling: "lightes" -> "lights".
* DONE: Consistency: "high-lights" -> "highlights".
* DONE: Installation: mention "(required 'cl)" also (or don't depend on cl).
* DONE (I have added a note that one should inspect the customization group msearch.): Document assigning msearch-case-fold-search-start.  The current
  documentation brought up by "C-h m" is "Mouse-drag high-lightes all
  corresponding matches within the current buffer."  but doesn't tell
  the user which variables control its behavior.
* DONE (this can now be customized): Document word vs. symbol mode.  Maybe just have "word mode", and if
  the user wants to customize a variable specifying what constitutes
  word characters then they can
* DONE: When changing option in menu, it would be nice if the change applied
  to the buffer(s).
* DONE (Added a message "Msearch string at point not meeting boundary conditions."): It's consistent but a little confusing when in word mode to select
  part of a word and have what you selected not be highlighted
  (because it's not a complete word).  I don't know of a good way to
  solve this and it's acceptable the way it is.
* TODO (maybe): It would be logical in word mode that if you highlighted the first
  part of a word that it would highlight that and everything else that
  was also the first part of a word, and similarly for the middle and
  ends.  So if you hilighted "ab" in "abcde" it would highlight the
  first two letters of "abacus" and "ab" but not the "ab" in "tab".
  This may be more complicated than you want to get into.
 * DONE: The menu item name "case-fold-search" is an Emacs-internal variable name but not very friendly to the user; even Emacs itself uses "Ignore Case for Search" in its menu; I think  
 "Ignore Case" would be a good name for the Msearch menu item.
* DONE (I have changed it to "Search String Boundaries"): In the menu I would say "Word Mode" instead of "Consistence".  The latter is logical but maybe a confusing term.
* DONE: The "Help On msearch" menu item could be just "Help" and be at the end.
