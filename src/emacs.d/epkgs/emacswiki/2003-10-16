I saw a posting on emacs-devel by larsi...  and sure enough, LarsMagneIngebrigtsen seems to be back.

Later, on #gnus:

 sheskar has set the topic for #gnus: "No Gnus to start soon."
 <ore> yes!
 <ore> Larsi's catching up on ding
 <ore> that's a sure sign
 <ore> usually happens around Christmas

Does this mean that he is Santa Claus? :-)
