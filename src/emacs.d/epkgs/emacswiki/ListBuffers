By default, using `C-x C-b' will call `list-buffers' with BufferMenu. The list of buffers is displayed in another window. If you want to use it in order to switch buffers, you will have to hit `C-x o' to switch windows, first.
This is a very crude way of switching buffers.

The following code will eliminate the need for `C-x o', making list-buffers much easier to use:

    (global-set-key (kbd "\C-x\C-b") 'buffer-menu-other-window)
