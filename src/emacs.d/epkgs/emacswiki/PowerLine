=== Emacswiki version ===

Lisp:powerline.el was first released here on the Emacswiki by Nicolas Rougier and later improved by Chen Yuan.

=== Donald Ephraim Curtis' version ===

https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline

I have rewritten this package and am hosting the repository on Github.  My version uses many of the techniques in the original---posted here---but tries to make it easier to add new things.  Please submit issues there and any of your own mode-line themes using PowerLine --DonaldCurtis
==== Evil integration ====
available at https://github.com/laynor/emacs-conf/blob/master/packages/sm-package-powerline.el

=== Jonathan Chu's version ===

Another variant based on the original powerline.

=== Another version ===

https://github.com/Dewdrops/powerline

Forked from Donald Ephraim Curtis' version and provides better Evil integration.
