== Debugging and Reporting Icicles Bugs ==

You can report a problem you experience with '''Icicles''' at '''IciclesIssuesOpen''' -- please follow the formatting suggestion provided there.


But the best way to report an '''Icicles''' issue or pass along a
suggestion is by email.  Do one of the following:

* Choose item `##Send Bug Report##' from menu-bar menu '''Icicles'''.

* Use `M-x icicle-send-bug-report'.

* Use `##M-?##' from the minibuffer.  Then click button `##Icicles
Options and Faces##' in buffer `*Help*'.  Then click the link
  `##Send Bug Report##' in buffer `##*Customize Group: icicles*##'.

When you report a problem, please always mention your Emacs
version and platform (e.g. Windows, GNU/Linux).  If you are not
using the latest Icicles files, mention which ones you are using.
Icicles files each have an `##Update ###' field in the header, which
identifies the file exactly.

If you can include a debugger backtrace in your email, that helps
-- see the next section.

=== Debugging Tips ===

1. If you use the debugger to report a backtrace, first delete (or
   move out of your `load-path') all '''Icicles''' byte-compiled files,
   so that you use only the source files (`##icicles*.el##') for
   debugging.

2. Set `debug-on-error' to `t', so that if an error is raised you
   get a debugger backtrace.

3. If you want to enter the debugger at a particular point and
   step through the execution, you can either use `M-x debug-on-entry' (to enter the debugger whenever you enter a
   given function) or temporarily place breakpoint calls to the
   debugger -- ##(debug)## -- in the source code and reevaluate the
   enclosing function definition.

4. When in the debugger, use `d' to step through the execution or
   `c' to skip over a particular step (execute it to completion,
   skipping over the details).  Use `q' to exit the debugger.  An
   alternative to using the regular debugger is to use `edebug' -
   some people prefer that.

Remember to load only the source files -- a backtrace from
byte-compiled code is not very useful.  Include the backtrace in your
bug report.
