    NEWS: 2019-01-31: emacs-w3m has launched an official git repository on
                      github https://github.com/emacs-w3m/emacs-w3m ,
                      including support there for project-specific wiki.


= Description =

'''emacs-w3m''', also known on this wiki as [::WThreeM],
is an emacs internet browser and interface to
the [[w3m]] text browser.  It supports tabs (ie. multiple buffers), images, https, cookies, history, bookmarks, asynchronous operation, session management, a form of "filtering" similar to firefox's greasemonkey, and more.  Note that it has nothing to do
with the [[w3]] or the [[eww]] web browsers written entirely in EmacsLisp.  Using
the Emacs interface to w3m is much faster than using w3, since the
parsing and displaying is done by the external w3m process.

Though you can download an old static release of emacs-w3m from its
homepage at http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org, please note that since 2005
the project has operated on a rolling-release model, based upon its
CVS repository, and as of 2019-01-31, its github repository
(https://github.com/emacs-w3m/emacs-w3m). There also exists a
convenient un-official third-party mirror on MELPA, allowing you to
directly install the package.

There are English and Japanese language mailing-lists.  Their archives are
available at the website.  The lists are also archived and gatewayed on
Gmane, as <code>gmane.emacs.w3m</code>.  Emacs-w3m comes with a manual
in TexInfo format, from which a normal, comfortable section of the manual in
InfoMode form will be built by the installation process.

[new:PhilHudson:2013-03-24 12:10 UTC]
If you are building from cvs, be aware of one gotcha: if the first ##emacs## executable in your ##$PATH## is a symlink, then the directory containing that symlink will be used as the base install location by ##make install##. Fix: either change ##$PATH## to expose the actual installed ##emacs## binary first, at least for the duration of the configure/make/install procedure, or hand-edit the ##Makefile## created by running ##./configure##.


== Basic Setup ==
{{{
 (setq browse-url-browser-function 'w3m-browse-url)
 (autoload 'w3m-browse-url "w3m" "Ask a WWW browser to show a URL." t)
 ;; optional keyboard short-cut
 (global-set-key "\C-xm" 'browse-url-at-point)
}}}
=== GUI Desktop Integration ===

If your GUI desktop complies with the freedesktop standard, you can have
all your GUI programs open links in emacs-w3m instead of, say, firefox or chrome.
Most linux desktops are compliant (eg. gnome, kde, xfce, lxde)

1. Create a file <code>emacs-w3m.desktop</code>. Here's an example:
{{{
[Desktop Entry]
Name=emacs-w3m
GenericName=Emacs Web Browser
X-GNOME-FullName=Emacs w3m Web Browser

Encoding=UTF-8
Version=1.0
Comment=Using emacsclient
NoDisplay=true

Exec=emacsclient --eval "(browse-url (replace-regexp-in-string \"'\" \"\" \"%u\"))"

Terminal=false
X-MultipleArgs=false
Type=Application
Icon=firefox-esr
Categories=Network;WebBrowser;
StartupWMClass=Firefox-esr
StartupNotify=true
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/unknown;x-scheme-handler/about;text/html;text/xml;application/xhtml+xml;application/xml;application/vnd.mozilla.xul+xml;application/rss+xml;application/rdf+xml;image/gif;image/jpeg;image/png;x-scheme-handler/http;x-scheme-handler/https;
}}}

2. Save your <code>emacs-w3m.desktop</code> file in an appropriate place. If you want the change to be applied system-wide for all users, that would be <code>/usr/local/share/application/</code>. For a single user, the correct location would be <code>~/.local/share/applications</code>.

3. run <code>xdg-settings set default-web-browser emacs-w3m.desktop</code>.
