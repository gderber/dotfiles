Hi, I love emacs. Especially dired, tramp and comint. Not to the mention the whole idea of inferior lisp mode, etc etc.

: Welcome on the wiki !

I uploaded:
* PerlmonksEl - Emacs interface to www.perlmonks.org
* Daniel Polani's ShellCurrentDirectory and I hope you enjoy it.
* AsciidocEl - asciidoc support for emacs.
* ColorThemeRandom - randomly select a color theme - every (random n) minutes!


My personal homepage is http://www.LivingCosmos.org and my professional homepage is
http://www.metaperl.com

I am a big fan of EmacsHumor and love the idea of the ChurchOfEmacs
