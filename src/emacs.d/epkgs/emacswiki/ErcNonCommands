This module is enabled by default.  To disable it use M-x customize-variable RET erc-modules.

/-commands which are not sent to the server are considered non-commands.  Only the results of these commands are displayed in the buffer, not the command.

To add non-commands, add something like the following to your ~/.emacs:

    (add-to-list 'erc-noncommands-list 'erc-cmd-FOO)
