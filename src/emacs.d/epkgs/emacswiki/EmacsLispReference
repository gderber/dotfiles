'''The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual''' (also known as the [::elisp] or [::lispref]) manual, is documentation about the language used to extend Emacs, EmacsLisp.

GnuEmacs has an EmacsManual, an EmacsLispIntro, and an EmacsLispReference.  Starting with Emacs 22, all three manuals are included.

XEmacs has an XEmacs User's Manual, an XEmacs Lisp Reference Manual, a introduction to XEmacs ("Getting Started With XEmacs"), an EmacsLisp introduction ("Programming in Emacs Lisp, an Introduction"), and an XEmacs Internals Manual, all distributed with XEmacs.

The best way is to simply use the manual within Emacs.  Then you can simply use the Help menu or type <tt>C-h i</tt> to view it, along with all the other documentation in the info system.  If your Emacs doesn't come with the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual, you will have to download it.  All manuals are available online in various formats.

For GNU Emacs:

* http://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html
* http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html
* Available in print from the GnuPress.

To get the manual into Emacs on Debian GNU/Linux or when you can't see an Elisp section after doing M-x info, or if you get the error "Info file elisp does not exist", then you need to:

# Activate a *non-free* section in your /etc/apt/sources.list
# Install the *emacs23-common-non-dfsg* package (or the one for your emacs version)

The manual has license GFDL and thus the DFSG (Debian Free Software Guidelines) don't consider it /free/.

You can link to the index entries in the manual using the Manual prefix.
Command, Variable, and Concept index entries can be linked.
If the entries contain punctuation or whitespace characters, you will
need to put them in double square brackets:

* ##Manual:apropos## -> Manual:apropos
* ##[[Manual:,@ (with Backquote)]]## -> [[Manual:,@ (with Backquote)]]

The XEmacs Lisp Reference Manual, as well as all the other manuals, are available at:

According to DanielLaLiberte, the ''[http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=6b82c009-4c0b-43d8-a17d-af485b65ac48@r66g2000hsg.googlegroups.com history of the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual]'':

: ''Starting with Emacs 17, and transitioning to Emacs 18, I was trying to
develop a rather substantial extension and I was forced to learn what
I could from the very limited doc strings, and the source itself.  I
started putting together a document for my own use of all the
functions, variables, etc, and at some point started sharing this with
others.  I didn't think I had time to really finish this
documentation, but I recall announcing my offer to coordinate the
efforts of others if they would help out.''

: ''With a group of about a dozen volunteers, we hobbled along for a year
or so, and then we learned that Bil Lewis had offered to write up a
first draft of the entire manual, which he then did in cooperation
with our group.  I received his work as it was being written and
edited it, reorganizing the material substantially over the next year
or two.  My graduate research work was delayed as a result, but I was
having fun, getting into it and receiving the reward of compliments
from grateful readers.   I'd have to say that most of the first year
of work was overwritten a couple times by this process, so we probably
dropped some of the minor acknowledgments as well.''

: ''Although I had a major hand in every chapter, the one on the Edebug
source-level debugger was all mine, of course, since I had written the
software.  Having mastered everything about the language and
environment, it became obvious to me in a flash how to build Edebug,
and the first version was hacked out in a couple weeks.  This little
diversion turned into a major project, and a new subject for my
masters research.''

: ''Shortly before Emacs 19 started to come out, I was finishing up the
indexing (including a very useful permuted index) and we were "done"
and then RMS wanted to take control.  After a few more months of his
reediting, cleaning up all my rampant use of passive voice and such,
it was published in a two-volume book.   Later editions by RMS and
others incorporated the Emacs 19 features.  I got back into my
research and lost touch.''
