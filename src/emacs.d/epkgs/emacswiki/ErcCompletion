[[Completion]] is enabled by default (to disable it, use M-x customize-variable RET erc-modules).

== Nick Completion ==

You can complete on all channel members using TAB.

There are two modules to achieve this:

* Old-style, using hippie-expand, in erc-complete.el
* New, using ProgrammableCompletion, in erc-pcomplete.el
       <-- that page is somewhat outdated   

Use the old style only if you do not have pcomplete on your system.

== Command Completion ==

Completion also works with ErcCommands.

== New Style ==

Enabled by default.

== Old Style ==

Old style completion had a feature that was never used:  You could
reduce completion to you pals only (maybe this was supposed to be
useful on very full channels such as #debian).  In order to use it,
set the variable `erc-nick-completion'.

You can set it to either 'all, 'pals, or a function named
`erc-nick-completion-exclude-myself' to determine what the list of
possible completions look like.  Of course you can also write your own
function to provide a list of possible completions.  This is no longer
supported in the new-style completion.
