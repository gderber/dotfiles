That's a pretty broad category that will have significant overlap with CategoryModes. Maybe we should move some stuff from CategoryModes to this category?

If that's what you want, I could extract the "data" modes from CategoryModes to a DataModes subpage and reference DataModes from the CategoryData page.

As a new user, I was reluctant to shift around the existing organization.

That sounds like an excellent solution.

That is in general a much better approach, IMO.  Create a normal page first, ''within an existing category'' (or categories).  After use and discussion, we can decide later whether to promote it to a category.

I wish you would do likewise with ''all'' of the categories you have created recently: turn them into regular pages, perhaps reorganize the category page (e.g. group related links pertaining to your new "subcategory" page), and -- after some use -- open a discussion to promote your new page as a category.

If everything has now been moved to DataModes, can you please delete page CategoryData (and replace any links to it)?

I don't understand the last comment: There was a section on the Data page listing modes for /editing/ data with just one entry (CSV files). This one entry was moved to the DataModes page. No further changes to the Data category page seem to be required?

I misunderstood.  I thought you were talking about replacing CategoryData by an ordinary page DataModes.  My bad.
