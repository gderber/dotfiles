= Remove Server Part from mode line =

To remove the server part from the channel identifyer in the mode line, customize
`erc-mode-line-format' and change <code>"%s"</code> to <code>"%t"</code>.

= Auto ghost yourself =

When you have a bad connections which keeps dropping, you'll want to ghost your nick automatically. You can do this with this function:

<pre>
(defun erc-ghost-maybe (server nick)
  "Send GHOST message to NickServ if NICK ends with `erc-nick-uniquifier'.
The function is suitable for `erc-after-connect'."
  (when (string-match (format "\\(.*?\\)%s+$" erc-nick-uniquifier) nick)
    (let ((nick-orig (match-string 1 nick))
          (password erc-session-password))
      (when (y-or-n-p (format "Current nick is '%s'. Do you want to ghost?"
                              nick))
        (erc-message "PRIVMSG" (format "NickServ GHOST %s %s"
				       nick-orig password))
	(erc-cmd-NICK nick-orig)
	(erc-message "PRIVMSG" (format "NickServ identify %s %s"
				       nick-orig password))))))
(add-hook 'erc-after-connect 'erc-ghost-maybe)

</pre>

It will prompt when it detects that you are not using your default nick. You can remove the "(when (y-or-n-p..." condition if you don't want the prompt.
Note: this function doesn't work if the last letter of your nick is the same as `erc-nick-uniquifier'.

= Do not use whitespace-mode in ERC =

Enabling `whitespace-mode' in an ERC buffer removes colors and other styles from all text in the buffer. This is not obvious and especially annoying for `global-whitespace-mode' users, as disabling `whitespace-mode' does not fix the lack of colors/styles.

<pre>
(setq whitespace-global-modes '(not erc-mode))
</pre>
