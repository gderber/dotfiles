Moved to *HTTPS* and installed *new CSS* by BrianBurns, as indicated a while ago ([[2016-01-04]]).
Let me know if anything breaks. You can also try out the [EmacsWiki:action=browse;id=CSS;css=/light.css;theme=dark Dark] variant of the same theme.

You can report CSS issues [https://github.com/bburns/emacswiki-light-theme/issues on GitHub].
There's some discussion [https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/42dqdg/emacswiki_theme_v2/ on reddit]
and [https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-tangents/2016-01/msg00014.html emacs-tangents] (a mailing list).

Remember: if you don't like it, visit the [[CSS]] page and pick a different theme.
When I'm feeling nostalgic, I go with the [Self:action=browse;id=CSS;theme=;css=/css/emacs.css Classic Theme], for example.
I think it's also the one DrewAdams prefers.
