The spelling module integrates FlySpell with ERC for on-the-fly spell checking.
It enables `flyspell-mode' in every ERC buffer and makes sure that only lines you type are checked.

To use, enable `erc-spelling-mode':

    (erc-spelling-mode 1)


The module has a feature that allows for channel-specific
dictionaries using the `erc-spelling-dictionaries' alist:

    (setq erc-spelling-dictionaries '(("irc.tu-ilmenau.de" "german-new8")
                                      ("#starwars" "american")))

This will make sure that the ##german-new8## dictionary is active on all
buffers of irc.tu-ilmenau.de, except for in channel #starwars, which will retain
the default ##american## dictionary. If you don't need different
dictionaries for channels but can live with the default one, you don't
have to worry about this.

In the above, when selecting the dictionary, I had to append the port to which I connect on the server string.
For exemple:

    (setq erc-spelling-dictionaries '(("irc.tu-ilmenau.de:6667" "german-new8")
                                      ("#starwars" "american")))
