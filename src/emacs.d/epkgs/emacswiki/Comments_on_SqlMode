I'm new to emacs.
When trying the sql-mysql, I got the error message as below:
Unable to locate SQL Program 'mysql'.

Appreciate your help :)

Emacs will use a command line client to communicate to the database. Do you have it installed and is it called `mysql'?

If it is, and it works from a terminal but not within Emacs, then you need to add its directory to `exec-path' (which ought to match the PATH environment variable, so there's definitely something unexpected going on...)

Below the Miscellaneous Settings heading there is the code for this:
"When using sql-send-region to execute a query in a SQLi buffer, the table formatting is off because the column names are printed on the same row as the the prompt. By adding a newline before the comint output we can make sure everything lines up nice. This will add a preceding newline to every comint output, even queries run at the prompt - though the extra line isn’t too noticeable."
I paste the code into ~/.emacs. After I start again Emacs I open an sql file. Then I set product to sqlite. Then I start sql cli buffer with C-c C-z. Here I get the following error:

user-error: End of defaults; no next item [6 times]

Then when in my sql file I hit C-c C-b I get again this error:

So what is wrong here?
