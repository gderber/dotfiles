Click on the heading to find all pages related to window management in Emacs.

== Emacs Windows - Basics ==

* [[Window]] -- what a window is in Emacs
* WindowConfiguration -- what a window configuration is
* ModeLine, ModeLinePosition -- the mode-line of a window



[:Navigation]
== Windows Navigation (Selection) ==

Move among windows -- alternatives to `C-x o' (`other-window').

* Use arrow keys to choose
** WindMove
** WindowNavigation
** [[windcycle]]
* Use a window name or number to choose
** [[Icicles]]: `C-u C-x o' in Icicle mode -- Cycle/filter/complete window names to choose a window
** NumberedWindows
** Lisp:switch-window.el shows big numbers in each window, you input the number to get where you want to.
** WindowNumberingMode
* Use a transient keymap to move among windows
** WinSwitch -- a dynamic, transient mode that enables easy, efficient navigation among windows (and frames)
* `M-x next-multiframe-window' -- similar to `other-window' but cycles both through windows and frames.

== Resizing, Splitting,... Windows ==

* DoReMi -- Resize windows incrementally, using arrow keys or mouse wheel. Hold Meta key to boost resizing increment.
* HorizontalSplitting -- Force Emacs to always use split-window-horizontally instead of split-window for temporary buffers, like C-x C-b and describe-function.
* OneWindow -- Make Emacs always use only one window for whatever it does
* TransposeWindows -- Rearrange windows within a [[Frame]]
* ToggleWindowSplit -- Toggle between vertical and horizontal split
* TransposeFrame -- Transpose windows arrangement in a [[Frame]]
* WidenWindow -- Widen the active window
* WindowResize -- Resize windows using simple keybindings
* ThreeWindows -- Enjoy your work in three windows per [[Frame]]. One big and two small. 
* QuickTiling -- If you like xmonad, tmux etc., chances are you'll this too.
* GridLayout -- how to quickly split the frame into a grid
* PlaceWindows ([[place-windows.el]]) -- place active windows according to number of rows, incrementally or with universal argument. Each row height is equal, each column height equal in current row.

== Switching Window Configurations ==

* WinnerMode -- Undo and redo changes to the window configuration
* WindowsAndRegisters -- Store window configurations in registers
* EmacsLispScreen (elscreen.el) -- Switch between numbered screens with the C-\ prefix command
* EmacsScreen (escreen.el) -- same thing
* PolicySwitch -- Manage lists of window configurations as policies.  Persistence across sessions.
* WinRing -- Switch between named window configurations ("mail", "irc", "gnus" etc.) using prefix key `C-x 7'.
* WindowsMode -- Open new configurations, keep track of them, and store them to disk (SessionManagement)
* LayoutRestore -- Save multi-window layout and restore it
* CategorizingInformationManager -- Ee-windows for switching between window configurations
* RecursiveEditPreservingWindowConfig -- Temporarily change the window configuration using RecursiveEdit
* BFocus ([[bfocus.el]]) -- Temporarly fill a frame with a window and then change back to previous configuration
* WorkgroupsForWindows -- A simple window-configuration persistence package

* CategoryBufferSwitching -- Rather than switching window configurations, maybe you just want to switch buffers?


== Frame Configurations ==

To save the current configuration of ''[[frame]]s'' and later restore it, use `C-x r f' (`frame-configuration-to-register') and `C-x r j' (`jump-to-register'), respectively. See FramesAndRegisters.

'''See also:'''

* DoReMi -- Commands to resize and move frames incrementally, using the arrow keys or mouse wheel.
* [[FrameModes#FrameCommands]] -- Commands to manipulate frames:
** Iconify/hide all frames and restore them using `C-M-z'.
** Resize and move frames incrementally, using the arrow keys.
** Tile all visible frames horizontally or vertically. Particularly useful before comparing buffers with Ediff.
* [[Shrink-Wrapping Frames]] -- Commands to resize frames.
