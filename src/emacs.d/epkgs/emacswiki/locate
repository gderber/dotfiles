<code>M-x locate</code> allows you to use unix <code>locate</code> command.\\
Usually I want case insensitive search.\\
It can be done via <code>C-u M-x locate</code> and then adding <code>-i</code> argument to locate call.\\
If you want it to be a default behaviour just add the following to your <code>.emacs</code>:
{{{
(defun my-locate-make-command-line (search-string)
  "Make an insensitive locate command line"
  (list locate-command "-i" search-string))

(setq locate-make-command-line 'my-locate-make-command-line)
}}}

* '''[[Icicles]]''' [[multi-command]] `<tt>[[Icicles_-_File-Name_Input#FindFilesAnywhere|icicle-locate]]</tt>', which lets you search Unix `locate' hits case-sensitively or insensitively.  And you can toggle case sensitivity on the fly.
