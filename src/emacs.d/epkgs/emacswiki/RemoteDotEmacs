This is rather cool, it is from an email (2006-04-25) on help-gnu-emacs mailing list.
The author is Anselm Helbig:

maybe this works for you: put the following lines in all your .emacs
files, and put the rest on a web server:

  (defun my-eval-url-callback ()
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (re-search-forward "^\r?$" nil 1)
    (delete-region (point-min) (point))
    (eval-buffer))

  (url-retrieve "http://example.org/emacs.el" 'my-eval-url-callback)

i tested this only superficially. i, too, use version control (darcs)
for my .emacs.

Here are more ways to do it:

I do a similar thing, but use unison which is a file synchroniser
rather than a version control. Works like a charm and has the
advantage over a remote .emacs that it works when the network is down!
