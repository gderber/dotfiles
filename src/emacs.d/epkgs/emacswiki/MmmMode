== Overview ==

Multiple Major Modes by MichaelAbrahamShulman. This one is used on the OracleProC page.

It was once the method of choice for combining major modes, development stalled from 2004-2011, and restarted mid-2012.

You can find description of using it, together with psgml-mode, php-mode, javascript-mode and css-mode to edit HTML files at HtmlModeDeluxe.

== MMM Mode for Emacs 24 & Beyond ==

The development has moved from SourceForge to GitHub, and the issue tracker with it: https://github.com/purcell/mmm-mode/issues
