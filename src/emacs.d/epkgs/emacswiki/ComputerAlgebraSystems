The following are Emacs interfaces to computer algebra systems.  Some of these are proprietary or have parts that are non-free.  Alternative packages that are free software are listed in [http://directory.fsf.org/math/ the Mathematics category of the Free Software Directory].

* [http://maxima.sourceforge.net Maxima] -- the Emacs interface is part of the distro.
** [http://members3.jcom.home.ne.jp/imaxima/ imaxima.el] -- a really hardcore awesome Maxima interface.
* [http://yacas.sourceforge.net/homepage.html Yet Another Computer Algebra System] -- the Emacs interface is part of the distro.
* MuPAD -- a non-free computer algebra system, the Emacs interface is MuPACS
* [http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~gap/ GAP] -- a link for the Emacs interface is at   ~/Info4/deposit.html
* [http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/4567 math.el] -- for running (non-free) Mathematica under Emacs (Alternatively [http://www.watson.org/~mccann/mathematica.el mathematica.el])
* PariGP -- Pari/GP with <nowiki>PariEmacs</nowiki>
* [http://www.sagemath.org SAGE] -- Its Emacs interface is at [http://wiki.sagemath.org/Emacs]

And, of course, there's Emacs's built-in computer algebra system,
[AdvancedDeskCalculator Calc].  However it should be said that Calc is
not very graphical, and therefore ill-suited to situations in which
visualisations are necessary (such as work closely related to computer
graphics).
