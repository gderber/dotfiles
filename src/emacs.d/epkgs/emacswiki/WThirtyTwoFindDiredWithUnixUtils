Tried this with gnu emacs on winXP. 

Problem: You get something like

    w:/thomas/fixHtml/:
    find . -exec ls -ld {} \;
    find: missing argument to `-exec'

find exited abnormally with code 1

Solution: 

* Download and unzip unixutils. 
* Put this somewhere in dos PATH. 
* Change dos PATH so the unzipped dir comes first, so unixy find gets found before dos find. (Note: find still works the way you expect when called from explorer.)
* Copy sh to the dir with the other unix utils. (For some reason, when unzipped, the sh program gets put in a different dir.)
* Change shell-file-name to use .sh. 

Find-dired now doesn't produce that error message.

=== With Msys find and customize ===
A different approach is to customize `find-ls-option'. Change `Find Option' from

    -exec ls -ld {} \;

to

    -exec ls -ld {} ;


Due to the way Msys is installed its find comes first in the PATH and Emacs automatically uses the right one.
