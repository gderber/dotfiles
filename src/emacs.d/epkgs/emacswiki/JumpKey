MeatBall:HumaneInterface talks about a JUMP key.  Here's how to have
such a key.  It uses FindFileAtPoint and works similar to GotoAddress.  GotoAddress highlights
URLs and lets button-2 take you there.  The JUMP key doesn't use
highlighting, since you know what you are looking at.  The JUMP key
just does the right thing: Call find-file or browse-url.  

See DedicatedKeys.

<pre>
(defun my-jump ()
  "Jump to the thing at point."
  (interactive)
  (let ((thing (ffap-guesser)))
       (if thing (ffap thing))
    t))
</pre>

* See Lisp:jump.el
A simple package that defines a little more elaborate jump function. The further features are:
** a function to jump in emacswiki (from emacswiki.el) when a wikiname is at point
** a function to follow wikiname when using SimpleWikiEditMode
** a function to follow interwiki name 

Add more functions (for jde-open-class-at-point, for a bookmark nickname at point,for date at point), fix the code...
