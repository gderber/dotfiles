=== Releasing GNU Emacs 22? ===

On the emacs-pretest-bug mailing list, there was a proposal[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2005-11/msg00123.html] about incorporating '''MuPACS''' into GnuEmacs.
Rather than just the proprietary '''MuPAD''' algebra system, MuPACS now supports the
free computer algebra system, '''[http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac.html Giac]'''.  The point of mentioning all this, is that it brought about the following exchange[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2005-11/msg00168.html] between the MuPACS maintainer, and RichardStallman:

    What's the planned schedule for the next emacs release?

 Planned schedule???  Ha ha ha hahaha haha ha!

 Pretesting will start as soon as some lingering problems are fixed.
 So it would be nice to do this soon.
