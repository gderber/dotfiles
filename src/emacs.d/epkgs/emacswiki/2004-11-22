16:00 <talin> bsd is nice
16:01 <forcer> BSD is like setting a slave free, but allowing him to be
    recaptured any time.
16:01 <forcer> GPL gives him an escort :P
16:03 <kensanata> forcer: your analogy assumes that slaves can be copied...
16:03 <forcer> kensanata: come time, come genetics...
16:03 <kensanata> argh.
16:03 <forcer> :P
16:04 <kensanata> would you publish your kids under the GPL?  ;)
16:04 <tintin> haha
16:04 <johnsu01> eek
16:04 <ayrnieu> even without the wonders of science, you can copy slaves -- it
    just takes some time and investment on all sides.
16:04 <johnsu01> Would they have to wear copyright notices all the time?
16:04 <johnsu01> And a copy of the license?
