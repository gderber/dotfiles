The lines that look like:

    (setf stumpwm:*top-level-error-action* :break)


Should be deleted.  This is what the documentation has to say about <code>*top-level-error-action*</code>:

{{{
STUMPWM:*TOP-LEVEL-ERROR-ACTION*
  [symbol]

*TOP-LEVEL-ERROR-ACTION* names a special variable:
  Value: :ABORT
  Documentation:
    If an error is encountered at the top level, in
    STUMPWM-INTERNAL-LOOP, then this variable decides what action
    shall be taken. By default it will print a message to the screen
    and to *standard-output*.
    
    Valid values are :message, :break, :abort. :break will break to the
    debugger. This can be problematic because if the user hit's a
    mapped key the ENTIRE keyboard will be frozen and you will have
    to login remotely to regain control. :abort quits stumpmwm.
}}}

This implies that <code>:break</code> is not a good idea in any case.  But it should not be set in a function like this in any case.  If you really want to do this you can use a <code>let</code> since <code>*top-level-error-action*</code> is a special variable it's value will be propagated to any functions you call.

<code>(in-package :stumpwm)</code> should be added to the top of the extra file.  The present code will work provided <code>*default-package*</code> has the value <code>:stumpwm</code>, which is not it's default value.
