If you want !TextMate-style "fuzzy" file (and other) completion, see [[Icicles - Completion Methods and Styles]] or [InteractivelyDoThings IDO-mode].

If you want automatic indentation of pasted text like in !TextMate, see [[AutoIndentation#SmartPaste|AutoIndentation]].  This is also accomplished by [[auto-indent-mode.el]]

See <tt>[http://code.google.com/p/emacs-textmate/ textmate-mode]</tt> for an attempt of having the !TextMate behaviour for parenthesis and quotes (auto-closing, overwriting, smart delete). Alternatively, AutoPairs.  Note that AutoPairs, doesn't support the M-Return and S-M-Return keys of !TextMate.  This can be done by using [[AutoIndentMode]].

Pair insertion goes hand in hand with (vi-like) OpenNextLine commands.

See WholeLineOrRegion for line-wise copying and cutting when no text is selected.

[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Yasnippet YASnippet] is a template system for Emacs.

If you want !TextMate's Filter Through Command, see ExecuteExternalCommand.

[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/multiple-line-edit.el multiple-line-edit] provides a feature similar to the command "Edit Each Line In Selection".

SpeedBar is similar to the !TextMate's Project Drawer. There's also [EmacsCodeBrowser ECB], and [IdeSkel Ide-skel].

AquamacsEmacs has a lot of !TextMate's key bindings by default.

*Question:* How can I get the equivalent of !TextMate's "Go To File" (Navigation > Go To File, or Command-T) functionality in Emacs? None of the buffer switching techniques I've found really do what %%TextMate%% does -- namely, apply fuzzy completion to all files found in a project. For Emacs, applying fuzzy completion to all files recursively found in a given directory would be awesome.

[new]
*Answer 1*: Use [InteractivelyDoThings Ido] or [[Icicles]] to get %%TextMate%%'s kind of "fuzzy" matching (called "flex" matching in Ido and "scatter" matching in Icicles). Just turn on this kind of matching in Ido or Icicles (##M-(## toggles it in Icicles), and from then on file-name matching will automatically use it. With Icicles you can have fuzzy matching for every kind of input, not just files and buffers. See [[Icicles - Fuzzy Completion#ScatterMatchCompletion|Icicles - Completion Methods and Styles]].

*Answer 2:* Use `find-file-in-project' with [InteractivelyDoThings Ido] or [[Icicles]], to get !TextMate's behavior with regard to projects of files. You can get `find-file-in-project' here: http://github.com/eschulte/rinari/tree/0c3db2ffbdb1f7002c63c510b99d54ad97635776/find-file-in-project.el

*Answer 3:* Use the Emacs [[tags file]] as your project metaphor. The following function uses Ido to select among the files listed in the tags file:

    (defun ido-find-file-in-tag-files ()
      (interactive)
      (save-excursion
        (let ((enable-recursive-minibuffers t)) (visit-tags-table-buffer))
        (find-file (expand-file-name
                    (ido-completing-read "Project file: "
                                         (tags-table-files) nil t)))))

It can be bound to ##C-t## or a similar key for convenience: ##(global-set-key "\C-t" 'ido-find-file-in-tag-files)##

I found this had terrible behavior (emacs seizing up) if I typoed and my typo was not a match in the TAGS file.  The following fixed the issue for me: https://bitbucket.org/durin42/dotfiles/src/tip/.elisp/settings/50.localfuncs.el#cl-9

    (defvar af-ido-flex-fuzzy-limit (* 2000 5))
    (defadvice ido-set-matches-1 (around my-ido-set-matches-1 activate)
        (let ((ido-enable-flex-matching (< (* (length (ad-get-arg 0)) (length ido-text))
                                     af-ido-flex-fuzzy-limit)))
            ad-do-it))

Philipp: Is there an equivalent command that supports TAGS generated by GNU gtags?

*Answer 4:* Use [[Icicles]] [[multi-command]] `icicle-find-file-in-tag-table' to do the same thing as Answer 3 (there's nothing to code). And when you use it, you can also take advantage of [[progressive completion]], [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]] and all of the other Icicles features.
* [[Icicles - Support for Projects#TagsFileProject|Icicles - Tags File Projects]] 
* [[Icicles - File-Name Input#ReadingFileNames|Icicles - File-Name Input]]

*Answer 5:* If you use CScopeAndEmacs, you can search through (and open) all the files referenced in the ##cscope.out## file.

*Answer 6:* If you use the [[Sunrise Commander]], you can narrow the contents of a pane (containing a directory listing or the results of a find or locate operation) with fuzzy matching by pressing C-c /.

*Question:* is there a way to have the same behaviour of Textmate when drag'n'dropping a folder from Finder to the Emacs icon in the dock such that a new Emacs window is opened with a project drawer (i.e. speedbar) that is initialized to browse  the selected folder ?
