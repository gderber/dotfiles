Emacs comes with a tutorial.  It doesn't take long
to go through, and you will better understand and be more productive in Emacs afterward.

* Type `C-h t' (hold down Control while hitting `h', then hit `t').

: If the tutorial command doesn't work, you may have been caught by one of Emacs's CommonProblems.
Try `F1 t', `M-x help-with-tutorial RET' (hold down Meta/Alt key while hitting `x', then type `help', then hit Enter).

To read the tutorial in a language other than english, use
the command `help-with-tutorial-spec-language' (hold down `Alt' while hitting `x', then type `help-with-tutorial-spec-language' and `RET'). Currently available tutorial languages include: `bg', `cn', `cs', `de', `es', `fr', `it', `ja', `ko', `nl', `pl', `ro', `ru', `sk', `sl', `sv',
`th', and `zh'.
