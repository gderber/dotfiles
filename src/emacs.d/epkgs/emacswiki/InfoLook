Usage:

    C-h TAB -- calls `info-lookup-symbol'

or in GNU Emacs 22 or newer, `C-h S'.

== Comments ==
In gnuplot info files menu items do not match the regular expression:
{{{
"\n\\* \\(.*\\): " 
}}}
as it is used in "info-look.el.gz". To make info work with gnuplot-mode I've changed this regexp within the definition of "info-lookup-make-completions" to:
{{{
"\n\\* \\(.*\\):[ :]"
}}}

== Questions ==

Is there a way to make C-h S pop directly to the info manual, rather than being prompted for the command to be searched for?  Thanks.
