Emacs Hangouts are informal virtual meetups hosted on the Google Hangouts on Air platform. Anyone can watch the livestream or recordings without logging in. To participate, you will need a Google account.

SachaChua organizes hangouts on a roughly monthly basis (usually mid-month weekday evening, around 9 PM Toronto time). She would love to help people co-host or organize hangouts at times that are more convenient for their schedule. You can find information about upcoming hangouts on the [http://plus.google.com/108840863190686221561/posts Google+ page for Emacs conferences and hangouts], or [http://eepurl.com/bbi-Ir sign up for e-mail notifications]. Recordings and notes from past hangouts can be found at http://sachachua.com/blog/tag/emacs-hangout .

http://jitsi.org might be an open-source alternative to Google Hangouts on Air, if you would like to organize virtual meetups using alternative tools.
