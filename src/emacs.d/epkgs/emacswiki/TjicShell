tjic-shell.el

This package enhances shell mode to allow a ring of shell buffers.

One keystroke brings a new shell buffer into existance.  Two other keystrokes cycle through all of the shell buffers.  Shell buffers that have been killed are dealt with cleanly and invisibly: the up/down scrolling through shells does the right thing.

Bug reports and feature requests are encouraged.
