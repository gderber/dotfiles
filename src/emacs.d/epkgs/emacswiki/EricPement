I use Emacs. I guess it really started in 1984, when I got my first Kaypro computer.
It used the CP/M operating system and came with two word processors: <nowiki>WordStar</nowiki>
and Perfect Writer. I used both of them quite a bit, and found out years later that
Perfect Writer was an Emacs clone for CP/M: same look, feel, keybindings, commands,
swap file, all the rest. Perfect Writer was nearly bulletproof software--you might lose
a file in <nowiki>WordStar</nowiki>, but never in Perfect Writer.

I graduated to GNU Emacs when I switched to DOS a few years later, and have been using it
ever since. Here are a few things I've tried to contribute to the Emacs community:

* Understanding GNU Emacs and Tabs - http://www.pement.org/emacs_tabs.htm
* Some awk scripts to convert Emacs OutlineMode to real outline formats
** Change to classic format (I, A, 1, a ...) - [http://www.pement.org/awk/outline_classic11.awk.txt]
** Change to numbered format (1, 1.1, 1.1.1 ...) - [http://www.pement.org/awk/outline_numbered11.awk.txt]
* emacs131.zip - Make Multi-Edit for Windows emulate the keybindings for Emacs;
this file works for ME version 7.11 and 8, but it's not optimized for Multi-Edit 9.+ yet. I was working on it, so if you're curious, email me. - visit 
http://www.pement.org/develop/ and scroll down.
* emacs_key.zip - keymap redefinition file to make PFE (Programmer's File Editor) emulate the keybindings of GNU Emacs, as much as possible - visit
http://www.pement.org/develop/ and scroll down

the other day.  It is not very sophisticated, but somebody ;) could
expand it... -- AlexSchroeder

: I read some of your Awk scripts not too long ago, and just came upon your "Emacs Tabs"
document, and discovered it was authored by the same character.  Keep on hacking.  --AaronHawley
