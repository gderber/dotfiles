Yet Another Emacs Junkie.  You can email me at <joelh@gnu.org>.

Here's my .emacs.el, for the interested.  I've been randomly extending
it for a decade now (but regrettably lost my CVS server so only have
logs back to 2000).  The file presently is now a hefty 92k; it's
gotten quite a lot of cruft.  But in the interest of letting other
people use the same cruft, I'll post it here.

This is mostly for giving people ideas.  If you intend to actually use
something out of this, then you may want to email me.  I don't update
this page often, and I may have improved on whatever you're copying.

I use Emacs.  More specifically, I exclusively use GNU Emacs.  I have
no idea if this works with XEmacs or not.

[removed out-of-date and broken version of my .emacs; I'll post a fresh one soon.]
