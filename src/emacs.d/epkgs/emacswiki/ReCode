`recode' is a program that allows you to change the encodings of files.  

Most of the time Emacs can do this for you.  
For example, to convert a file encoded with latin-1 in the utf-8 encoding,
open the file with emacs, specifying the latin-1 encoding:

  C-x RET c latin-1 RET C-x C-f file-name

Then use 

  M-x set-buffer-file-coding-system

and specify utf-8 that time as the real coding system. You can now save and the file will be recorded
using the utf-8 encoding.

There is another way to recode the file from latin-1 to utf-8, assuming
that utf-8 is your default system encoding. Load the file in utf-8 format 
and use

  C-x h M-x recode-region

specifying this time latin-1. The resulting buffer will be in utf-8 format.


Sometimes, however, recode comes handy.

You might want to convert a unicode file to an ASCII HTML file with
HTML entities, for example, when you want to paste some text you have
written in Emacs into a field that cannot be encoded using the charset
of the website you are visiting. This can happen, for example, when
you want to paste some non-Latin-1 onto a wiki with a Latin-1 charset.

Here's how:

 recode utf8..html file.txt

`iconv' is often present
by default on a system and does a similar job to recode.

On a file written on Mac OS X, I found that umlauts were translated
correctly -- with one exception: The German sharp S, `ÃŸ', is not
translated correctly, it seems. Furthermore, the file continued to be
full of `^M' characters. I assume that both `^M' and `^M^J' are used
-- `^M' for newlines within a paragraph and `^M^J' for newlines
separating paragraphs. -- AlexSchroeder (please update this info and
