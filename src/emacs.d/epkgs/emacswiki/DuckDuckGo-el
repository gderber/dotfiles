[http://duckduckgo.com DuckDuckGo] is a web search engine with an [http://api.duckduckgo.com easy API].

Lisp:ddg.el is the EmacsLisp API for "The Instant Answer API" for searching and retrieving this kind of results from !DuckDuckGo:

* Topic Summaries
* Categories
* Disambiguation
* [https://api.duckduckgo.com/bang.html !bang redirects] (like <code>!imdb</code>, <code>!safeoff</code>, <code>!ddg</code>, etc.)
* Definitions
* Using [https://duckduckgo.com/goodies goodies]


== Usage ==

Lisp:ddg.el just have two main functions: 

* `(ddg-search TERM)' -- Search for a term synchronously.
* `(ddg-search-asyn TERM FUNCTION)' -- Search for a term asynchronously. 

In the asynchronous case when the request has finished, ddg will call the function passed as parameter `FUNCTION' with the result as a parameter. The result will be a JSON parsed list(take a look at the `json-read' function at the [[JSON]] package).

Example:

    (defun myfunc (res)
      (setq results res)
      ;; ...
      ;; ...
      )
    (ddg-search-asyn "site:emacswiki duckduckgo-el" 'myfunc)

When I was writing this I thought that the API presented at http://api.duckduckgo.com could be used for searching strings on the web, like if you use the textbox in the page... but no, it implemets other caracteristics. I'll update this page now! -- ChristianGim√©nez
