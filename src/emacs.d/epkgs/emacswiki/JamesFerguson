Below is some info on email within emacs.  I gave this up, but I'll leave it around in case there is something useful in there.

=Gnus for IMAP Email with Offlineimap and Dovecot=

This is a scratchpad, to which I intend to add information and then perhaps promote it out of my personal page:

I decided to try to use offlineIMAP/Dovecot/Gnus for email.  Gnus is synchronous so it can tie up emacs, so a good solution is to use offlineimap to get the mail, and then use a local IMAP server like Dovecot to access it (gnus has some problems reading the maildir output itself).

It's essential to study the internal manual, particularly the "Mail in a Newsreader" section.

===offlineIMAP===
Installing offlineIMAP and configuring it is pretty straightforward and well documented.  I'm currently running it in a screen session, though it could just run in emacs.

===dovecot===
This doesn't even have to run as a server - gnus can run it as a shell command directly.  See config below

===gnus===

~/.gnus:
<pre>
(setq gnus-select-method '(nnimap "Mail" (nnimap-stream shell)))
(setq imap-shell-program "/usr/sbin/dovecot --exec-mail imap")
</pre>

Working out what to do after M-x gnus is pretty bewildering until you trawl through a /lot/ of doc.  Some of the important keys I found:

In the groups (folders) view:

||L||List all groups, including unread||
||l||List only groups with unread||
||g||get new messages - refresh||
||A A||List all groups||
||^||go to a server view, then you can select your Mail server and get at the groups another way.  Sometimes this is the only way I can see a new folder.  Still working this out.||

In the group/folder view

||#||mark message.  M-# unmarks, then commands can be done on multiple marked messages||
||M-u||clear all marks - ticks, read, old etc||
||M-g||refresh.  With prefix arg., will also show previously read messages||
||R||Reply||
||F||Follow-up (reply all)||
||K H||send HTML message to display in browser||
||K b||create buttons for all mime parts||
||C-c C-s||Prefix for sort commands - C-h will show them all||

There's no way around it though, you have to spend an hour or two reading the manual (and then revisiting it...).
