This page describe how to configure Lisp:gnus-autocheck.el in order to have Gnus check for new incoming news and mails automatically

==Configuration==
It's very easy, all you have to do is to load the library and to call M-x customize-group gnus-autocheck

You can also configure it directly in your .gnus.el file using the following:
<pre>
(require 'gnus-autocheck)

;; automatic check every 2 minutes for new incoming mails by night
(setq gnus-autocheck-interval (* 60 2))

;; autocheck should run all saturday and sunday
(setq gnus-autocheck-active-days '("Sat" "Sun"))

;; autocheck should run all saturday and sunday
(setq gnus-autocheck-active-days '("Sat" "Sun"))

;; autocheck should not run between 8:30AM and 6PM during work days
(setq gnus-autocheck-active-periods '(("00:00" "08:30") ("18:00" "23:59")))
</pre>

You can also declare a function to be called before actually checking for news. This can be useful if you need a third party program to feed your news/emails server.
This can be achieved this way:
<pre>
(add-hook 'gnus-autocheck-hook 'func-to-call-before-checking-for-news)
</pre>
