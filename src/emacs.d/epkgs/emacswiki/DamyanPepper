I use Emacs, and have been using it for a little over 10 years now, but have only in the last year or two started to get really interested in using it for things beyond editing source code.  I'm starting to see what I can do with elisp, and am having a great time with it!

Emacs things I use daily at work:

* PlannerMode
* JabberEl
* ViewMail
* CPlusPlusMode
* EmacsTags
* PerforceSCM
* http://users.skynet.be/ppareit/projects/graphviz-dot-mode/graphviz-dot-mode.html

Things I play with at home:

* SlimeMode
* EmacsIRCClient

Things I've written:

* AutoSmiley
