ClojureMode is a major mode that provides font-lock, indentation, and functions for communication with subprocesses for [http://clojure.org Clojure].

It's more useful if used together with [[nREPL.el]] to interact with subprocesses. See [http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/emacs.html this guide] for details on setting up Emacs for Clojure development.
