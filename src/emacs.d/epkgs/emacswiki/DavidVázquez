Hi, my name is David. I'm a student of mathematics from Spain. You can reach me as [::davazp] on #emacs and #emacs-es irc channels.

I'm a free software user. I love emacs and lisp, and the emacs modes which I usually use are:
* c-mode, scheme-mode, octave-mode, gdba, etc...(programming)
* SlimeMode and ParEdit (lisp programming)
* [[Gnus]]
* [[ERC]] (I wrote [[ErcTex]], a simple hack to render TeX formulas in ERC buffers)
* AdvancedDeskCalculator
* imaxima-imath
* DiredMode
* AUCTeX
* TrampMode
* BbdbMode
* [[emacs-w3m]]
* OrgMode (with RememberMode)

I use Emacs

Welcome to the wiki! :) I really appreciate the Spanish translations. We need more translators. Thanks. The little translation links are explained on TranslatingPages, I hope. -- AlexSchroeder
