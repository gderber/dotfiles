Extended search doesn't trim input.

If you enter a username as "MichaelPaulukonis " and hit enter, you'll get the corresponding URL <code>http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs?action=rc&match=&rcfilteronly=&rcuseronly=MichaelPaulukonis+&rchostonly=&followup=&lang=&dofilter=Go!</code> Where the ''space'' has been converted to a ''plus-sign''.

Why would you enter something stupid like a space at the end of an input?

Maybe you cut-n-pasted some text, and the trailing space came along for an invisible ride.

Maybe this would be better posed on [[Problems]]. It's not the biggest issue in the Emacs world.
