When editing a page or running maintenance, the wiki will create locks.
If it then crashes due to a bug, the lock will be left behind.
The symptoms are:

# Delays of about five seconds when loading pages
# An error when trying to save a file claiming that the main lock could not be removed

How to proceed:

# Check how old the lock is.  It /could/ be maintenance taking a few minutes only.
  You can see the lock directories here: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/temp/
# Check what processes are running.
  You'll find them here: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/pids/
# Remove the locks:
  Follow the _Administration_ link at the bottom of the page and click on _Unlock the wiki_.
  That will take you here: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs?action=unlock
