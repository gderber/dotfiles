Welcome to the wiki. -- DrewAdams

thanks, what are the timestamps for?

Nothing special.  Sometimes they can help you understand old contributions to a page better, by knowing how old they are.  If you use %%[new]%% instead of %%[new<two colons>]%% then you don't get a timestamp. -- DrewAdams

Ok, thanks. I've been a bit restricted due to problems with the left hand. Sad. I'd like to do so many things. I got hooked more and more with Emacs and Lisp just before I started get that issues...
