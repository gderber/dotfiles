Here's what I got from a /CTCP VERSION command sent to #emacs...  The winner is: *IRSSI*!

 35 irssi-0.8
 30 ERC 5.0
 20 xchat 2.4
  6 rcirc
  6 ?
  3 xchat 2.6
  3 ircII
  3 Circe
  2 Colloquy 2.0.1 (2D32)
  2 BitchX
  1 rcirc.el 0.9
  1 mIRC 5.91

IRC is InternetRelayChat for those of you who don't know.  Chat networks instead of single servers.

Note that four different Emacs based clients are represented: ERC, Circe, rcirc and riece.

And note that ZenIRC, the granddaddy of Emacs IRC clients, isn't represented at all! I have to admit, I'm somewhat surprised. I guess iNoah wasn't in the channel that day. -- EdwardOConnor
