=MH-E=

My MUA, nmh (with [[MH-E]] interface to my GnuEmacs)) absolutely
R'''0x'''x0r''zz''z because it follows the UnixWay, yours propably
su''xxx''0rZ, except if it's [[MH-E]] too.  Well, if you run your
sucky GNUS, ViewMail or whatnot under Emacs, which also doesn't follow
the UnixWay, then it's okay to not follow it, because Emacs doesn't
either.  With [[MH-E]] i'm not bound to Emacs, which i don't want to
b3.  It also shows the X-Face -header, which is propably the most
important feature of any mail-systems anyway!  Thus

    (setq mail-user-agent "mh-e-user-agent")
    (setq read-mail-command "mh-rmail")

<code>setq</code> man, <code>setq</code> is b0nd!!1!! <code>(._.-' ( (O) ) '-._.)</code>

=GNUS=

Hey [[tekonivel]], don't be so daft.  I use my GNUS to read my mail.  It's
perfect for me, i can even send hotmail and internetmessengers to my
friends in our local stamp-collection club with it.

Yours, Dwayne Dibbly


=Wanderlust=

Hey guys, WanderLust is much more
saner. All mail clients sucks but this one sucks less.

Your LdBeth.
