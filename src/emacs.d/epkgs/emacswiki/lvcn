I rolled back your edits of general, English pages such as CategoryDirectories, CategoryCommands, CategoryHypermedia, and KeyboardMacros. Please do not change the language of a page.  Instead, create a new, translated page in your language (e.g. Chinese).  See this page for info: HowLanguagesWork.  To save time when creating the new pages, you can use your previous edits - they are available by clicking `History' for the pages I rolled back.  Thanks -- DrewAdams

ok, Thanks a lot!

If only I knew the page names in Chinese then I could fix it... :)

* I moved the Chinese copy of Org-Mode to [[Org-Mode (中文)]]. Perhaps there is a better page name for it, however.
* I added a Chinese translation link to CategoryVersionControl pointing to [[版本控制]]. I hope that is correct.

If you can tell Chinese translations of pages you're interested in translating, I can set things up for you. I'd be very happy to!
