This module changes the look of Buffers list and Buffer menu.

* A *new modification status* meaning "modified and saved". Makes it possible to distinguish files that have never been changed from files that have been changed and saved.
* *Colorization* of meta data columns (status, size, mode). A special face can be used for the unsaved indicator ("*") for real files (buffers connected to files).
* *Compaction* of size and mode, when needed. (E.g. changes size indication from "12345" to "12k" if the buffer name is long.)
* *Compaction* of file path, when possible. Show home directory path as "~/".
* *Character syntax* for "." and some other chars changed to *symbol*, to simplify selection of a complete file name.

The new modification status appears in both the Buffers list and in
the Buffers menu. The other enhancements are only for the Buffers list.

Note. This module does *not* work with Emacs-22 or later, nor with XEmacs.

* Lisp:fix-buffers-list.el

Other Buffers Menu enhancements can be found in the BufferMenu page.
