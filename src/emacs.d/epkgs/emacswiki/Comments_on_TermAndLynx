Hello
With now doubt that Lynx&Emacs bundle might be convenient in many cases. For example it is handy to accumulate text out from browser into Emacs buffer or register. But there are few obstacles there:

 - Emacs frame with Lynx don't know about:
   - C-x SPC or C-x @ to mark necessary region;
   - M-x. Hence it is not possible to accumulate.

Does anybody know about available solution?
Thank you.
Anton
