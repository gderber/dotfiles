EmacsWikiBlog is a little package that works with EmacsWikiMode to help you keep a weblog with entries per day.

This package was created and is mantained by [http://www.sfu.ca/~gswamina/ Ganesh Swami].

== Downloading ==

The package is in [http://www.sfu.ca/~gswamina/ Ganesh Swami], you can download it here [http://www.sfu.ca/~gswamina/code/emacs-wiki-blog.el emacs-wiki-blog.el].

== Installing ==

To install and use EmacsWikiBlog you have to install and configure the EmacsWikiMode first.

Then add these lines to your InitFile:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/emacs-wiki-blog.el)

After this you are ready to blog.

== Configuring ==

To make your blog visible, you have to add these lines in one of your file to publish ie.: WelcomePage

  <lisp>
    (emacs-wiki-blog-last-n-entries 5) 
    (emacs-wiki-blog-generate-archives)
  </lisp>

This will publish your last 5 entries and and will create your files to publish with suffix .html or whatever extension you have configured/defaulted to in EmacsWikiMode

== Creating Entries ==

Well, this is the funny part so pay more attention here:

To create an entry you have to create a file in this format "YYYY.MM.DD". This is the format that EmacsWikiBlog reads; you have to put this file in your emacs-wiki-page-file. This can be done by typing: `M-x emacs-wiki-find-file YYYY.MM.DD`

After finishing your entry you have to save the buffer (`C-x C-s`); then go to the WelcomePage buffer (or wherever you will put your blog) and type: `M-x emacs-wiki-refresh-buffers`; this will write your new entry to the buffer.

*Note* : Maybe the people from the EmacsWikiMode can create a shortcut for emacs-wiki-refresh-buffers, we will not have to write `M-x emacs-wiki-refresh-buffers`

Done!! you have a blog with Emacs using EmacsWikiMode and EmacsWikiBlog.

== Some Features ==

You can generate a calendar with the function: emacs-wiki-blog-generate-calendar, this will create a calendar and create a link in every day when a new entry was created:

  (emacs-wiki-blog-generate-calendar nil 1)

Will create a calendar with the current month and with Monday as the first day of the week
