==Overview==

Protect against clobbering user-writable files.

==Quickstart==

	(require 'hardhat)
 
	(global-hardhat-mode 1)
 
	;; now you are protected from editing:
	;;
	;;     .git/index
	;;     ~/.emacs.d/elpa/hardhat-0.1.0/hardhat.el
	;;     ~/.emacs~
	;;
	;; and many others


==Explanation==

A recent unwholesome trend is for package managers to install files
in locations such as "~/.cabal", "~/.rvm", or "~/.emacs.d/elpa".
It is rarely meant for such files to be edited; doing so can cause
data loss in some circumstances.

In addition, many user-writable files created in the course of
ordinary work should never be altered by a text editor, /eg/ the
database stored in a ".git" directory.

Hardhat.el provides an extra layer of protection in your work.  If
you visit a file which looks unsafe to edit, Emacs will make the
buffer read-only -- even when the underlying file is writable.

The read-only protection can be turned off for a buffer by the
usual methods, or by toggling off buffer-local hardhat-mode via
the lighter menu or

	M-x hardhat-mode RET

If a buffer is not visiting a file, hardhat-mode has no effect.
If the visited file is not writable by the user, hardhat-mode
has no effect.

To use hardhat, place the hardhat.el library somewhere
Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

	(require 'hardhat)
	(global-hardhat-mode 1)

To inquire as to why hardhat has set or unset protection in
a buffer, the following interactive command is provided

	hardhat-status

but not bound to any key.

==See Also==

M-x customize-group RET hardhat RET

==Notes==

Hardhat-mode takes no action until the user attempts an
interactive command in a buffer.  This is for compatibility:
an Emacs Lisp library may freely open and write to a file
protected by hardhat-mode, so long as it is done programatically.

For any of the options settable in customize, rules making
buffers "editable" override rules making buffers "protected".

A Boolean file-local variable `hardhat-protect' is provided.
When `hardhat-protect' is set, no other rules are consulted.

Regular-expression matches are case-insensitive.  A case-
sensitive test can be implemented by adding custom function
to eg `hardhat-buffer-protected-functions'.

==Compatibility and Requirements==

	GNU Emacs version 24.3-devel     : yes, at the time of writing
	GNU Emacs version 24.1 & 24.2    : yes
	GNU Emacs version 23.3           : yes
	GNU Emacs version 22.3 and lower : no

==Bugs==

This is alpha-quality software; bugs are expected.

More exceptions are certainly needed in `hardhat-fullpath-editable-regexps'.

==Availability==

hardhat.el is available at github:
