*Follow Mode* make side-by-side windows behave like a tall virtual window, written by [[AndersLindgren|Anders Lindgren]]. This package is bundled with Emacs.

== Basics ==

You can start Follow mode and setting up a basic two-window layout using ##M-x follow-delete-other-windows-and-split RET##.

When you move one window, the other(s) follow (hence the name "Follow Mode"). If you move the point outside the window, it will move to the adjacent window (if it shows the same buffer).
