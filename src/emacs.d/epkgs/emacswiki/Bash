bash use readline and share many keybindings with emacs for instance:

* C-a C-e: goto start/end of line
* C-k: kill line
* C-y M-y: insert the last stretch of killed text
* C-_ : undo
and more see man bash

Some other bindings differ a bit:

* C-r C-s : incremental search in the history, not on the line
* M-space to set the mark (though C-@ is defined)
Some commands are not bound by default, here what I do to add kill-region and kill-ring-save:

in my .bashrc:
<pre>
# this supposed that GNU stty is installed and that the special chars are the same on your terminal as on mine
# undef C-s and C-r  I don't like C-s to stop my terminal, and find it more usefull for incremental search
stty stop undef 
stty rprnt undef
#undef C-w , readline automagically binds the special terminal chars to their equivalent commands
stty werase undef
</pre>

and in my .inputrc:
<pre>
#C-w kill-region
"\C-w":kill-region
#M-w roughly the same as kill-ring-save
"\M-w":copy-region-as-kill
# C-space to set-mark
"\C-Space":set-mark
</pre>


=== Notes:===

Credits goes to the guys on #bash on irc.freenode for telling me about stty and special chars. See man and info pages for bash and readline for more info.

I am no terminal/readline... specialist so correction comments etc.. are welcome.

On Windows, later versions of bash (3.2.3) choke on scripts created with the NT-emacs default encoding, because of the ^M characters.  Try adding this to your .emacs:
{{{
(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
}}}
