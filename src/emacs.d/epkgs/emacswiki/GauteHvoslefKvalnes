I use Emacs, mostly CarbonEmacs on a Powerbook. It's a quite
up-to-date version based on Emacs 22 from CVS. Emacs is the environment I use for text editing, CommonLisp programming (with
[[SlimeMode|SLIME]]), and [[Gnus]], of course.

== po-mode+ ==

I work on translating KDE and OpenOffice.org into Norwegian
Nynorsk. For years, I've translated in [http://kbabel.kde.org/
KBabel], but since hacking C++ is boring and hacking Lisp is fun, I
cast my eyes on [http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/ GNU Gettext]'s
PoMode. I improved it to include some essential features of KBabel.

This is my first time doing EmacsLisp stuff beyond the simplest
macros. The existing PoMode code, the EmacsLispManual, and random
browsing on EmacsWiki have all proved useful. (If I've picked up
bad habits, I'd appreciate any warnings :-)) The way some of
DrewsElispLibraries are made as ''extensions'' seems neat to me, since
they avoid modifying the original library. Inspired by those, I turned
my PoMode hacks into [[po-mode+.el]] before posting them here.

Have you considered submitting your changes to the po-mode maintainer? -- EdwardOConnor

I will propose my changes, but I'll hack around some more first. I don't think it's quite ready yet, and I've still got more features to add. -- GauteHvoslefKvalnes

== Catman ==

I plan to write a catalog manager, similar to the one in KBabel. (It's 
tempting to name it ''Catman''.) A catalog manager makes working on
large translation projects a lot easier. I've done a basic mockup that
analyzes the files in one folder and displays statistics for them, but
I need to rethink the structure before posting anything. It makes
sense to keep this mode separate from PoMode. Since the files will be
opened normally, Emacs will load PoMode anyway. (Unless the
translator has chosen differently, which he should be free to do.)
