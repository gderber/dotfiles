This page is about using [[http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin]] with Emacs. Cygwin is a collection of tools that provide UNIX functionality on Microsoft Windows.  There are two different ways Emacs and Cygwin can be combined: (1) run Cygwin shells within Emacs or (2) run Emacs within Cygwin. 


== Running Cygwin as an inferior shell in Emacs ==

* NTEmacsWithCygwin -- how to use Cygwin shells with Emacs, and why you might want to
* <tt>[[setup-cygwin.el]]</tt> -- set up Emacs for using Cygwin.  From Markus Hoenika's paper "SGML for Windows NT" <hoenika_markus@compuserve.com>
* <tt>[[cygwin-mount.el]]</tt> -- use Cygwin-style filenames such as  ##//D/any/path/to/file## or ##/cygdrive/D/any/path/to/file## the same way you use MS Windows-style filenames
* HomeConfusion -- setting ##$HOME## when you have Cygwin installed as well as Emacs
* SetTty -- why you should set ##CYGWIN="tty"##



== Running Emacs from within Cygwin ==

* CustomizingBoth -- making your InitFile work with both non- and cygwinized emacsen
* CygwinizedEmacsHOWTO -- how to get started with a Cygwinized (GNU) emacs
* CygwinizedEmacsEvaluated -- performance and size compared to NTEmacs
* CygwinizedEmacsWithWindowsPath -- make Cygwinized Emacs understand Windows style path
* <tt>[[windows-path.el]]</tt> -- use windows-style filenames like ##c:/path/file## or ##c:\path\file## in Cygwin Emacs
