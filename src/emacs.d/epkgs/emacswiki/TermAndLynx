To browse the web from within an Emacs window, using a fully-functional and long-established web browser, this is one solution:

Open up a new ANSI terminal window: <code>M-x ansi-term</code> followed by RETURN

At the prompt "Run program:", instead of the default <tt>/bin/sh</tt>, enter <code>lynx</code> instead. Of course, this presumes that Lynx runs correctly from the command line normally.

Voila! You have the benefits of the Lynx web browser, running within an Emacs buffer.
