You have figured out how to get and even send E-mail with Gnus under Windows.

Yet, when you

* click on a mailto link in your favorite web browser
* enter a mailto link via Start->Run->%%mailto:someone@somewhere%%
* use Start->E-mail

you find yourself in Outlook or, as some corporate users will have to
admit, even Lotus Notes.

Well, that was enough motivation for me yesterday to see what I could
do about that.

My solution involves adding follwing !MsWindowsRegistry settings:

*Warning*

Make a backup of your ~/.emacs before you experiment with this feature.

Be sure to have an XEmacs already running, since gnuclient expressions
are currently processed too early in a newly started XEmacs, before
initialization is complete.

All of this is experimental and works fine with the !InnoSetup
gnuclient kits available from
http://www.xemacs.org/Download/win32/#InnoSetup-Gnuclient-Download
when XEmacs is already running.

MsWindowsXEmacsGnusRegistrySettings

Save the above to a file with the .reg extension.

Double-click on it in Explorer or use regedit->File->Import...

You'll get a popup like this:

[[image:ImportXEmacsGnusRegistry]]

And another to the effect that the import was successful.

Now open Start->Control Panel->Internet Options

[[image:MsWindowsControlPanelInternetOptions]]

Pick the XEmacs Gnus E-mail menu entry in the Programs tab and click OK.

Now try a mailto link, e.g. by entering one in Start->Run...->Open: %%mailto:someone@somewhere%%

[[image:MsWindowsStartRunOpenMailto]]

A running XEmacs will get sent the lisp expression to compose a mail to someone@somewhere in Gnus, e.g.
