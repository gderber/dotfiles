Hey guy,

Thanks a lot.

> However, it would be good if, once loaded, fci-mode was enabled by default for most text and programming modes and disabled for special buffers (like *Messages*, *Buffer List*, *Completions*, etc)

You can do something like this:

(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'fci-mode)

As most of programming modes inherited from prog-mode you can got what you want.

I installed it using List-package in emacs 24 , after that if I add (require 'fill-column-indicator) in my .emacs I am getting an error , although I can toggle fci-mode with M-x key . and I am not able to enforce it globally . Please can someone point me to right direction .
