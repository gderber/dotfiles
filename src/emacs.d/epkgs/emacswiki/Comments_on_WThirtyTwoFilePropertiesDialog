May I kindly suggest anyone from EmacsWiki most frequent updaters/reviewers to please try to contact back LynX to possibly know where else FilePropertiesDialog.zip can be downloaded from ?
It seems that nice feature provided by this tool is unavailable elsewhere... ;-) and I'm quite sure more people may need it too.
Thanks in advance for your comprehension and help
Best Regards
