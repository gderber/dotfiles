The Unix or GNU/Linux `apropos' command is similar to AproposMode, but it shows a list
of Unix or GNU/Linux manual (`man') pages (see ManMode) matching the search instead of functions and variables. Library
##sys-apropos.el## is a simple Emacs interface for this command.

In the 2002 version <code>sys-apropos-line-regexp</code> is a bit too tight and you may find some pages not displayed, including Perl modules, pages with "." dots, and alphanumeric sections like "(3ncurses)".  Here's a more relaxed setting which should catch everything

    (setq sys-apropos-line-regexp
      "^\\([^ \t]+?\\)[ \t]*(\\([0-9].*?\\))[ \t-]+\\(.*\\)")

See also ManMode where "<code>M-x man -k pattern</code>" does a similar apropos run and display.
