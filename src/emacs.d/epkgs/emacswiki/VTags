VTags is project that lets [x]emacs 
use the same (sorted) [[TagsFile]]s that Vim uses. It does not read the file into a 
buffer but rather does a binary search of the file on disk. Thus it is fast and 
uses less RAM than `etags' (see EmacsTags). It is quite usable, but does not have all of the features 
available with either of the current etags.el implementations. Frankly, some of the 
features of etags.el are pretty obscure and/or don't make sense in the context of 
vim-style tags files. 
See https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/vtags.

By using Vim [[TagsFile]]s, VTags provides the following Vim feature: When a tag has
multiple entries in the tag file, Vim makes a list of the files the 
tag appears in -- then you can choose one by selecting a number.  You can thus search trees where there are multiple files that implement the same functions
for porting reasons.  

These libraries also let you choose among multiple tags for the same name:

* [[Icicles - Emacs Tags Enhancements]]
* EtagsSelect
