FrankSchmitt started a thread on emacs-devel called "May I publish a Windows Installer for GNU Emacs?"  I always thought installation of Emacs on Windows to be trivial.  Just unpack the archive, start addpm.exe, start Emacs.  Works. -- AlexSchroeder

Even though it is extremely easy to install Emacs it might have been cool to have a setup-program which:

* optionally downloaded the latest version from ftp.gnu.org
* created a HOME directory and environment variable
* installed a basic .emacs file, maybe the user could choose among a couple of different ones:
** for coding purposes
** for other purposes
** etc...
* runs addpm.exe (or optionally does what it already does, eneter registry data and adding start menu item)
* there is a project where you can install a .emacs file that asks the user if he wants to do X or Y, maybe the same questions could be incorporated in a installation program?

Or whatever... :)
