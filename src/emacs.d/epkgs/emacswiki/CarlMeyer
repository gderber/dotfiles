I use Emacs, though I'm pretty much an EmacsNewbie - just started
using it a few weeks ago.  Prior to that I was a devoted JoeEditor
user - still use joe for minor sysadmin tasks, but I'll never use it
again for writing code or anything else.

My first contribution to EmacsWiki is EasyCodeOutline - one of my
favorite Emacs tricks so far.

Things I would like to do with Emacs that I haven't figured out how to
do yet:
 
* add little buttons to the leftbar in OutlineMode to allow
mouse-navigation of an outline (I've found something called
outl-mouse.el floating around, but it seems to be written for XEmacs -
at least it requires make-glyph which isn't on my install) 

: I think that not using mouse is a victory, I wonder why you need it :) --

I figured someone would come along and say that :-) See, it's more to do with
showing friends who are stuck on their favorite proprietary IDE that Emacs can
do anything worthwhile that <insert IDE here> can do.

Sometimes I lurk on #emacs as carljm.
