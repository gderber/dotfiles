Send a CTCP VERSION to all of #emacs. This is potentially rude, so don't do this lightly.

Actually, you now need to do this manually for every single nick in the channel as simply sending the request to the channel will give you an error: "Cannot send to nick/channel".

Place point at the beginning of the output and invoke `M-x irc-version-summary' defined as follows:

{{{
(defun irc-version-summary ()
  "Run this after you've sent a /CTCP #test VERSION."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (let ((agents))
      (while (re-search-forward "CTCP VERSION \\([a-z]\\([^- \n:/]+\\|[^- \n:/]*[-/][^- \n:/0-9]+\\)\\)?" nil t)
	(let* ((word (or (match-string-no-properties 1) "unknown"))
	       (key (replace-regexp-in-string "-" ""
		       (downcase word)))
	       (cell (or (assoc key agents)
			 (car (setq agents (cons (cons key 0) agents))))))
	  (setcdr cell (1+ (cdr cell)))))
      (setq agents (sort agents (lambda (a b) (> (cdr a) (cdr b)))))
      (pop-to-buffer (get-buffer-create "*IRC Clients*"))
      (erase-buffer)
      (dolist (item agents)
	(insert (format "%4d %s\n" (cdr item) (car item))))
      (insert "----\n"
	      (format "%4d total\n"
		      (apply '+ (mapcar 'cdr agents)))))))
}}}
