This page gives an overview of Emacs jargon. See CategoryGlossary for more.

Here is a translation to/from Emacs-speak:

In Emacs terms:

* A '''[[frame]]''' is a window-manager "window".
* A '''[[window]]''' is a [[frame]] ''pane'', that is, a subframe.
* The '''[[mode line]]''' is the text at the bottom border of a [[window]].
* A '''[[buffer]]''' contains Emacs objects such as text. A given [[buffer]] might or might not be displayed in some [[window]].
* The '''[[minibuffer]]''' is the special [[buffer]] for entering [[command]]s; it
appears either in a separate [[frame]] by itself or at the
bottom of each [[frame]].
* The '''[[cursor]]''' shows where you insert typed text. By default, the cursor is rectangular, but you can change that.
* The '''[[pointer]]''' shows the mouse position. By default, it is an arrow, but you can change that.
* The position of the cursor at any time is called '''[[point]]'''. For example, if the cursor is on the third character in a buffer, then point = 3. See [[region]] for more about [[point]].
* Mouse buttons are called '''`mouse-1'''', '''`mouse-2'''', and '''`mouse-3'''' (left to right, usually). Outside of Emacs, these are sometimes written "MB1", "MB2", and "MB3".
* A '''[[key binding]]''' is a mapping (relation) between an Emacs [[command]] and a [[key sequence]]. The same [[command]] can be bound to more than one [[key sequence]]. A given [[key sequence]] is the binding of at most one [[command]] in any given context (e.g. any given [[buffer]]). The same [[key sequence]] can be bound to different [[command]]s in different contexts and different [[keymap]]s.
* A '''[[keymap]]''' is a collection of [[key binding]]s, so it is a mapping (relation) between Emacs [[command]]s and [[key sequence]]s. A [[keymap]] can be global, local, or applicable only to a [[minor mode]].


'''Note:''' Menu items and mouse actions are also referred to as '''[[key sequence]]s'''. If you are prompted for a [[key sequence]], you can usually point to a menu item or perform a mouse action (e.g. click `mouse-1')
instead of using keyboard keys.




=== Emacs-Speak Exercise ===

If you can follow this exercise, then you understand Emacs-speak. If you understand all of the actions described, then you pretty much understand how to use Emacs. Good luck :D !

# I saved [[buffer]] <code>foobar</code> to its file using '''[[key sequence]]''' `C-x C-s', which is '''bound''' to [[command]] `save-buffer'.
# Having forgotten the '''[[key binding]]''' and the complete name for [[command]] `split-window-horizontally', I used [[key sequence]] `M-x' (by pressing the Alt key while typing <code>x</code>). Then I typed <code>s p l i t - w i n</code>. My input appeared in the '''[[minibuffer]]''': <code>split-win</code>. 
# I hit the `TAB' key, and the [[minibuffer]] input was partially '''completed''' to <code>split-window</code>, meaning that there is a [[command]] whose name begins with "<code>split-window</code>".
# I hit the `TAB' key again, and a [[minibuffer]] message next to my echoed input said "<code>[Complete, but not unique]</code>", telling me that "<code>split-window</code>" is the complete name of a [[command]], but also that there are other [[command]]s whose names begin with "<code>split-window</code>".
# I hit the `TAB' key again. This opened a new '''[[window]]''' in the same '''[[frame]]''', displaying the `*Completions*' [[buffer]], which showed several [[command]] names beginning with "<code>split-window</code>". I clicked the [[command]] name <code>split-window-horizontally</code>, using `mouse-2'. 
# The `*Completions*' [[buffer]] (and its [[window]]) disappeared, and the [[frame]] was divided into two [[window]]s, side by side -- they each displayed [[buffer]] `foobar'. This was the result of executing [[command]] `split-window-horizontally' in the [[window]] of [[buffer]] `foobar'.
# Next, I split the left [[window]], using [[command]] `split-window-vertically' -- or, rather, I used its [[key binding]], which is [[key sequence]] `C-x 2' (which I happened to remember). At this point, the [[frame]] had three [[window]]s, each containing [[buffer]] `foobar': I could see the name "<code>foobar</code>" in the '''[[mode line]]''' of each [[window]].
# I clicked `mouse-1' in the top left [[window]], to put the '''[[cursor]]''' -- and the focus of attention -- there.  Then I visited file `toto' there, by using [[key sequence]] `C-x C-f' (which is bound to [[command]] `find-file'). I could tell by the name in the [[window]]'s [[mode line]] that its [[buffer]] was now `toto'. I dragged the [[mode line]] using `mouse-1', to resize [[buffer]] `toto's [[window]] in its [[frame]].
# In [[buffer]] `toto', I dragged `mouse-1' over some text, to select that text as the active '''[[region]]'''. I used [[key sequence]] `C-w' to '''kill''' the [[region]]'s text.
# I clicked `mouse-1' in [[buffer]] `foobar'. This moved the [[cursor]] to where the '''[[pointer]]''' was when I clicked. I then '''yanked''' the text that I had killed from [[buffer]] `toto' to '''[[point]]''' (cursor position) in [[buffer]] `foobar'.

'''Exercise:''' Say the example backwards, in common (non-Emacs) terms, in ''Norwegian''.
