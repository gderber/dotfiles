Hacker errant and bumbling cyberneticist. I go by [::technomancy] on IRC.

I created my own ergonomic mechanical keyboard to use with Emacs: https://atreus.technomancy.us

I've written a few fun modes:

* [[FindFileInProject]]
* [[IdleHighlight]]
* [https://p.hagelb.org/ scpaste]
* [https://github.com/technomancy/better-defaults better-defaults]

I've contributed to some others:

* [https://github.com/technomancy/clojure-mode Clojure Mode] and [https://github.com/sanel/monroe monroe]
* [[Rudel]] for collaborative editing.
* [http://bit.ly/pkg-el package.el], a package manager.
* ErtTestLibrary for automated testing.
* [[Magit]] for working with Git repositories.
* EmacsRi for reading Ruby documentation

Deprecated:

* [https://github.com/technomancy/conspire Conspire], a system for collaborative editing.
* Rinari, a mode for RubyOnRails (now maintained by Eric Schulte)
* [https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit the Starter Kit], a set of better defaults and bundled libraries.

Hi!
After seeing some git+eshell snippet on your github page, I was wondering: do you use git under eshell sucessfully?
It worked for me on Windows, but on Linux it just said "NOT A REAL TERMINAL" when I tried `git log' and others.
(sorry for messing around - could not find your email)
--hsu

hsu: you have to set your PAGER environment variable to "cat"; then it works great. (setenv "PAGER" "cat") But instead of using git log in the shell, I'd recommend using magit instead; it's much nicer.
