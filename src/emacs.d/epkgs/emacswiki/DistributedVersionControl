If you are building from bzr, be aware of one gotcha: if the first ##emacs## executable in your ##$PATH## is a symlink, then the directory containing that symlink will be used as the base install location by ##make install##. Fix: either change ##$PATH## to expose the actual installed ##emacs## binary first, at least for the duration of the configure/make/install procedure, or hand-edit the ##Makefile## created by running ##./configure## to install to the correct location.
