Is there a way to make directory locals apply to files matching a pattern? I want to apply a mode to all files in a certain directory based on a file extension that emacs doesn’t (and shouldn’t) recognize by default. How do I do this without using `(eval)` or editing my `.emacs`? This should be doable in a project-specific way…
