Is it possible to use the mouse when using Emacs via PuTTY?

There is a very good article on this at Google Code, under EmacsSSH. But I found it by just typing your question into Google.

Add this to the destination's .emacs:

(xterm-mouse-mode t)

I can select a new cursor position, or select a region, and I guess just about anything.  (I don't do much with images, so I've only used it on emacs text.)  (Update: I also tried using the menu bar, but perhaps there is a problem there, it only opens the File menu into the usual text based menu.)
