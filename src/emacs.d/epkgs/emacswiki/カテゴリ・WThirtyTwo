Where to get it:

* Official supported binaries http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/faq2.html#where-precompiled
** stable - <b>Emacs 23.2 (released 2010-05-08)</b>
*** ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/
*** http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/
*** Note that most people will want the bin file, not the barebin file. The barebin file includes only the compiled binaries, not the rest of Emacs. (It's intended for people who downloaded the source and then changed their mind about compiling it themselves.)
** pretest - Emacs 23.2 
*** ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/
*** http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/

* Unofficial/CVS Emacs (which means the Emacs currently in development, it is however normally very stable):
** **Builds from trunk**  -- http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/ -- **emacs-XXXXXXXX-bin-i386.zip**
*** SeanSieger usually builds Emacs from trunk
** **2011-04-02** -- http://ntemacs.sourceforge.net/ -- **Emacs bzr for w32** [24.0.50.1]
*** Clean, optimized w32 build of latest Emacs development trunk (Bazaar).
*** Support for images enabled:
**** giflib-4.1.6
**** jpeg-8c
**** libpng-1.4.4
**** libtiff-3.9.2
**** libxpm-3.5.8
**** zlib-1.2.5
*** Built with MinGW32/GCC-4.5.2, optimized for Prescott and above.
*** Uses 7z for distribution. Decompress the bin package anywhere (preferably C: or D: root) and run addpm.exe in \ntemacs24\bin.
** **Precompiled Emacs for Windows binaries** -- http://code.google.com/p/emacs-for-windows/
*** Source code checked out from latest Bazaar repository
*** Both stable and bleeding edge nightly build binaries
*** Update about every two months
** **2009-11-04** -- [[EmacsW32]] -- **CVS Emacs 23.1.50.1**
*** Does some extra setup to work better on MS-Windows and includes some unix programs (grep etc) from gnuwin32 and image libraries. It is also slightly patched for the same reason.
*** For other reasons the packages also includes [NxmlMode nXhtml].
*** Untested versions of EmacsW32 (I use them myself though I am not satisfied enough with them) is uploaded more often to http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/DL/EmacsW32/test/.

Installation:

* [[EmacsW32]] -- an enhancement and an installation program for Emacs on MS-Windows. '''Note 1:''' It is also a run time environment including keyboard adjustments, printing etc. '''Note 2:''' It can also extract the Emacs MS-Windows binaries .tar.gz file (using 7-zip internally).
* [[EmacsPortable]] -- Another enhancement and installation program for Emacs on MS-windows especially customized for PortableApplications.  '''Note 1:''' It is also a run time environment including keyboard adjustments for either viper, ergemacs or standard keys, printing (taken from a version of EmacsW32) etc. '''Note 2:''' It can also extract the Emacs MS-Windows binaries .tar.gz file. However, this is done by including the appropriate GnuWin32 binaries instead of relying of 7-zip. '''Note 3:''' This will run on portable drives, and should allow customization of pacakges installed.  It will also install locally.  When running locally AND a portable apps usb drive with EmacsPortable is inserted, the "HOME" directory is changed to the USB drive.  Hence there are portable customizations between each computer.  Just insert your USB drive!

* MsWindowsDotEmacs -- About the .emacs (or _emacs) initialization file on MS-Windows

Printing:

* From the FAQ, printing under MS-Windows: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/faq6.html#printing - but this is not uptodate and all tips there does not work! There are only two ways to print from Emacs that always works on MS-Windows, and that are PrintWithWebBrowser and using Ghostscript/GSview.

Reading proprietary file formats:

Font Smoothing, also known as !ClearType:

* There is a small bug due to incomplete MS documentation of the !ClearType api which causes text glitches during scrolling.  As such, !ClearType support is disabled in 21.3.  The buggy version is enabled in 21.1 and may be a useful alternative for those who don't mind the occasional display bug and being a few versions behind.
