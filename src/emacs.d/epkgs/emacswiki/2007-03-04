I just noticed this on emacs devel:

 From: Richard Stallman

 Once Emacs 22 is released, I would like to hand over Emacs maintenance
 to one person or a small team.  The new maintainer or maintainers
 would take responsibility for making sure new releases are made and
 that they are reliable, and for focusing attention on priority
 projects for improvement.

This feels... strange.
