PolicySwitch is a WindowConfiguration navigation utility by
ChristofferSHansen.  It can be downloaded here:

Lisp:policy-switch.el

A "policy" is defined as a list of
configurations.  PolicySwitch's configurations hold more
information than Emacs' window-configuration objects (which
cannot be inspected).  In addition to the window-configuration object,
the config holds a list of window data (through a call to (winner-win-data)).
WinnerMode is thus used by PolicySwitch to inspect configurations.

Persistence is achieved in the following way.  A configuration is
persistent if its internal buffers can be restored through calls
to either DeskTop (a), a function in
policy-switch-buffer-mode-handlers (b), or if buffer has a
buffer-file-name.  Unscriptable objects such as buffer and window
configuration objects (which is stored internally by PolicySwitch
for performance reasons) are set to nil when Emacs exits.  That way,
PolicySwitch knows that a policy needs to be restored when Emacs
starts.
