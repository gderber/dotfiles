=== Huh? ===

 ;;; Commentary:
 ;; 
 ;; Just a small hack I did while playing with GhostScript, trying to
 ;; create PDF files from PostScript files.
 ;;
 ;; It does little more than the ps2pdf script that comes with
 ;; GhostScript. Some handy functions to create PDF files from Emacs
 ;; buffers are provided though.
 ;;
 ;; If you use Windows you probably don't have GhostScript
 ;; installed. Get it from here: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/. Make
 ;; sure you get one of the "GPL Ghostscript" versions.
