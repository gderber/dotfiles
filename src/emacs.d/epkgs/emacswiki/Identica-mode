== Store Login Info in ~/.netrc ==

In the old days, people used to store their ftp connection information in the [http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch10s03.html#netrc .netrc file]. If you read your login and password from this file, you can share your Emacs init file without embarassing yourself. Just remember this particular [EmacsChannelQuotes #emacs quote]:

<Viiru-> Thats not your real password, I hope?
<hessian> fuck

Here's some code to initialize your login and password from the netrc file:

{{{
(when (require 'netrc nil t)
  (autoload 'identica-mode "identica-mode" nil t)
  (let ((identica (netrc-machine (netrc-parse "~/.netrc") "identi.ca" t))) ; remove this `t' if you didn't specify a port
    (setq identica-password (netrc-get identica "password") ; if it's last, avoid doing C-M-x in public spaces at least ;-)
          identica-username (netrc-get identica "login"))))
}}}

All entries have to be on one line for `netrc-parse' to bunch them together, so use something like:

    machine identi.ca login myusername password mydifficultpassword


== faux identica-mode using ERC/XMPP ==
If you, like me, like using ERC/XMPP rather than a full-blown identi.ca mode, you can still get some identi.ca features into your conversation with update@identi.ca. 

I've renamed update@identi.ca to "dent", the following makes tags,
nicks and groups clickable. Should work even for Twitter users...
{{{
(defun erc-button-follow-identica-tag (tag)
  (interactive)
  (browse-url (concat "http://identi.ca/tag/" tag)))
(defun erc-button-follow-identica-group (group)
  (interactive)
  (browse-url (concat "http://identi.ca/group/" group)))
(defun erc-button-follow-identica-nick (nick)
  (interactive)
  (browse-url (concat "http://identi.ca/" nick)))

(add-to-list 'erc-button-alist
	     '("#\\([^
 	][^
 	]*\\)" 0 (equal (buffer-name) "dent") erc-button-follow-identica-tag 1) )
(add-to-list 'erc-button-alist
	     ("!\\([^
 	][^
 	]*\\)" 0 (equal (buffer-name) "dent") erc-button-follow-identica-group 1))
(add-to-list 'erc-button-alist
	     ("<dent> \\([^:][^:]*\\):" 1 (equal (buffer-name) "dent") erc-button-follow-identica-nick 1))

(add-to-list 'erc-button-alist ("@\\([^
 	][^
 	]*\\)" 0 (equal (buffer-name) "dent") erc-button-follow-identica-nick 1))
}}}

I tried using it on Emacs 23.2 but unfortunately it doesnt work for me. Everytime it tries to 
update it says Unauthorized. Though giving the same credentials into the web interface its 
working. Any idea how to fix that?

Worked for me on Emacs 23.2 with the release available as at 2010-08-29. Perhaps the problem was related to the sort of certificate issues described on the [[TwitteringMode]] page? -- Alexis
