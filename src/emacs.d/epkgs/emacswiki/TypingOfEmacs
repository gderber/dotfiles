: typing.el --- The Typing Of Emacs

You can get the source code here:

* Lisp:typing.el

A game for fast typers!  A game for Emacs!

This is a game inspired by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Typing_of_the_Dead The Typing Of The Dead].
That game itself is a parody of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_the_Dead_2 The House Of The Dead].  In the latter,
players use a light gun to shoot zombies and other undead.  In the
former, players have to *type* the names of the undead in order to
shoot them.  The Typing Of Emacs is the parody of the parody, since
there are no undead (except possibly for the user staring at Emacs).

In order to play, choose any buffer containing a lot of text and type
M-x typing-of-emacs RET to start the game.  Traditionally used files
are the source code of the package, the Emacs NEWS file, and
/usr/dict/words.

== Installation ==

In order to install, put the file somewhere on your `load-path' and
add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

 (autoload 'typing-of-emacs "typing" "The Typing Of Emacs, a game." t)

== Sample Session ==

Here is a sample session of the game, played with the source code
itself:
