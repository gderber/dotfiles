Gnus supports FormatFlowed text when both sending and receiving messages, but it doesn't actually /flow/ the text to windows boundaries like other mail clients do. Doing so requires heavy tinkering, as discussed below.

== What is flowed text? ==

See FormatFlowed.

== Gnus and the hard reality ==

##format=flowed## is enabled by default in Gnus, in the sense that encoded messages are correctly decoded and rewrapped according to `fill-flowed-display-column' (which is usually `fill-column'), but that's about it.

The easiest way to deal with ##format=flowed## is to avoid it: if you want dynamic reflowing, simply unfold encoded lines to full length and setup article buffers to wrap:

{{{

(setq fill-flowed-display-column nil)

(add-hook 'gnus-article-mode-hook
  (lambda ()
    (setq
      truncate-lines nil
      word-wrap t)))

}}}

This will make Gnus behave as most other mail clients.

Composing or replying an article with long lines will choose a more resilient encoding such as `quoted-printable' by default.

Just enabling `use-hard-newlines' in `message-mode' (as documented) is *not enough* to compose a flowed message and will most likely (as of 01/2011) kill all the formatting in your message.

== Displaying and composing flowed messages ==
The following only works since Emacs 23, where `word-wrap' and `truncate-lines' was introduced. We can use Emacs' built-in word-wrapping functionality and avoid `auto-fill' and `use-hard-newlines' entirely with the following ([http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.gnus.user/14508 source]):

{{{

(defun harden-newlines ()
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (while (search-forward "\n" nil t)
      (put-text-property (1- (point)) (point) 'hard t))))

(setq fill-flowed-display-column nil)

;; The following line is needed since emacs 24.1:
(setq gnus-treat-fill-long-lines nil)

(add-hook 'message-setup-hook
  (lambda ()
    (when message-this-is-mail
      (turn-off-auto-fill)
      (setq
	truncate-lines nil
	word-wrap t
	use-hard-newlines t))))

(add-hook 'message-send-hook
  (lambda ()
    (when use-hard-newlines
      (harden-newlines))))

(add-hook 'gnus-article-mode-hook
  (lambda ()
    (setq
      truncate-lines nil
      word-wrap t)))

}}}

The gotcha here is to avoid using `use-hard-newlines' entirely, and simply compose a message with long lines. In `message-send-hook' all newlines are converted to hard newlines, forcing Gnus to post a ##format=flowed## messages, preserving the existing formatting.

By default, composing a flowed message is only enabled for mail, but it also works for groups coming from mail-to-news gateways such as [http://www.gmane.org GMane]. Change `message-setup-hook' accordingly if you wish to do that.
