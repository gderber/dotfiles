[[http://github.com/aidalgol/elwiki|The Elwiki project]] is an attempt by [[aidalgol]] (of #emacs fame) to write a wiki engine that can run the EmacsWiki in EmacsLisp.

It uses [[Elnode]] as a webserver and [[Creole]] for converting pages to HTML.

NicFerrier wrote about [[Elwiki]] in his [[http://nic.ferrier.me.uk/blog/2013_01/year-in-emacs|2013 plan]] and gave a [[Emacs Conference 2013 Emacsing the EmacsWiki|talk at EmacsConf 2013]].

== NicFerrier and AlexSchroeder talk EmacsWiki -> Elwiki ==

NicFerrier and AlexSchroeder had [[Nic and Alex talking about Elwiki|a conversation]] on #emacswiki about //the plan//. [[Nic_and_Alex_talking_about_Elwiki|A log of the conversation was made]].

Alex gave a bunch of useful links:

* WikiRss - is a list of RSS feeds the current Wiki spits out, these will all need to be duplicated
** Elwiki does history via Git logs so we need to write transforms from Git to all of these

* [[Gists]] - shows how to embed gists within the EmacsWiki - needs to be replicated by [[Creole]] or [[Elwiki]]
* [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=version|action=version]] - shows the current wiki conversion code
