If you build Emacs from source you're going to miss the native print dialog available in CarbonEmacsPackage.
Here's how to get it back:

# Get [https://github.com/zenitani/elisp mac-print-mode.el] and put it on your LoadPath.
# Get [http://fly.srk.fer.hr/~hniksic/emacs/htmlize.el htmlize.el] and put it in your LoadPath or download the package.
# Get [http://hmdt.jp/coral/ coral 1.3]
## copy ##bin/coral.app## into ##/Applications##
## copy ##bin/coral## into ##/usr/local/bin## and edit it so that it calls ##/Applications/coral.app/Contents/MacOS/coral##
# Add the following to your ##.emacs##:

{{{
(when (require 'mac-print-mode nil t)
  (mac-print-mode 1)
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-p") 'mac-print-buffer))
}}}

Now ##M-p## should automatically export the current page as HTML and produce a nice Mac OS print dialog that prints it.
