This little package was forked from KanjiDictionary by AlexSchroeder.
It contains wizards to produce FlashCard files from a number of
electronically distributed dictionaries in the KANJIDIC and EDICT
format (this includes JDDICT for Japanese-German, ENAMDIC for Japanese
proper names, and COMPDIC for Japanese-English computing and
communications vocabulary).

== Getting Dictionaries ==

If you are looking for dictionary files, here is the master archive in
Australia, including links to some US mirrors.  The original site is
often overloaded, so I've added the finland mirror as well.

* ftp://ftp.cc.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/00INDEX.html
* ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/culture/japan/mirrors/monash/pub/nihongo/

Examples:

* kanjidic (more than 6000 Kanji in the JIS X 0208 Standard)
* kanj212 (more than 5000 Kanji in the JIS X 0212 Standard)
* edict (more than 90000 Japanese/English entries)
* jddict.v02 (more than 11000 Japanese/German entries)

Failed:

* JMdict (XML file incorporating all the other dictionary files)

Writing an XML parsing wizard is on the TODO list.  If you have an
example you want to use, let me know.
