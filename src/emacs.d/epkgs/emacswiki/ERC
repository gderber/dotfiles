ERC is a powerful, modular, and extensible Emacs InternetRelayChat client.

== Obtaining ERC ==
ERC is part of the GNU project.  It is included with recent versions of GNU Emacs.

With an older version of Emacs, you might need to install it separately, e.g. under Ubuntu you would do something like <code>sudo apt-get install erc</code>.

For a brief history of the development of ERC and access to older versions, code repositories, and mailing list archives see ErcProjectHistory.

=== Included with GNU Emacs ===
ERC is included in released versions of GNU Emacs since v22.3.

See ErcExtraModules to find out how to get the few modules which were not able to be included with ERC in Emacs due to licensing and dependency issues.

=== Ports and packages ===
The XEmacs ERC Package sources are at http://cvs.xemacs.org/viewcvs.cgi/XEmacs/packages/xemacs-packages/erc/

Debian users can just apt-get install erc, or use one of the emacs22 or emacs-snapshot-* packages in experimental and unstable.  The Debian ERC package is updated at every major or minor release.  Usually, you should expect a new release every month or two.

Gentoo users can just emerge app-emacs/erc or app-xemacs/erc (for some reason portage has a hard time figuring out which). At present this is the latest release candidate.

=== Development version ===
See ErcDevelopment to find instructions on how to get the development version using git. Or if you prefer, you can download the most recent development snapshot: [http://mwolson.org/static/dist/erc-latest.tar.gz erc-latest.tar.gz] or [http://mwolson.org/static/dist/erc-latest.zip erc-latest.zip].

ERC also comes bundled with EmacsFromCVS[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.erc.general/750].

Note that ErcDevelopment and EmacsFromCvs can contain two separate branches of ERC and are therefore not quite identical. The modules ErcBbdb and ErcSpeak are not available in the Emacs version, for example.

== User manual ==
An info manual is now included with ERC.  It's also available on-line in several forms:

# HTML (single file):https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/erc.html
# HTML (multiple files):https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/erc/index.html
 

== Quickstart ==
* Download the .tar.gz file and extract it (tar -xzf ''filename'')
: the latest release, erc-5.3.tar.gz (or erc-5.3.zip), extracts to a directory called erc-5.3/
: Development snapshots extract to a directory called erc/
* Move the newly created directory to, for example, ~/elisp/erc
* And put the following in your InitFile:
{{{
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/erc")
(require 'erc)
}}}
* XEmacs users skip the above and get the [http://www.xemacs.org/Develop/packages.html#erc XEmacs erc Package]

* To connect, call M-x erc (better: M-x erc-select)
* To customize how ERC works: M-x customize-group RET erc RET
* ERC comes with a lot of small modules that do stuff for you. Recent versions of ERC let you just M-x customize-variable RET erc-modules RET. For previous versions, add a (require 'erc-FOO) to your InitFile to use them.

== Setting up ERC to work right for you ==

The easiest way to configure ERC is to do M-x customize-group RET erc RET.  This will open a buffer with all possible customizable settings organized in groups.  Even if you want to add things to your Initfile manually, you might find some settings you didn't know about by looking around.

Bug: using customize to set erc-spelling-dictionaries saves the (buffername . dictionary) elements as pairs instead of lists.
