RichardStallman is asking for help in verifying CVS diffs for Emacs:

: It would be very useful for someone to take overall charge of the
verification activity--to make sure that at least the important files
do get checked.  I can't do it myself, though; I don't have time.
(Since my elbow broke, I have barely been able to work on Emacs at
all.)

: Can someone volunteer to do this?

Context: Savannah was compromised, and slowly they are bringing the
system back.  At the moment they are trying to help maintainers figure
out wether their particular source trees were compromised.
