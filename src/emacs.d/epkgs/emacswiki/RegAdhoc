Don't you have a good rule for naming Emacs [[register]]s? Do you
easily forget where the registers point in the [[buffer]]?
##regadhoc.el## provides the following:

* Add registers automatically: You can skip the process to
consider a name.
* Show which line a register points to in the [[minibuffer]]
when you want to jump: You can see and select it in the
minibuffer. Use SPC to jump to the latest register.
