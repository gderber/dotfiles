Love it! I just came across this and have been using it in conjunction
with highline-mode.

It has, however, some very entertaining behavior when combined with
linum.el. I'm trying to codify the exact behavior, as it's a bit tough
to describe. -- MichaelWilson

I've been looking at the various column highlighting modes and vline is very sluggish.  
I seems to be working the entire buffer instead of just the visible screen

Drew's col-highlight is more performant.

It seems that Emacs 23 cannot load <tt>[[vline.el]]</tt>, at least in Windows:

<pre>
GNU Emacs 23.0.60.1 (i386-mingw-nt5.1.2600)
 of 2008-10-03 on LENNART-69DE564
Windowing system distributor `Microsoft Corp.', version 5.1.2600
configured using `configure --with-gcc (3.4) --no-opt --cflags -Ic:/g/include -fno-crossjumping'
</pre>

I get this error when I try to load it. Any ideas?

  Invalid read syntax: "?"

I filed bug
[[http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1187|#1187]],
but you never know if they will fix it. Perhaps a fix is (also) in
order for ##vline.el## itself? -- DrewAdams

I fixed it by your mail. Thanks! -- Sugawara
