This is Andreas Fuchs's wiki page. My home page containing some emacs stuff is located at:

I am located in Vienna, Austria and I have been an emacs fan since 1999 (Halloween, actually, when I launched my first successful attempt at getting Gnus to work). Now I extensively use  CategoryGnus, EmacsIRCClient (after having used ZenIRC for almost 1 1/2 years) and TrampMode.  Aka. [::antifuchs]
