It looks like several of these projects are abandoned. emacs-rails, specifically, has not been updated since 2009. Rinari has not been updated for over a year, which is not necessarily a really bad sign, but it also appears that certain functionality of the project no longer works (it no longer detects Rails projects).

Maybe try sending a bug report about those problems, and see if you get a response...
