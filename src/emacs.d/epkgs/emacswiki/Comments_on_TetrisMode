Is there any way to have tetris-mode use two characters (block glyphs) side-by-side for each "pixel" or tile of the board?
The natural proportions of characters makes this tetris very narrow and difficult to play. This is tetris-mode in
console emacs, of course. The X11-windowed emacs does not draw using characters.
