Hello, and welcome to my EmacsWiki homepage (such as it is).

I am a recent convert from <nowiki>FreeBSD</nowiki> to Debian GNU/Linux, and from vi to GNU Emacs. In the months to come I hope to contribute what I learn so that other newbies (that's "GNUbies" to you Free Software geeks, right??) can avoid wasting as much time with pointless fiddling as I have. Feel free to visit (and help out with) http://www.gornk.org/, an ambitious side-project of mine. 

: Looks to me like gornk.org should run a wiki...  :)  Welcome to the Emacs Wiki. -- AlexSchroeder
