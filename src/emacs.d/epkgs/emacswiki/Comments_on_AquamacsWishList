File Comparison.
I need ability to clone opened document to another split view.
Like Notepad++ did.
So i can see my code at 200 line number in Left side split view, while i write new code at 1200 line number in Right side split view for the same opened file.

@GEO: Have you tried `C-x 4 c'  (`clone-indirect-buffer-other-window')?
