==Tips==
* If current mark is active, command "elisp-format-region" will format region you select, otherwise it will format defun around point.

* If you want format many files, you can marked them in dired, and use command "elisp-format-dired" to format marked files in dired.

* You can format special file through command "elisp-format-file".

* By default, when you format *huge* file, it will hang emacs. So you can use command `elisp-format-file-batch' make format process at background.

* You also can use command `elisp-format-directory' format all recursive elisp files in special directory.

* By default, when you use command `elisp-format-directory' format too many elisp fields, it will hang emacs. So you can use command `elisp-format-directory-batch' make format process at background.

* If you're lazy, you can use command "elisp-format-library" format special library and don't need to input long file path.

==Notes==
I can't ensure this package will do a perfect work with all situations, I have test it with all elisp files that are builtin GNU Emacs 23.0.60.1. So please let me know if you have any suggestion or bug. -- AndyStewart
