''%%FuQiao%%:'' Now that you've corrected the spelling of %%XinJiang%%, I know where that is!  I did some traveling there back in 1988 --- no doubt long before you were born there!  A 3.5-day train ride from Beijing to [[WikiPedia:Urumqi|Urumqi]] (aka Wulumuqi) followed by a 3.5-day bus ride to [[WikiPedia:Kashgar|Kashgar]] (aka Kashi), then back again.  A great trip that I will always remember.  The long hard-sleeper ride was a highlight, believe it or not.

FYI -- You don't need to wrap a `lambda' form in either `function' or `cl-function'.  Just the `lambda' form is enough, and is every bit as efficient (in EmacsLisp).

But if you need to use `lambda' with a Common-Lisp parameter list (not so, in the case I saw), then `cl-function' is needed (unless you load cl at runtime).  HTH.

I am reminded of QuotedLambda. :)

Drew: I was born in Urumqi (and I'm in Beijing now).  It takes only 33 hours from Beijing to Urumqi now.  I don't know where you are, but I'd like to do some traveling to places like Strasbourg and Lyon in the future.

`(function (lambda (...) (...)))' is used in many places in Emacs, like shell.el, webjump.el, files.el and so on.  What's the difference between those in Emacs and my expression?

Just a digression: The Mackenzie River and the canyons of the Nahanni National Park Reserve are also good places to travel.

To reply to your question, I'm in California now. Haven't done much traveling lately. (lambda...) and #'(lambda...) should act the same in all respects in Emacs Lisp, I believe (but not in other Lisps). I once asked the same question of StefanMonnier, and he said to just use (lambda...).

Sorry to butt in, but I too have travelled to Urumqi (in 1993), and also took that 3.5 day train journey from Beijing.
Highlights included a visit to the Tianshan mountains, the Taklamakan desert, and the ancient city of Dunhuang.
It seems that us emacs users have more in common than just emacs.
Drew are you coming to the emacs conference?

No, he won't.

Hi Joe.  No, unfortunately, I cannot make it to the conference.  But I'm glad it's taking place and hope you all have a great time.

I too spent a night up in %%TianShan%% (the one near Urumqi -- there are several mtns with the same name, I believe) in a yurt etc.  I imagine that many travelers visiting that area try to take in the sights there (like the alps, but with Kazak kids on horses etc.)

I missed Dunhuang on the way back to Beijing, unfortunately -- ran out of time.  But I did spend some time in Kashgar.  This was long ago, but it was a memorable trip.

Regards -- and thanks to Fuqiao for bringing back good memories by mentioning Xinjiang and Urumqi.
