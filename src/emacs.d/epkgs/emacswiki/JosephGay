I use GNU Emacs

* IM at work and at home using ERC and bitlbee (gilleylen on google talk)
* reading and composing mail over IMAP using [[Gnus]]
* web browsing (mostly technical docs) using [[w3m]]
* server administration using TrampMode
* identi.ca via bitlbee
* note taking, writing, agenda, and time clock in OrgMode
* SlimeMode for hacking in clojure and sbcl (in my spare time)

I am a vim convert. I used ViperMode for a few months, but I've now
dropped it completely. My transition was motivated initially by
Slime, and finally by the gradual realization that Emacs is the only
truly fun software package I've ever used.

Things I'd like to try/get working:
* Gnus---is it worth all the effort?

** I started with gnus (I learned emacs only because of Gnus), and I really
   like it, especially with a local IMAP server (Dovecot) to speed things up,
   and notmuch for fast email searches.  I have nearly 100.000 mails, and
   Gnus/notmuch make it managable. -- TassiloHorn

   Update: thanks Tassilo. I'm now using for Gnus for e-mail, news,
   and RSS (via gwene) and I've enjoyed it very much thus far.

* something to replace Google Reader, perhaps NewsTicker, Gnus?
  Update: I've mostly accomplished this with gwene and Gnus (GnusRss)

** I use newsticker, but with the plain interface, not the fancy tree view. For
   me, it does all I need, and it does work with any format.  The last time I
   tried gnus for that, it had some troubles with some feeds. -- TassiloHorn
