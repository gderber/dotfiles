I use Emacs.  I started using Emacs about 3 years ago and quickly became an addict.  Over the years I've started using it for more and more of my everyday tasks.  I'm finally starting to see the "Emacs is my operating system" point of view.

I've started authoring some Elisp hacks, and I'm finding that developing in Elisp is a joy.  In fact, it's lead me to start delving into ANSI Common Lisp.  I'm hoping to find a way to use Lisp more.
