I use Emacs 24.  I am an new to intermediate programmer and emacs user, but a fast learner.  My main interest is scientific computing, but I am very interested in leveraging emacs and Linux in a powerful way to increase my productivity.  [:My.Emacs] My .emacs can be found [https://github.com/zbeekman/.emacs.d/blob/master/init.el on github], although it is probably out of date. Edits, suggestions and comments are all welcome.

====My Blog====
I am planning on adding a blog to my [https://IzaakBeekman.com personal website.] An old blog entry about setting up subversion to use ediff as a graphical merge client can be found [http://zaakbeekman.blogspot.com/2011/04/using-emacs-ediff-as-graphical-merge.html here], but I am planning to unify and migrate my web presence to my new personal website.
