= Note =
As of May 2009, the functionality of this package was integrated into org-mode.
See the documentation for <code>org-timer-set-timer</code> for details
(however this only works in org-mode buffers).

= Tea-time =
Tea-time is an extension to emacs.
Kind of analog of gnome applet tea-time http://det.cable.nu/teatime/index.rbx?r=2.8.0

It allows you to set up time intervals and after this
interval is elapsed, Emacs will notify you with sound and notification.
It could be useful if you make a tea or if you would like to
be more productive by setting time limit for a task.

If available, notification would be done with great tool
mumbles ( http://www.mumbles-project.org )
If not, then simply use standard emacs message.

= Requirements: =

Tested on Emacs 23, but should work on any version.

= Installation: =

1. Download from http://github.com/krick/tea-time/tree/master,
   or simply <code>git clone git://github.com/krick/tea-time.git</code>

2. Add tea-time directory to the load path, if needed
  <code>(add-to-list "path-to-tea-time")</code> 

3. Add in your .emacs:
   <code>(require 'tea-time)</code>

4. Customize variable <code>tea-time-sound</code> via <code>M-x customize</code>
or simply  put <code>(setq tea-time-sound "path-to-sound-file")</code> in .emacs


= Usage: =

* <code>M-x tea-time</code>
 
	* Enter period in minutes if you want to start timer
        * Or press Enter without giving any number - if you would like to
        know how much time is left before the timer expires
 
* Use <code>M-x tea-timer-cancel</code> to cancel currently running timer.

* Suggested binding: <code>(define-key global-map "\C-ct" 'tea-time)</code>

= See Also: =

See TaskTimer for the inverse, i.e. start the timer (0:00) and then be able to determine how long the timer has been running (2 min 5 secs).
