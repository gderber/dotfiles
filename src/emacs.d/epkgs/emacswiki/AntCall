This simple snippet of elisp code calls ant (http://ant.apache.org/) from emacs

<pre>
(global-set-key [f5] 'ant-call)

(defun ant-call (target)
  "Call Ant's build.xml"
  (interactive "MAnt Target:")
  (let ((oldbuf (get-buffer "*ant-compilation*")))
    (if (not (null oldbuf))
	(kill-buffer "*ant-compilation*")))
  (let* ((buildfile (file-search-upward (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name)) "build.xml"))
	 (outbuf (get-buffer-create "*ant-compilation*"))
	 (curbuf (current-buffer))
	 )
    (switch-to-buffer-other-window outbuf)
    (insert "#> ant -f " buildfile " " target "\n")
    (switch-to-buffer-other-window curbuf)
    (call-process "ant" nil outbuf t "-f" buildfile target)
    ))

(defun file-search-upward (directory file)
  "search a file upward"
  (let* ((updir (file-truename (concat (file-name-directory directory) "../")))
	 (curfd   (if (not (string= (substring directory (- (length directory) 1)) "/"))
		      (concat directory "/" file)
		    (concat directory file))))
    (if (file-exists-p curfd)
	curfd
      (if (and (not (string= (file-truename directory) updir))
	       (< (length updir) (length (file-truename directory))))
	  (file-search-upward updir file)
	nil))))
</pre>

The real problem is that build.xml isn't in the same folder as the current java file. So alternatively a little script could do it.

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
while [ ! -e build.xml  ]; do
  if [ `pwd` = "/" ]; then
    echo "/ reached";
    exit 1;
  fi
  cd ..
done
ant $@
</pre>
