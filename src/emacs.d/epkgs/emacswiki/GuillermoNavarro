I am Guillermo Navarro (guille for short, or Guillermo Navarro Arribas for long). You may reach me at guillermo(dot)navarro(at)gmail(dot)com. My sort of [http://www.deic.uab.es/~guille home page]. 

I use Emacs for lots of things but mainly for editing, mail, web browsing, calendar/planner, and so on. Have been using it for some years but I discovered the real beauty of emacs when I knew JoseAntonioOrtegaRuiz and began to play with configuration files and extensions. Hope to contribute somehow (maybe starting by improving my elisp knowledge).

Congratulations for the wiki.
