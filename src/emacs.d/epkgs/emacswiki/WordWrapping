word-wrapping.el by RafaelSep√∫lveda is a MinorMode much like
AutoFillMode.  The difference is that it fills the paragraph when
point reaches the fill-column, instead of waiting for a white space
character.

Additionally, if auto-fill-mode is not active, fill-column is ignored
and the width of the [[Frame]] is used instead.
