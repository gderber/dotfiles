A SpreadSheet mode by DanielSpeyer:

* http://esheet.sourceforge.net

Selected strengths of Esheet from the web page:
                  
* Powerful formulas -- nearly as strong as Lisp, which is also available
* Extensibility -- just define new formula commands as new elisp function.
* General cell-reference support -- refer to cells by relative or absolute location, or combinations thereof

The example sheet has formulas as follows:

    +sum(range(1,y+0,x+-1,y+0))/sum(range(1,y+-1,x+-1,y+-1))
    =(/ (sum (range 1 y (- x 1) y)) (sum (range 1 1 (- x 1) 1)))
    +mean(range(x+0,y+-2,x+0,y+-1))

A note on ComparativeEmacsology, also from the web page:  Esheet runs
under both Emacs and XEmacs. The XEmacs support is older, more
reliable, and has a few added features (e.g. mouse support), but both
work for most purposes.
