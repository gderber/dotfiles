Once you install GNU Go, you will have access to gnugo.el.  Use `M-x gnugo' to play.

If you play on Windows with old versions of gnugo.el, you might be seeing lots of ^M.  There is probably a solution involving coding systems, but at the moment this quick and dirty fix using search and replace works for me:

    (autoload 'gnugo "gnugo" "Play Go" t)
    (defadvice gnugo-insertion-filter (before gnugo-coding-system-fix activate)
      (setq string (replace-regexp-in-string "\r" "" string)))

The extra ^M is indeed due to the coding system being hardcoded in gnugo.el as
latin-1-unix.  Better to use the default input coding system.  Whoever reading
this with GNU Go write privs should delete the "set-process-coding-system" line
(222) in gnugo.el. (Sorry about this over-specification bug. --ttn)

Standalone gnugo.el is developed apart from the GNU Go project, and is now part of GNU ELPA.  The homepage is now:

There is a mirror of [http://web.archive.org/web/20050310023415/http://www.glug.org/people/ttn/software/personal-elisp/standalone/gnugo.el-2.2.9 GnuGo2.2.9] (which appears to be the [http://web.archive.org/web/20051029073149/http://www.glug.org/people/ttn/software/personal-elisp/standalone/ latest] one) on the Wayback Machine, this seems to work with GNU Go 3.7.9 and Emacs 22.0.50.1 (2007-01-30).

= MoGo =
Here is a simple major mode to interact with [http://www.lri.fr/~gelly/MoGo.htm MoGo]: Lisp:mogo.el.
It has been tested with GNU Emacs 22 and 21.

!MoGo a new very strong Go program also using GTP, the protocol also used by [http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/gnugo.html GNU go].  So, theoretically it shouldn't be too hard to modiy Lisp:gnugo.el so it can also use !MoGo as a backend, but I haven't really looked into this.
