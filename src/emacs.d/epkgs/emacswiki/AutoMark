AutoMark makes you free from pushing marks.

[[auto-mark.el]]

Here is my sample setting.

<pre>
(when (require 'auto-mark nil t)
  (setq auto-mark-command-class-alist
        '((anything . anything)
          (goto-line . jump)
          (indent-for-tab-command . ignore)
          (undo . ignore)))
  (setq auto-mark-command-classifiers
        (list (lambda (command)
                (if (and (eq command 'self-insert-command)
                         (eq last-command-char ? ))
                    'ignore))))
  (global-auto-mark-mode 1))
</pre>

I suggest to use VisibleMark with it.
