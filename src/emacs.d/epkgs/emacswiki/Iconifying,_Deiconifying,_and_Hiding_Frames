[[fr:Iconifier, Desiconifier, et Cacher des Frames]]

= Summary =

Library <tt>[[frame-cmds.el]]</tt> has commands for iconifying and restoring [[frame]]s, tiling frames, and more.

* Use `C-M-z' or `C-x C-z' to iconify/hide all frames.
* Use `C-M-z' in a lone frame to restore all frames.
* Use `C-mouse-1' in the [[minibuffer]] to restore all frames.
* Use `C-mouse-1' in [[Dired]] to mark/unmark a file.
* Use `C-mouse-3' on a [[mode line]] to remove a [[window]] from a frame.
* Use `tile-frames-horizontally' and `tile-frames-vertically' to tile frames.


= La Petite Histoire =

When things are frame-oriented, you can end up with lots of
frames. So, I created this command:
* `iconify-everything' -- Iconify all frames at once.

However, this created an icon for each frame, cluttering up the Unix
desktop (or the MS Windows task bar prior to Windows XP). So, I created
this alternative command:

* `hide-everything' -- Iconify minibuffer-frame; make all
others invisible.

With this command, only a single icon is created. In Windows prior to XP, the
effect is similar to that provided by Windows XP. However, in XP, the
icons are grouped in a single task-bar icon, but they are individually
available as a popup menu. With `hide-everything', you
lose access to individual frames.

Because of this lack of individual-frame access from the single icon,
I created a toggle command: hide all frames or show (raise)
them again:

* `show-hide' -- In a lone frame, restore the frame configuration that was current when all frames were iconified or hidden.  If
two or more frames are visible, call `hide-everything' to
hide them.

In Windows XP, `iconify-everything' might be as useful as
`show-hide', because you can use the Windows popup menu
to raise a frame. In Unix, Linux, and other Windows versions,
`show-hide' is generally more useful, because it uses
only one icon.

As a variant of `show-hide', I created this mouse command
(bound to ##[C-down-mouse-1]##) that acts differently,
depending on where the mouse is clicked.

* `mouse-show-hide-mark-unmark' -- If clicked in the
minibuffer, call `show-hide'. If clicked in [[Dired]],
mark/unmark the file or directory clicked. Otherwise, display
`mouse-buffer-menu' as a popup menu.

Another useful mouse command is this:

* `mouse-iconify/map-frame' (<code>[mode-line
mouse-3]</code>) -- Iconify frame clicked on, if now mapped (visible).
Map (raise) it if now iconified.
