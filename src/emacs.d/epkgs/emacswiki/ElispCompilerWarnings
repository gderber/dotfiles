advice for eliminating warnings thrown by the Emacs lisp compiler

==free variables==
see FreeVariable

==not defined at runtime==
warnings of the following form

<pre>
Warning: the function `uniquify-maybe-rerationalize-w/o-cb' might not be defined at runtime.
</pre>

are thrown when the compiler can't find the definition of a function used in the current program, they can normally  be resolved by placing a call to the `declare-function' see [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/elisp/html_node/Declaring-Functions.html Declaring-Functions] command in the top of the affected file.

If the `declare-function' command does not work, then visit the file defining the function, and ensure that the function in question is not used in that file *before* it is defined.
