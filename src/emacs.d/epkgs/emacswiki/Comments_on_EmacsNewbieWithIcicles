From [[XueFuqiao]]:2012-11-20 12:56 UTC:

* Vanilla GNU Emacs [now] also has a complete style named `substring'.
* `C-h l' displays last 300 input keystrokes [now].
* [Help keys also for these:] keys (`C-h k'), variables (`C-h v'), language environments (`C-h L'), coding systems (`C-h C'), input methods (`C-h I') and packages (`C-h P'). 

Reply (DrewAdams): Yes, thanks.  I've updated the text to try to clarify these things.  I didn't want to confuse newbies by entering into details about matching methods, but I agree that it's perhaps better to be more accurate here.

Are there any <nowiki>YouTube</nowiki> screencasts or demonstrations that show Icicles in action?
