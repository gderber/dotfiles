With some configuration, !TeXniscope can be used as pdf-Viewer in
Aquamacs Emacs with support for source → preview jumping and reverse.

== Warning

Aquamacs now supports Skim, a free PDF viewer which can automatically refresh the view after your LaTeX file is compiled.  Skim integration is fully automatic.


== How To...

In the following, it is assumed that Aquamacs Emacs and !TeXniscope are
installed in /Applications.

At first, we configure !TeXniscope as pdf-Viewer in AUCTeX.  Type

<code>
M-x customize-variable RET TeX-output-view-style RET
</code>

Now the customization buffer should open. Look for the entry <code>^pdf$</code>. Select
„Value Menu“ at „Choice“ and enter
<code>.</code>
and after "Command"
<code>open -a /Applications/TeXniscope.app %o</code>

Now, we set !TeXniscope to open the source document in Aquamacs on
Command-E. Open !TeXniscope Preferences and enter the following at
"Editor command":

<code>/Applications/Aquamacs\ Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient</code>

At Aquamacs, type
<code>M-x server-start</code>

To automate this, you can add the following to your Preferences.el (.emacs):

<code>(server-start)</code>

For source → preview jumping to pdf files it is necessary to modify
the file "txs-search.el", which is part of the !TeXniscope application
bundle
(/Applications/TeXniscope.app/Contents/Resources/txs-search.el).
Look for the line that states

<code>(dvi-file (concat (file-name-sans-extension master-file) ".dvi"))</code>

and alter it to

<code>(dvi-file (concat (file-name-sans-extension master-file) ".pdf"))</code>
so that Aquamacs searches for a PDF file instead of a DVI.

An alternative version of the txs-search.el package that automatically switches from dvi to pdf 
depending on AucTeX mode is available at: http://jobsluder.net/miscdownloads/txs-search.zip 
as of Feb. 3, 2007.  Unzip and read instructions at the top of txs-search.el

Add the following lines to your Preferences.el (.emacs):

<code>(load (expand-file-name
     "/Applications/TeXniscope.app/Contents/Resources/txs-search.el"))</code>

<code>(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook (lambda () (local-set-key "\C-c\C-j"
     'txs-jump-to-line)))</code>

Note that this changes the key binding C-c C-j, which normally inserts a new
item in AUCTeX, to jump to the PDF file. Change it to you liking. 

Finally, you need to use a package when compiling LaTeX documents.
Install "pdfsync.sty" and add <code>\usepackage{pdfsync}</code>
to the preamble of your LaTeX document.
If it works, you should see a green dot in the PDF file
somewhere near the place where the text you click at in your source
file appears. Unfortunately, it’s not at the exact place.

Jumping back from the pdf to the source should now work as well. You
can delete the argument

<code>-a/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/Emacs-server-call</code>

(remaining <code>--no-wait +%line "%file"</code>)

at "Editor arguments" in !TeXniscope Preferences, as
"Emacs-server-call" does not exist in Aquamacs.
