==What is ScreenShot ?==
ScreenShot is mode to automate taking a screenshot.

==Why the need for ScreenShot ?==
Taking a screenshot and uploading a server are cumbersome. So let's automate them.

==Install==
You must have installed ImageMagick and optional scp and [[Yaoddmuse]].

Put Lisp:screenshot.el in your load-path, add
{{{
    (require 'screenshot)
    (setq screenshot-schemes              ; edit as you like
          '(
            ;; To local image directory
            ("local"
             :dir "~/images/")            ; Image repository directory
            ;; To current directory
            ("current-directory"          ; No need to modify
             :dir default-directory)
            ;; To remote ssh host
            ("remote-ssh"
             :dir "/tmp/"                 ; Temporary saved directory
             :ssh-dir "www.example.org:public_html/archive/" ; SSH path
             :url "http://www.example.org/archive/")  ; Host URL prefix
            ;; To EmacsWiki (need yaoddmuse.el)
            ("EmacsWiki"                 ; Emacs users' most familiar Oddmuse wiki
             :dir "~/.yaoddmuse/EmacsWiki/"  ; same as yaoddmuse-directory
             :yaoddmuse "EmacsWiki")         ; You can specify another Oddmuse Wiki
            ;; To local web server
            ("local-server"
             :dir "~/public_html/"           ; local server directory
             :url "http://127.0.0.1/")))     ; local server URL prefix
    (setq screenshot-default-scheme "local") ; default scheme is "local"
}}}    
in ~/.emacs

==Usage==
M-x screenshot prepares to take a screenshot. It prompts for a image file name and a scheme name. Then set up screen and press C-c C-c! Emacs invokes import command (ImageMagick) and save the screenshot to local. Finally Emacs uploads it to remote server ASYNCHRONOUSLY (via scp or [[Yaoddmuse]]).

After taking a screenshot, the URL of the image are ready to yank. Press C-y!

==Customize==
All below option can customize by: M-x customize-group RET screenshot RET

`screenshot-schemes' is a list to contain schemes. Edit as you like.

`screenshot-take-delay` is delay time to take a screenshot. It is recommend to have a delay time to enable us to take a screenshot of other application.

==See Also==
[[Yaoddmuse]] has a screenshot feature (M-x yaoddmuse-post-screenshot). On the other hand, ScreenShot provides a unified way to take a screenshot in various scheme.
