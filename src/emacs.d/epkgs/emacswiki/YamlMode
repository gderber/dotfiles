<code>yaml-mode.el</code> helps you edit [http://www.yaml.org/ YAML] <code>.yml</code> files.

Get it on http://github.com/yoshiki/yaml-mode

And also available as DebianPackage:yaml-mode.

It features font locking for data forms and comments, and some electric keys to help with block literals.

== Spaces vs. Tabs ==

<code>yaml-mode.el</code> enforces spaces instead of TABs in yaml-mode, regardless of emacs configuration.

If you wish to have Return key automatically indent cursor on new line, add the following to emacs config:

{{{
(add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (define-key yaml-mode-map "\C-m" 'newline-and-indent)))
}}}

== Indentation Tools ==

Another good accompanying mode for editing YAML files (and some other structured texts like Python) is  [https://gitlab.com/emacs-stuff/indent-tools/ indent-tools] as it provides functionality related to tree indentation, navigation and commenting.
