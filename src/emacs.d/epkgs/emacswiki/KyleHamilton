Hi, I'm Kyle ([::kyanha]), reachable at the NATO phonetic alphabet (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet) reduction of: Alfa Echo Romeo Oscar Whiskey Oscar Lima Foxtrot at Golf Mike Alfa India Lima dot Charlie Oscar Mike.  I'm a new user of Aquamacs, and a new user of emacs in general; I've made the switch because I'm finally going through the StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms book, which uses Scheme to illustrate its principles.

I'm sick of trying to deal with all of the irritating parentheses without having an automatic paren-handler.  Since Scheme is a Lisp dialect, and since emacs is written primarily with another Lisp dialect, I'm hoping that I'll have a lot more fun writing it in emacs than vi or any other text editor. :)

Welcome to the wiki! If you want to really get into it, you might also want to check out SlimeMode. I have never really gotten to use it, however. I also faintly remember there being info out there on rewriting the SICP examples in Emacs Lisp. Anyway, congratulations on choosing SICP. I remember that it blew me away years after I had started working in IT. Remember to check the [[Scheme]] page for more info. -- AlexSchroeder
