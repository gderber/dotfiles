Procomm-mode is a basic major mode for writing scripts in the ASPECT scripting language.

ASPECT is the scripting language integrated into the Procomm Plus terminal emulation product and can be used to automate complex procedures and build simple GUIs.

This mode was written to conform to ASPECT as it appeared in Procomm Plus version 4.8.

It provides basic syntax highlighting, indentation & formatting.
