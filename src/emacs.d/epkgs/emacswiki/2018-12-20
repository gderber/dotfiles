Apparently a regular expression on [[BannedHosts]] caused an error whenever somebody wanted to edit the wiki (except for administrators like me), starting 2018-12-16. Sorry! It should be fixed, now.
I also took the opportunity to clean the entire list of banned hosts. A new start for everybody.
All your spam and vandalism is forgiven, until you do it again. Hah! Can you resist the lure,
spammer? Oh well. We'll ban them again, for another year. :)

To everybody else: happy holiday season and thanks for editing the wiki. If you notice weird stuff,
please send me an email. That's the best way to reach me:
[https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/Contact alex@gnu.org] would be a good place to
start, for example.

Cheers\\
Alex
