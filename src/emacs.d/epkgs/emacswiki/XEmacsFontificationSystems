There are four main options for fontification (syntax highlighting) in XEmacs. This page discusses the pros and cons of each. Please feel free to edit this page: just click the "Edit this page" link at the bottom. But, for copyright reasons, please do not copy and paste in any material; original writing only please.

== Plain old font-lock ==

Pros:

* foo
* bar

Cons:

* foo
* bar

== fast-lock ==

Pros:

* foo
* bar

Cons:

* foo
* bar

See also the [http://www.xemacs.org/Documentation/packages/html/edit-utils_28.html fast-lock documentation].

== lazy-lock ==

Pros:

* Can be configured to re-highlight syntactically correct on multi-line-relevant changes (e.g., starting /* in C-Mode)

Cons:

* Regular wakeups, even if no activity in xemacs (ca. 5% CPU Usage on an Core2Duo 2.x GHz).  This is very annoying.

== lazy-shot ==

Pros:

* foo
* bar

Cons:

* foo
* bar
