I am using emacs for little over 10 years. But still haven't mastered the beast(possible?), learning new things every other day. I have done some elisp, but not very much. Of course I like to show off my emacs/emacsclient setup to the non-users, and successfully converted a few, including my very own brother :-)

You can reach me at santosh at fossix dot org.
