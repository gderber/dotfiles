The new sgml-mode.el in Emacs (ie. ''not'' PsgmlMode) also does very simple indenting.

Here is a link to the latest copy:

* http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/emacs/emacs/lisp/textmodes/sgml-mode.el?rev=HEAD

Put it in your LoadPath and load it in your ~/.emacs:

    (require 'sgml-mode)

Take a simple example file:

    <book>
    <home>test</home>
    </book>

Put point on the second line and hit `M-x sgml-indent-line'.  The result should be the following:

    <book>
      <home>test</home>
    </book>

If you are looking for a familiar IDE tab and auto-indent setup, where TAB always puts a tab, and pressing enter indents to align with the previous line, this is what to put in your ~/.emacs:

  (add-hook 'sgml-mode-hook
    (function (lambda()
      (define-key
         sgml-mode-map
         (kbd "<tab>")
         (lambda () (interactive) (insert "\t")))
      (define-key
         sgml-mode-map
         (kbd "RET") 'newline-and-indent)
  )))
