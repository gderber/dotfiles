After I set up my first Linux (Slackware dual-booting with Windows 95) I heard that I had a choice between two serious text editors.  One was small, fast, and focused.  One was big, slow, and ambitious.  Naturally, as a believer in simple, single-purpose tools, I chose the small, fast, and focused editor.  A screenful of tildes, "eat flaming death", and a hard reboot later, I tried the big, slow, and ambitious editor, which not only provided me with a prominently labeled exit, but offered me a tutorial.

By so narrow a margin was I saved.

I use Emacs for writing, coding, and emailâ€”really as everything but a browser and a terminal.  Lately I've been spending a lot of time in customizing and extending it.  But then Emacs has been around longer than I have been alive and it is not unreasonable to expect that I will be using it for the rest of my life.  I see the time I spend in understanding it better as a permanent investment.

Also it's a painless way of learning Lisp, which I want to do anyway.
