<code>nroff-mode</code> is the Emacs major mode for editing nroff / troff / [http://www.gnu.org/software/groff/groff.html groff] documents, including man pages.

Here's some addons for <code>nroff-mode</code>

===Electric Nroff mode===

This is a minor mode that you can turn on or off with
`M-x electric-nroff-mode.  When the mode is on, each time you use <RET> to end a line that contains an nroff command that opens a kind of grouping, the matching nroff command to close that grouping is automatically inserted on the following line.  For example, if you are at the beginning of a line and type `. ( b RET>',
this inserts the matching command `.)b' on a new line following point.

===With Outline mode===

If you use Outline minor mode with Nroff mode, OutlineMode, heading lines are lines of the form `.H' followed by a number (the header level).

===Updating manpage date stamps automatically===

I'm using the following code in my init file, along with {{{header2.el}}} as described in AutomaticFileHeaders:

{{{
(defun update-last-modified-date-nroff ()
  (replace-match (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d" nil t) nil t nil 1))

(add-hook 'nroff-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (require 'header2)
            (make-local-variable 'file-header-update-alist)
            (register-file-header-action
             "^\\.TH[ \t]+[^\" \t]+[ \\t]+[^\" \t]+[ \t]+\\([-0-9]*\\)"
             'update-last-modified-date-nroff)
            (add-hook 'write-file-hooks 'auto-update-file-header nil t) ))
}}}

It handles .TH lines like the following:

{{{
.TH VM86 2 2009-04-29 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
}}}

===Viewing Nroff files in Emacs===

To preview a man page file with ManMode you can save to disk and use the usual <code>-l</code> option

    M-x man
    -l myfilename.1

Or similarly with WomanMode

    M-x woman-find-file
    myfilename.1

Or ManPreview runs <code>man</code> straight out of the buffer, so you don't have to save or even have a file for the buffer.
