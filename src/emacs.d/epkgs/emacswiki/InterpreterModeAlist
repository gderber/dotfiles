Something like this:

    (add-to-list 'interpreter-mode-alist '("python" . python-mode))

Where `python-mode' is AutoLoad""ed or already defined, and the file starts like this:

    #!/usr/bin/python

or:

    #!/usr/local/bin/python

The name of the executable is the relevant part.

See LoadPath.
