Many graphical operating systems represent programs and files with icons.  The following are icons used for Emacs.

* [http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/NewIcons.html New icons] -- Numerous icons collected and published by LennartBorgman.

On 2005-11-21 new icons by AndrewZhilin where [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2005-11/msg00982.html added] to Emacs.
These icons use the letters E and M stylized as the horns of a gnu.
The dark blue icons come in 16 and 24 pixel sizes and there is are alternatives sized 32 and 48 pixel looking like spiral-bound (paper) notebooks.

They are expected to be used by operating system distributors who combine GNU Emacs in conjuction with desktop systems like Gnome.  The icons are mentioned in the <tt>FOR-RELEASE</tt> file in Emacs's source distribution for the very purpose of noting Emacs package maintainers.
