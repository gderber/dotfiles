Anyone know about a problem with the gnu emacs mailing lists today? In particular, from help-gnu-emacs@gnu.org I haven't been getting the normal mail, but I have been getting zillions of spam messages (in German). Also, this site seems to be down: http://lists.gnu.org/. -- DrewAdams

German nazi spam has been flooding my mail account, too.  [http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/59562] -- AlexSchroeder

Thanks. I feel reassured that it's not just me. -- DrewAdams
