edited on the fly.

------------------------------
*Description*

Basically *eproject* manages a list of projects, where a project
is a list of files and a list of commands and is associated
with a directory.

If you open a project you get a menu with the files and it will
load the last viewed one.

You also get a menu for tool commands that can be fired with
one mouse-click or a keystroke. (can be just "make" but as well
anything else, typically stuff that you would not want to
remember when you revisit a project after some months)

Switching projects is easy and fast, two mouse clicks or three
keystrokes.  You can do something in one project, then switch
to another, do something there, and then switch back as if
you'd never left.

eproject has a text menu ("setup area") where you can
quick search an item (e.g. file) by pressing the first
letter(s). It works on terminals too.

All lists can be edited on the fly in the setup area.  The
data itself is stored per project in a file "eproject.cfg".
The project list is stored in "~/.emacs.d/eproject.lst".

eproject was tested with Emacs 23, it might work with late
Emacs 22.  To load eproject, add this line to your ~/.emacs:

      (load-file "/path/to/eproject.el")

*Development*

eproject is at http://repo.or.cz/w/eproject.git.  Constructive suggestions and patches are welcome to be pushed on the "mob" branch there:

    git push ssh://mob@repo.or.cz/srv/git/eproject.git your-branch:mob 

Where "your-branch" should be based on the remote mob branch. (See also http://repo.or.cz/h/mob.html)

*News*

2010-05-20 Version 0.4:
* Project configuration file (eproject.cfg) may exist under a different
  name and/or directory (This allows multiple projects in the same directory)
* Optional support for multi-isearch in the project files

------------------------------
*Anything Integration*

I have created a pair of sources for integrating [[Anything]] with eproject,
available here:

[[anything-eproject.el]]

*Comments*

(Note that this eproject is completely unrelated to another eproject, http://wiki.github.com/jrockway/eproject/.  FWIW, I had the name first. :) --- Jonathan Rockway) --- (Yep, same first name but unrelated. :) --- grischka)
