There are various "emacs powered" or "powered by GNU EMACS" logos and buttons around the place, but I can't find a definitive list or any distribution terms for them.

So, I'll start a list here and see what happens.

** http://www.zid.tugraz.at/lang/gnu_emacs_icon_grey.jpg The neatest one I've seen so far. It's what MarioLang has on his work page.
*** I've created this one, it's free, check it out at http://www.marcelotoledo.org/stuff/graphics/gnu_emacs_icon -- MarceloToledo

There are others, but I'm tired of that game now. See also http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=emacs+powered
