You can define ''anchors'' on a page.  You can then link to these anchors from another page or from the same page. Anchors can be hidden or visible.

See also [[Oddmuse:Local Anchor Extension]] for more on permanent anchors.

[:HiddenAnchors]
== Hidden Anchors ==

You can create a hidden anchor on a page to serve as the target of links. To define a hidden anchor, use square brackets and a single colon:

     [:MyHiddenAnchor]

You can link to a hidden anchor from the same page by preceding it with a pound sign (<code>#</code>) and enclosing this in double brackets. For example:

     See [[#MyHiddenAnchor]]

You can link to a hidden anchor from a different page by using the target page name, followed by a pound sign, all enclosed in double brackets. For example:

     See [[PageOfMyHiddenAnchor#MyHiddenAnchor]]

The name of a hidden anchor must be unique on its page; it need not be unique throughout the wiki.


[:VisibleAnchors]
== Visible Anchors ==

You can [::Create a Visible Anchor] on a page to serve as the target of links. A visible anchor is different from an HTML named anchor such as <code><A NAME="..."></code>, which is hidden unless you use some special CSS to do otherwise.

To define a visible anchor, use square brackets and two colons:

     [::MyVisibleAnchor]

When this anchor is rendered in the browser, it appears like this: [::MyVisibleAnchor].

**Note**: As of 2009-07-16, a visible anchor cannot start a page and be on a line with other text because of a bug in the Wiki engine.  As a workaround, either have a single newline after the anchor, or wrap the anchor in triple quotes as <code>'''[::MyVisibleAnchor]'''</code>.  The latter is sufficient since an alias that starts a page can and should have '''bold emphasis''' anyway.  Some visible anchors are acronyms or abbreviations for things about Emacs.  Consider putting them after the expanded phrase in parentheses.

You can link to a visible anchor as usual, just as if it were the name of a Wiki page: MyVisibleAnchor. If you are not using mixed uppper- and lowercase letters in your anchor, or if you need to include spaces, use double brackets around the link.

Example:

    [::Create a Visible Anchor]

The link would appear as follows:

[[Create a Visible Anchor]]

It should be formatted as:

   [[Create a Visible Anchor]]

Clicking the ''anchor definition'' itself runs a ''search for the anchor text'', just as if you had typed it into the '''Search''' field at the bottom of the page.

Some people use a visible anchor as an IRC nick on their page, eg. [[kensanata]] links
to the visible anchor ''kensanata'' on the page AlexSchroeder.

The name of a visible anchor must be unique throughout the wiki; unlike [[#HiddenAnchors]].

See [[Oddmuse:Permanent Anchors]] for the full story on visible anchors.
