== Prerequisites ==

You will need to install git.

There is a Debian package called <code>git-core</code> that you can
install if you use Debian or Ubuntu.  If you are using Windows, then
visit http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/.  Mac OS X users may
visit http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/.  Otherwise, visit
http://git.or.cz and download the latest source.

== Shared project repo  ==

If you are a developer that is part of the muse-el project at
http://repo.or.cz, you will want to do the following.

<pre>
git clone ssh://repo.or.cz/srv/git/muse-el.git muse
</pre>

If you wish to join the Muse development effort, then contact alexott
AT gmail.com in order to start the copyright assignment process, and
register with http://repo.or.cz (being sure to indicate your ssh
public key).

If you do not have developer access but wish to track the latest
development changes, do one of the following instead.  If you are
behind a restrictive firewall, use the second method; otherwise, use
the first method.

First:

<pre>
git clone git://repo.or.cz/muse-el.git muse
</pre>

Second:

<pre>
git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/muse-el.git muse
</pre>

== Picking a branch ==

To see a list of the available branches, run the following command in
the checked out copy of Muse.

<pre>
git branch -r
</pre>

Here is a description of the available branches.

|| <code>HEAD</code> || The branch you are currently on ||
|| <code>master</code> || Main development branch ||

If you want to browse the available branches via the web, visit
http://repo.or.cz/w/muse-el.git.

The default branch that you get when cloning the Muse project is
<code>master</code>.

To see which branch you are currently on, do:

<pre>
git branch
</pre>

To check out a branch, do the following.  This changes the contents of
the current directory to match that branch, rather than creating a new
directory.

<pre>
git checkout [branch name]
</pre>

For the shared branch, this would be the following.

<pre>
git checkout master
</pre>

== Using the archive ==

=== Keeping up-to-date ===

To keep up-to-date on the latest Muse happenings, run git's
<code>pull</code> command from the directory that contains your copy
of Muse.

<pre>
git pull origin
</pre>

The name <code>origin</code> refers to the place from which you
originally checked out the Muse project.

This will update Muse, taking care to preserve any changes that you
have checked in to your local copy.

=== Telling git your name ===

If you have made some changes that you would like to commit to the
Muse project, first you will need to provide a name and email address.
This information is used in the change log for each change you commit.
To do this, edit the <code>.gitconfig</code> file in your home
directory to include the following contents.

<pre>
[user]
        name = Your Name Goes Here
        email = you@yourdomain.example.com
</pre>

Now you are ready to make the change log, and then commit.  Read on
for the change log instructions before doing the commit.

=== Committing changes ===

If you wish to commit just a few files that you have changed, instead
of all the files that you have changed, then do the following.

<pre>
git add changed-file-1
git add changed-file-2
git commit
</pre>

If you instead wish to commit all changes in one go, then do:

<pre>
git commit -a
</pre>

In both cases, git will open an editor that you can use to make a log
message.  Add a brief one-line description of your changes at the top
of the file.

The rest of the file (keeping a blank line after the very first line)
is for describing your changes in detail.  If you want, you can either
leave this blank or just copy the relevant part of your ChangeLog
entry here.  The information you use here will appear in the
[https://mail.gna.org/listinfo/muse-el-logs/ muse-el-logs mailing list]
when you are done.

Make sure that you have described your changes in the ChangeLog file
before committing, or at minimum, use ChangeLog-style syntax in your
log entries (or something similar to it).

Here is one example of an acceptable commit log.

<pre>
colors: Fix issue with <lisp> tags too early in #title

* lisp/muse-colors.el: Split the muse-directive-or-comment property into
  two separate properties that are muse-directive and muse-comment.
  (muse-colors-region-end): Make buffer-local.
  (muse-colors-delayed-commands): New variable that contains a list of
  commands to run immediately after highlighting.  This is meant to allow
  highlighting functions to delay code until later.
  (muse-colors-region): Apply commands in muse-colors-delayed-commands.
  (muse-colors-inhibit-tags-in-directives): New variable that determines
  whether tags are allowed in directives.
  (muse-colors-custom-tags): Take muse-colors-inhibit-tags-in-directives
  into account.
  (muse-unhighlight-region): Remove muse-directive and muse-comment
  properties.
  (muse-colors-title): Modify muse-colors-delayed-commands.
  (muse-colors-title-lisp): New command that gets called after
  highlighting other things.  This interprets <lisp> tags, and is
  passed arguments specifying the beginning and end of the region.
  Thanks to <name of contributor> for the report.  The reason we want
  to do things this way is because this is the behavior we get already
  when publishing the page.

* lisp/muse.el (muse-goto-tag-end): Change to use muse-comment property
  rather than muse-directive-or-comment.
</pre>

=== Giving changes back ===

If you have changes that you have committed to Muse, they are only local
to your copy of Muse so far.  If you want to share them, you must either
push them back to the shared repo, or email them to the muse-el-discuss
AT gna.org mailing list.

If you have developer access to the shared archive, you can push
changes back by doing:

<pre>
git push origin
</pre>

If you do not yet have developer access, read on.

You may send your changes via email by doing:

<pre>
git format-patch -M origin
</pre>

and then sending the generated patch files to the muse-el-discuss
mailing list.  Be sure to describe your changes and include a sample
ChangeLog entry for them.  Be sure that the patch is the body of the
message, and not an attachment.  Any comments that you wish to make,
but don't want to appear in the commit log, should be placed between
the "<code>---</code>" and the diffstat.

If you want to send the resulting patches from the commandline, rather
than opening up an email client, you can do the following, where
PATCH-FILE is the file that <code>git format-patch</code> made:

<pre>
git send-email --to muse-el-discuss@gna.org PATCH-FILE
</pre>

== Becoming a Muse Developer ==

If you want commit access to the shared Muse repository, then register
an account at http://repo.or.cz (be sure to add an SSH key), and
contact the current maintainer at mwolson AT gnu.org.  It would be
best to send some patches to the muse-el-discuss AT gna.org
mailing list first, so that we know that you know what you are doing.

You must also be willing to sign a copyright assignment for your changes
to Muse, since Muse is a GNU project.  The current maintainer will
assist you in this process if you contact him.

== Emacs modes, Tutorials, and Documentation ==

DVC (see DistributedVersionControl) is a highly-recommended Emacs
add-on that allows you to see changes that you have made, log
messages, and (eventually) merging changes easily between branches.

Alternatively, the development version of Emacs should include some
regular VC bindings for git, so that you can use the same key-bindings
that you would use for CVS.

git's documentation may be browsed at [http://git.or.cz/ the git website].
There has been a significant effort since March 2007 to make the
documentation more thorough and easy to read.  Several tutorials are
there, as well as a User's Manual.
