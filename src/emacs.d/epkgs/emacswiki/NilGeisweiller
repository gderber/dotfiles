I am
* Emacstheist
* Emacstremist
* Devoted apostle of the church of Emacs

I practice
* Emacsditation
* Emacstrospection
* Sometimes but not often OEE (Out-of-Emacs Experience)

Some people are materialistic, some are idealistic, some even are dualistic, but only few are Emacstic, I am one of those.
