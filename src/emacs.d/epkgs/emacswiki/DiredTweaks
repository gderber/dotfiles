== Mode Description in XEmacs ==

In [[XEmacs]]'s dired mode, `C-h m' does not work the way it does in other modes.
not sure why.  In any case, I use this:

  (define-key dired-mode-map "\C-hm" 'dired-describe-mode)

It is not a perfect solution because it is not electric, but it works. -- gambarimasu who is at gmail
