== Wrap Region ==

Wrap Region is a minor mode that wraps regions with punctuations or tags. It can also be customized to insert the "right buddy" to a punctuation and place the cursor between them.

== Smartparens ==

Smartparens provides additional wrapping features, such as wrapping with multi-character pairs and with structured tags (html tags or latex begin/end blocks) where the content of opening pair is mirrored to the closing pair. It also properly handles delete selection modes. The package also provides many features unrelated to wrapping (but related to work with pairs).
