Emacs 內附有使用手冊 (tutorial)，用 <tt>C-h t</tt> 就可以讀了。
It will walk you step-by-step through an editing session in
which you will learn the basics of using Emacs as an editor.

Emacs 也附有完整的參考手冊 (manual)。The EmacsManual can be
accessed using the command <tt>info</tt> either in a shell window
under GNU and Unix operating systems, or in Emacs, by typing <tt>M-x
info RET</tt> (that's Meta- or ESC x, the word "info", followed by the
return key), or by typing <tt>C-h i</tt> (that's Control-h followed by
i).

If you wish to extend Emacs, you can do so using EmacsLisp, or Elisp
for short.  You can learn the basics of simple Elisp programming by
reading the EmacsLispIntro, and a complete reference manual for Elisp
is available in the EmacsLispReference.

Emacs comes with a file, refcard.tex (and refcard.ps in
<nowiki>PostScript</nowiki> format), which gives most of the
keybindings for basic editing.  Emacs is known as "the
self-documenting" editor, though, so while the refcard can be useful,
one should learn to rely on <code>info</code> or <code>C-h i</code>
for most of the more complicated features of this editor.  If you do
not have access to <nowiki>TeX</nowiki> or some sort of
<nowiki>PostScript</nowiki> interpreter like
<nowiki>GhostScript</nowiki>, then http://refcards.com/ has PDF
versions of this, XEmacs' card, and AdvancedDeskCalculator as well.

There is an online book called TheCraftOfTextEditing by CraigFinseth that describes how text editors work internally, and uses Emacs for many of its examples.
