sqled-mode is a major mode for editing (not executing) SQLPLUS, SQL
and PL/SQL code.

Download:

* Lisp:sqled-mode.el

Its main features are:

*  automatic (upper-)casing of keywords 
*  automatic indentation 
*  some functions that generate lists and "where" clauses from 
       the output of a sqlplus "describe table" command.

:      This probably requires some explanation:  the database I work with 
       makes a lot of use of compound keys, so I am frequently faced with 
       a table whose description from "describe table" looks like, say:

	   key_name1    NOT NULL CHAR(5)
	   key_name2    NOT NULL CHAR(5)
	   key_name3    NOT NULL CHAR(5)	
	   column_name1          INTEGER
	   column_name2          VARCHAR2(2000)


:      and I frequently need to generate a clause:

	   WHERE x.key_name1  = y.KEY_NAME1
	     AND x.key_name2  = y.KEY_NAME2
	     AND x.key_name3  = y.KEY_NAME3

:      or a list: key_name1,key_name2,key_name3,column_name1,column_name2
       
It has only been tested with Oracle, since thats the only database 
I have any experience with, and only under unix and linux.  
It was developed for use under X, with one sqlplus window and 
one emacs window open, allowing for cut-paste between the
two windows.

Yay! Yet another mode to test out for programming PL/SQL on Oracle... :) It'd be great if all these SQL/PL/SQL modes where merged in some way. Well, one can always dream... :) -- MaDa

I'm not a big friend of automatic capitalization...  I liked PlsqlMode and used it often when at work... -- AlexSchroeder
