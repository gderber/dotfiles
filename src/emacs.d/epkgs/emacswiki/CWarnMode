cwarn-mode is a minor mode that can highlight a few dangerous typos in C (or derived languages).

cwarn.el comes installed on Emacs.

By default it highlights:
* Semicolons right after conditions and loops (e.g.  <code>if (x == y);</code>)
* Assignments in tests (e.g. <code>if (x = y) {</code>)
* Functions with reference parameters (e.g. <code>void funct(string &p) {</code>)
