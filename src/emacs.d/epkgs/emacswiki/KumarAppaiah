Hi! I am a graduate student in Engineering, and I have been using GNU Emacs for several years now, though I consider my level far below that of a power user. Emacs is still an indispensable tool for me.

I have written a few simple modes, notably the bc-mode and a significant update to the muttrc-mode, both of which should be available from the ElispArea.

You can catch me on IRC (OFTC and Freenode) as [::kmap].
