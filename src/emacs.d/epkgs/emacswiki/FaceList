List [[face]]s using `M-x list-faces-display' and customize them by hitting
enter. This is a standard Emacs command.

== Alternatives ==

* Lisp:face-list.el -- Provides the hit-enter-to-customize behavior for Emacs 20. Not needed for Emacs 21 or later.

* Choose a face from a list with dynamic filtering (pattern matching).
** [[Anything]] -- `M-x anything-colors', narrow the face list by typing some patterns(multiple patterns are space-delimited string),
select with up/down/pgup/pgdown/C-p/C-n/C-v/M-v, choose with enter to customize selected face.
** [[Icicles]] -- Whenever you use a command that reads a face name (e.g. `set-face-foreground', `customize-face', `describe-face' etc.), you can complete against the name or its RGB values, or both. Match using multiple patterns, substrings, regexps, etc.)
