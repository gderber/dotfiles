Hi to all,

I greatly appreciate to use Emacs every day for a lot of things. You always have something to learn on the power of this software. 

Not an Emacs expert, and very little knowledge in Emacs Lisp, but I am learning slowly...

I just tried to make my first major mode (with only syntax highlighting, alpha version for the moment) for the textile markup language. See TextileMode.

I use EmacsMuse to maintain a small website with some Emacs related stuff at :

And I sometimes post some little things on Emacs and Gnus on my blog (in french) at :
