Emacs keeps track of files that you are currently editing by creating a symbolic link that looks like .#-emacsa08196. Unlike AutoSave files or BackupFiles, these cannot be moved to a different directory. You can disable them in Emacs versions >= 24.3 with the following configuration:

   (setq create-lockfiles nil)
