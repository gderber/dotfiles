: [...] one big advantage of working with wiki, warts and all, is
that it [a] does most of what we want fairly well [yes, it does have history ...
at least, wikipedia does], and [b] [all important!] it appears to be the leader
of the pack -- most-used, most-in-active-development of any of the products.
from a practical standpoint there is nothing worse than using some random
fly-by-night piece of software that we then have to maintain ourselves.
problems like difficulty in rearranging the structure beyond just one level will
probably be fixed in future releases of the wiki code.

: i would propose [a] using the emacs wiki, and [b] doing it incrementally.  start
with the to-do development projects i've been thinking of.  integrate docs
sitting in my machine and the [http://www.xemacs.org/Architecting-XEmacs/index.html Architecting-XEmacs] stuff.  then consider moving
the [http://www.xemacs.org/FAQ/index.html faq] over to wiki-land.  after that, think about whether or not it would make
sense to provide summaries of discussions and solutions reached, and what to do
more in general about the idea of a common fount of xemacs knowledge,
collaboratively maintained.
