ecmascript-mode is a basic major mode for editing code conforming to the ECMA-262 standard (3rd edition). The most notable languages           
employing all or most of the standard are JavaScript (Netscape), JScript (Microsoft), and !ActionScript (Macromedia).

ecmascript-mode provides only syntax highlighting and whatever facilities it inherits from java-mode--the mode from which it is derived.

This mode unconditionally makes <code>font-lock-builtin-face</code> bold. That isn't very friendy.

I'm not sure why I put that in there. :) I am an elisp newbie, and this was my first foray into programming a major mode. I will remove the offending line.
