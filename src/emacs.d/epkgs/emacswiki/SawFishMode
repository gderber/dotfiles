Sawfish is a window manager that can be extended using a Lisp dialect.  See ExtensibleSoftware and http://sawfish.wikia.com

[http://git.tuxfamily.org/sawfish/main.git?p=gitroot/sawfish/main.git;a=blob_plain;f=sawfish.el;hb=HEAD sawfish.el] provides a major mode "sawfish-mode" to edit Sawfish
source lisp files. There, you can use `C-x C-e' to run `sawfish-eval-last-sexp', just like `eval-last-sexp' of elisp modes.

From Sawfish-1.7.0, it is included in the Sawfish window manager, and
the above link points to the latest version. It was originally written
by Dave Pearson, but currently maintained by Sawfish community.

Example ~/.sawfish/rc can be like:

<pre>
(setq user-apps-menu
      '(("Terminal" (system "terminal &"))
	("Root" (system "root &"))
	("Emacs 20.7" (system "emacs-20.7 &"))
	("XEmacs 21.4" (system "xemacs-21.4.1 &"))
	("Netscape" (system "netscape &"))
	("Galeon" (system "galeon &"))
	("xchat" (system "xchat &"))
	("The GIMP" (system "gimp &"))
	("XFIG" (system "xfig &"))))
</pre>

Editing these lines and hitting `C-x C-e' I can change the apps-menu on the fly.
