My [http://jekor.com/emacs/dot-emacs.pdf .emacs] (literate PDF file).

I use Emacs.

== Road to Emacs ==

* started writing Common Lisp in 2006 and needed SLIME
* PDA died and needed a replacement PIM (found Org-mode)
* while working in network security, found that editing files on remote hosts with Tramp+ssh+Dired was much easier than ssh+bash+vi
* pushed through the discomfort and haven't looked back

Welcome to the wiki! I must confess that when I got started with Tramp, I got several weird lockups, and eventually I gave up. I should try it again. -- AlexSchroeder

I did as well. I found that I had to set the prompt pattern to be less restrictive:

##(setq tramp-default-method "ssh"
      tramp-shell-prompt-pattern "^[^#$>\n]*[#$%>)] *")##
