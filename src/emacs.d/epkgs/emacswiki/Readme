This page describes [[Readme.org]].






== Library Information ==
== Using org-readme ==
Org readme is used to:

* Create/Update a "History" section in the Readme.org based on the changelog
section of the Emacs Log.
* Create/Update a "Library Information" Section Based on the Emacs lisp header.
* Create/Update a "Possible Dependencies" Section Based on the Emacs
lisp header.

All other sections of the Readme.org are then put into the
"Commentary" section of the readme.org.

In addition this library defines <tt>org-readme-sync</tt>,  a convenience function that:

* Asks for a commentary about the library change.
* Syncs the Readme.org with the lisp file as described above.
* Updates emacswiki with the library description and the library itself.
* Updates the git repository with the differences that you posted.
