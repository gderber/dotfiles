Programmer at id Software

After trying many IDEs for my C/C++ hacking on Linux/OSX .. finally settled on Emacs.

I would really wish for better code browsing capabilities, and something that would come close to MSVC's intellisense. (Typically, the go to declaration / go to definition and autocompletion). Been using CScope so far ( CScopeAndEmacs )

If you want to reach me live, you can probably check for me as TTimo on irc.freenode.net ( US Time )
