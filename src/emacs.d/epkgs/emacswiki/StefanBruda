I use XEmacs.  I am in fact a big fan and a long time user.  I also hack elisp code now and then.  
Somehow major contributions include maintaining a quite complete PrologMode and an EmacsPilot 
synchronization suite.  Some other hacks of mine are at http://turing.ubishops.ca/home/bruda/xemacs-prog/.
