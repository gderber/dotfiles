My real name is Brian Langenberger and
I use Emacs in some form or another since 1993.
However, I've only really started to exploit its full potential
through customization in the past few years.
Once one starts down the road of creating and adapting
Emacs addons to make the editor better, it becomes difficult to stop.
So I've put together this homepage to share some of my
favorite tips and additions.

== Source control for .emacs.d ==

I use Git to manage my .emacs.d directory and most everything in it.
This allows me to try out new features without fear.
If new elisp code doesn't work out, I can easily revert any changes.
But in addition to Emacs code, I also store useful things like
monospace TrueType fonts and .screenrc files within that same directory.
Because I do work on many different machines, it's helpful to have an entire
development environment in one place under distributed source control.
That way if I need to start work using a new computer,
I'm just an Emacs install and "git clone" command away from
having the same environment I use everyplace else.
Or if I make changes on one machine, it's trivial to push
those changes out to all the others.
Whether on X11, Mac OS or Windows, Emacs looks and acts the same everywhere.

== Simple customizations ==

The real beauty of Emacs is the ease of creating labor-saving
modes and functions, some simple and some not.
For example, I was spending a lot of time adding \hyperref links
and \label anchors to LaTeX documents.
So rather than spend a lot of time doing that work by hand,
I took 15 minutes to create a function to do it for me:

    (defun mk-latex-ref (label)
      "Make LaTeX label or hyperref"

      (interactive "Mlabel:")
      (if mark-active
          (let* ((start (region-beginning))
                 (end (region-end))
                 (original-string (buffer-substring-no-properties start end)))
            (completion--replace
             start end (format "\\hyperref[%s]{%s}" label original-string)))
        (insert (format "\\label{%s}" label))))

I throw these little functions together all the time.
If it's something I can envision that's not already in the editor,
and someone hasn't already built it, it rarely takes much time
to program it myself.

== Favorite addons ==

; [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WindMove WindMove] and [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FrameMove FrameMove] : it's hard to overstate just how much easier these make navigation between windows and frames
; [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/OrgMode OrgMode] : helps keep my life organized
; [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EthanWhitespace EthanWhitespace] : keeps my source code clean without having to think about it
; [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HighlightSymbol HighlightSymbol] : invaluable for tracking variables, especially in dynamically-typed languages in which a typo might not show up until an error at runtime
; [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HighlightParentheses HighlightParentheses] and [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/joseph-autopair.el joseph-autopair] : work together to keep my parentheses balanced
; [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/multiple-line-edit.el multiple-line-edit] : comes in handy whenever I need to add prefixes or suffixes to lots of text
; [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/iflipb iflipb] : provides an excellent analogue for browser-style ctrl-pgup/ctrl-pgdown tab switching
; [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/volatile-highlights.el volatile-highlights] : means I never have to guess where my pasted code has gone, or which line I've jumped to
; [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColorThemeZenburn Zenburn] and [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PowerLine PowerLine] : combine to make Emacs look very slick
; [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SmartTabs SmartTabs] : a very helpful way of tab indenting code that degrades gracefully

I've tweaked some of these to work together in a way I prefer,
and I'm always on the lookout for new bits to assimilate
into my own configuration.
