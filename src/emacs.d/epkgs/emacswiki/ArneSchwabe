Yet another Emacs user

: Welcome! -- AlexSchroeder

: If you are, in fact, a GNU Emacs user you should use the phrase, "I use emacs" somewhere on the page so that [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?search=%5Cbuses%3F%5Cs%2Bemacs%5Cb%28.%7C%5Cn%29%2ACategoryHomepage Emacs users] or [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?search=%5Cbuses%3F%5Cs%2Bxemacs%5Cb%28.%7C%5Cn%29%2ACategoryHomepage XEmacs users] will pick it up -- DougAlcorn

: Hi, Arne! You added a wishlist to erc-bugs about table completion on /t. Have you had a chance to use C-c C-t or /appendtopic before? --DamienElmes

Since you put "I use use emacs" on my pages this search now finds me :)
