IrcClientSurvey says how I produced the list. Plus some manual editing to restore some of the stranger replies. :)

Irssi and [[ERC]] continue dominating the list. Where is X-Chat!? I continue to think that irssi remains popular because people keep it running inside GNU screen sessions. We never learn anything new from these lists!

Strange, the [[rcirc]] clients didn't respond to the CTCP request sent to the channel.

(And where's Rockers Client?  I'm still using that. -- RandalSchwartz)
