One of the major obstacles to completing the next major release of GnuEmacs is updating the copyright years.  RichardStallman posted[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2005-10/msg01738.html] to the [[emacs-devel]] mailing list recently to reiterate the same request that was made mid-year[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2004-06/msg00863.html].
Based on new legal advice[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2005-07/msg00862.html], the interpretation[http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/emacs/emacs/admin/notes/years?rev=1.4] of updating the years in copyright headers is much easier for the developers compared to the old interpretation.  Copyright updates can now legally be left to automated software like CopyrightUpdate.

If the release isn't made by the end of the year, all the copyrights will have to be updated again in lieu of the release.[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2005-07/msg01370.html].
