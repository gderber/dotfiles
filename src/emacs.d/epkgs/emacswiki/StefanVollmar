We use Trolltech's Qt framework to develop software for MS Windows, !MacOS X, Linux and Solaris. These days it is mostly C++ and Python. We have actively supported Aquamacs, http://aquamacs.org; for software development we now prefer !QtCreator, but for all other editing I am happy to stick with Emacs. I have just discovered Org-mode and hope this is going to change my life...
