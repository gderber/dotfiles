This is an eshell extension to facilitate directory switching.

* Lisp:eshell-autojump.el

Use `j' to list your favorite directories (as determined by your usage of `cd').
Use `j regexp' to jump to your most favorite directory matching the regular expression.

The list of directories is based on `eshell-last-dir-ring' which gets saved in ##~/.eshell/lastdir##.
You can increase the ring size by setting `eshell-last-dir-ring-size'.

Note that the *standard eshell comes with a very similar mechanism* based on the same ring of directories:

: To view the ring: `cd ='
: Changing to an index within the ring: `cd -4'
: Note that `cd -' is the same as `cd -0'
: Use a regular expression: `cd =regexp'

The only benefit autojump offers is that it sorts the entries by /how often/ you switched there instead of /when/ you switched there.
Perhaps this is good enough for you, making autojump unnecessary.
