Emacs is a powerful tool for refactoring source code and working with programming language code generally.  It provides a generic and programmable platform for modifying text files with extensions for working with a variety of programming languages.  Here are some packages that make Emacs even more useful for refactoring.

How does this relate to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refactoring refactoring]?  What does refactoring "browser" even mean?  If someone can add something relevant here, please do.  Otherwise this page should probably be deleted.

I agree, there's nothing in the line of Smalltalk's Refactoring Browser or explicitely relating to refactoring in those links...
Although if there was I'd be very interested. -- SebastienRoccaSerra

If someone has an emacs tool that will go through a set of C files and headers, determining which functions and variables are no longer being called please mention it on this page. gcc does this for variables within a function, but not for a set of interrelated files. -- LV

I would think that would be either a GCC trick with some shell programming, or a perhaps there's a hack possible with EmacsTags. -- AaronHawley

This page doesn't provide enough information about how it relates to refactoring. This needs more information or should be deleted. -- PraveenKumar

In response to LV: rtags does this.
