[http://code.google.com/p/picasm picasm] is a little assembler development environment for [http://www.microchip.com Microchip]'s PIC series of microcontrollers. At present it supports the PIC10, PIC12 and PIC16 instruction sets. Feature list:

* Indentation
* Syntax highlighting
* Bundled chip database
* Assembler/Linker support for GNU [http://gputils.sourceforge.net gputils] (gpasm) as well as Microchip's MPASM
* Programmer support for the pk2cmd program
* Delay loop calculation
* "Electric" comment key

picasm is at release 1.1 and still probably has bugs, but is under active development. Comments (and patches!) welcome.
