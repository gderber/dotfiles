This offers you an add on package for Emacs including BDF fonts, a new
input method, and the option of saving your files for
<nowiki>TeX</nowiki>.

Follow the manual for the installation.  I found it unproblematic.

== NT Emacs ==

I'll have to check...  Creating the fontsets and using the BDF fonts
works when you follow the NT Emacs FAQ to the point.  No idea about
cgreek, though.

== TeX, LaTeX ==

Your files will be saved in the Ibycus4 style.

That means, you will have to get Ibycus4 as well.  You can find it on
any CTAN (http://www.ctan.org/) or Sunsite mirror in the .../language/greek/ibygrk
subdirectory.

Installing this might be difficult for non-<nowiki>TeXies</nowiki>.
So here goes for owners of the <nowiki>TeTeX</nowiki> distribution.

* Unpack it.
* You'll find four directories in ibycus4.
* Copy their contents recursively to /usr/local/share/texmf/.

If you are using stow:

* Unpack the stuff in /usr/local/stow.
* mkdir -p ibycus/share/texmf
* mv ibycus4/* ibycus/share/texmf
* rmdir ibycus4
* stow ibycus

Now verify that you have it installed in the correct places:

* ls /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/generic/ibycus4/*.sty

This should at least list ibycus4.sty.  When you have that,
rebuild ls-R:

* mktexlsr

If you want a little test file, take this one:

 \documentclass{letter}
 \usepackage{ibycus4}
 \begin{document}
 \begin{letter}{Test}

 This is a test.

 \end{letter}
 \end{document}

When you compile it using `C-c C-f' (this runs the command `tex-file'),
you should see no errors and some output like this:

 Document Class: letter 1999/04/29 v1.2z Standard <nowiki>LaTeX</nowiki> document class
 (/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/size10.clo))
 (/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/generic/ibycus4/ibycus4.sty
 (/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/generic/ibycus4/ibycus4.map
 . . .

Done!

== ConTeXt ==

With the ancientgreek module, ConTeXt can process Unicode Greek input. I use the carbon (OS X) version of emacs (22.0.96.1), and I found it easy to write and display Unicode polytonic Greek. 

=== Writing polytonic Greek in Unicode ===

The most convenient method is greek-babel. Type ##C-\## When you're prompted for an Input method, type ##greek-babel##. This will allow you to type the same keystrokes as if you were inputting the babel transliteration, but emacs will translate them to the corresponding Unicode glyphs. Very neat!

=== Displaying polytonic Greek ===

This is code that I picked up here on the wiki. I like a very large font so I can recline in my chair while typing; just adapt the size if you like something smaller. It works on my copmuter: OS X 10.4.9, with the Gentium fonts installed. YMMV:

<pre>
(create-fontset-from-fontset-spec
   "-apple-andale mono-medium-r-normal--24-*-*-*-m-*-fontset-andale,
     ascii:-apple-andale mono-medium-r-normal--24-*-*-*-m-*-mac-roman" t 'noerror)
(set-frame-font "-apple-andale mono-medium-r-normal--24-*-*-*-m-*-fontset-andale" 'keep)

(set-fontset-font "fontset-andale"
		  (cons (decode-char 'ucs #x0374)
			(decode-char 'ucs #x03fb))
		  "-apple-gentiumalt-medium-r-normal--24-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1")

(set-fontset-font "fontset-andale"
		  (cons (decode-char 'ucs #x1f00)
			(decode-char 'ucs #x1fef))
		  "-apple-gentiumalt-medium-r-normal--24-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1")
</pre>

==  Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) ==

Some more TLG related stuff (cgreek already contains some of that).
