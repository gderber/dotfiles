This is about making wiki documentation from Elisp.

== What is it? ==

WikiDoc is an Elisp file that you can load into Emacs and will let you make a buffer of Wiki output from function documentation. 

It is very much a work in progress but it does make [[Creole]] pages from Elisp function documentation.

== Why? ==

Emacs has GNU Info documentation. It's very good. But it is a bit laborious to make web pages from. You end up with a lot of artifacts left over in the page which are intended for print, or a lot of structure that you don't particularly want. 

A lot of Wiki languages now have good tools for turning them into HTML in a variety of situations. A bit easier to build a website from than Info.

In addition, the Info generators are expensive and quite opaque. Not easy to read or alter.


== Get it ==

The Elisp is available [[wikidoc.el|here]].

It's also in [[http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/wikidoc|marmalade]].

== Using it ==

Load wikidoc.el into Emacs and then:

{{{
M-x wikidoc-insert
}}}

You will have to enter a prefix for documentation to generate. This is an Elisp name prefix, such as:

{{{
wikidoc
}}}

to generate all of wikidoc's documentation.
