It's quite easy to configure outline minor mode (see OutlineMode) with some customization to show/hide bodies of functions, class definitions, etc. in code.

Here's the .emacs to set it up for Python and PHP.  This rebinds C-arrows and M-arrows to do basic folding/unfolding and navigation of the outline structure.  Class and function definition lines are marked as outline headers, using indentation to determine level.  

The only 'gotcha' with this setup is that code immediately following a function/class definition, but outside of it, will still be gobbled up by OutlineMode as part of the preceding section, until the next function/class definition is found.  Occasionally this might actually be appropriate - most places it is not.  One hack-around is to stick in a comment beginning with '#head' and mark such lines also as outline headers.

You can use outline-magic to fold python code: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4079648/combine-python-mode-with-org-mode-for-emacs/4093889#4093889 python-magic.el].  Then you can just use tab to cycle through folding levels.  Agree with the hack using comment headers.  Except its better than a hack because you can use any comment as a header: [https://github.com/tinku99/python-magic/raw/master/sample.py sample.py].   -- Naveen Garg
