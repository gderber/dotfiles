I mostly use Cygwin Emacs these days, and occasionally emacsformacosx. In past I have used Cygwin XEmacs, NTEmacs and Emacs on various *nix OS. I have been using Emacs off and on -- mostly on -- since 1993. I have never contributed anything.

The only place I write anything these days that's publicly viewable is at [http://stackoverflow.com/users/18573/miserable-variable stackoverflow]
