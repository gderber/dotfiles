I've noticed that since the last upgrade, we seem to have a problem.
About once a day, the wiki is locked.  If you notice it, please
take a look at UnlockWiki and see how to unlock the site.

I'm also interested in any suspicions you might have.  :)

I don't have an answer, but it has been much more than once a day. I've unlocked it several times in the past two days. -- DrewAdams

I suspect a cronjob, but I don't have access to my email right now.  :(

I think it happens once an hour at 36 minutes past the hour.  Sounds like a cronjob to me.  -- AlexSchroeder
