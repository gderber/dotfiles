Using sshfs with Emacs generally works great.

But sometimes emacs can produce 10s timeouts every 20s or so.
This is due to a bug in emacs, fixed in the repository as of Jan 2009.
The bug is in lisp/jit-lock.el, so you can patch it easily without recompiling.
I encountered this in Aquamacs 1.9.

(This should perhaps be added to a faq - finding the patch above is not easy. 
Also there are a lot of solutions floating around that suggest writing backup files
to a local disk, instead of pointing to the above problem)
