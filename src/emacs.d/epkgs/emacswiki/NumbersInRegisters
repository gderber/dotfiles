Registers are useful tools when writing KeyboardMacros.
Notice how you can store numbers in registers, insert them again, and increment them in the register.

See the Node /Keeping Numbers in Registers/ in the EmacsManual.

Example session:

; `C-u 1000 C-x r n x': Store 1000 in register x
; `##C-x (##': Start a keyboard macro
; `C-x r i x': Insert the number in register x into the buffer
; `##C-x r + x##': Increment the number by one
; `##<end> <newline>##: Do something else
; `##C-x )##': End keyboard macro definition

Now run `C-u 50 C-x e' to run the macro 50 times.

See IncrementNumber, ReplaceRegexp, ReplaceCount or RenumberList for alternative that don't involve registers.
