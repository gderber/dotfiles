<include gist "https://gist.github.com/4700573">

Can also be found in the [[Elnode]] repository on [[http://github.com/nicferrier/elnode|GitHub]].

In development but NicFerrier says there are a few good use cases:

* add the handler to your existing [[Elnode]] site for automatic js debugging
* use an [[Elnode]] proxy to jack anything into any site
