<code>html-coding.el</code> is a spot of code to select an Emacs
coding system from the <code><meta></code> tag in a
<code>.html</code>, <code>.shtml</code> or <code>.htm</code> file.

This is designed for Emacs 21.   Emacs 22 already has this feature, so nothing is done there.

Very likely the heavy duty HTML editing/browsing packages have this or
something similar.  <code>html-coding.el</code> is designed merely to
get the right characters when doing a FindFile on a
saved HTML page, or a page you're editing with plain HtmlMode.

Version 4 and up is implemented by <code>defadvice</code> (see AdvisingFunctions) on <code>set-auto-coding</code>, to let it work with ArchiveMode on files from a zip file etc.
