Hi All,

I applied the solution reported in section number 3 stock emacs. I created a .gpg file, I opened it with emacs-24.2-18.fc18.x86_64 on a fedora 18.

- emacs reports the following message after password insertion: "Package pgg-gpg is obsolete!"
- I edited the decrypted file
- When I save it emacs told me: "Symbol's value as variable is void: pgg-text-mode" and forced me to quit without saving the file content

Do you have a solution?
An updated version of code to insert in init.el file exist?

Thanks a lot,   Armando

The solution for emacs-24.2-18 is to add the following line in init.el:

(auto-encryption-mode 1)

Thanks to help-gnu-emacs@gnu.org

Cheers,  Armando
