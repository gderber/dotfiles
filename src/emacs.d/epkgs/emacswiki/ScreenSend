= screensend.el =

Simple Emacs script to allow you to send selected blocks of text to a
running screen or tmux session. This is useful for sending text to interactive
programs like clojure, psql, etc. in cases where the built-in term-mode is
too slow.

== Usage: ==

    ; for screen
    (require 'screensend)
    (global-set-key [f4] 'screen-select)
    (global-set-key [f5] 'screen-send)
  
    ; for tmux
    (require 'screensend)
    (global-set-key [f4] 'tmux-select)
    (global-set-key [f5] 'tmux-send)

Start a screen session:

    screen -S mysession

Or if you're using tmux:
  
    tmux new-session -s mysession

Now press F4 and select "mysession"

Now either select some text or place the cursor in between a text paragraph 
and hit F5.

The selected text is transmitted to the screen session.
