Analogous to MoveLine, for a curious person on the EmacsChannel wondering about moving the [[region]] along with the text.

If you want a function that does MoveLine and MoveRegion similar to Eclipse's Alt-Up/Down (i.e. determining whether to move lines or regions) then you need MoveLineRegion or the [https://github.com/targzeta/move-lines move-lines] package that moves indifferently current line or lines surrounding region.

{{{
(defun move-region (start end n)
  "Move the current region up or down by N lines."
  (interactive "r\np")
  (let ((line-text (delete-and-extract-region start end)))
    (forward-line n)
    (let ((start (point)))
      (insert line-text)
      (setq deactivate-mark nil)
      (set-mark start))))

(defun move-region-up (start end n)
  "Move the current line up by N lines."
  (interactive "r\np")
  (move-region start end (if (null n) -1 (- n))))

(defun move-region-down (start end n)
  "Move the current line down by N lines."
  (interactive "r\np")
  (move-region start end (if (null n) 1 n)))

(global-set-key (kbd "M-<up>") 'move-region-up)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-<down>") 'move-region-down)
}}}

See also standard command `transpose-sexps', bount to `C-M-t'. It doesn't move the region, but you can use it to move a [[sexp]] around. A [[prefix argument]] determines the direction of movement. -- DrewAdams
