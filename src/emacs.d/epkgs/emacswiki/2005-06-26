As for the SiteMap spam, how about this: I lock the SiteMap, but symlink it to another page called RealSiteMap.  If bots of humans looking for a page with high Google pagerank try to edit SiteMap, it will not work.  Anybody else can just edit RealSiteMap.

If it works (prevents SPAM) and people are aware of how to change SiteMap, I think it is worth trying.

Instead of using symlinks on the filesystem, I've used the page transclusion feature Oddmuse provides.   I hope it is good enough to fool the uneducated spammers.  All we need to do now is document this somewhere...
