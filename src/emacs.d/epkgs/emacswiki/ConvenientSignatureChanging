This function inserts a new signature on <code>C-c C-w</code>.

If there already is one it is correctly removed before the new is inserted.

<pre>
    ;; insert signature, delete previous, if existing
    (defun bhaak-signature-change()
      "Replace signature with new one"
      (interactive)
      (save-excursion
        (when (message-goto-signature)
          (if message-signature-insert-empty-line
              (forward-line -2) (forward-line -1)))
        (delete-region (point) (point-max))
        (message-insert-signature)))

    (define-key message-mode-map "\C-c\C-w" 'bhaak-signature-change)
</pre>

What I like to do is to have [[Fortune]] give me a nice signature when I start gnus. So I've got this in my .gnus.el file:

<pre>
(add-hook 'gnus-startup-hook 'fortune-to-signature)
(add-hook 'message-setup-hook 'fortune-to-signature)
</pre>

This causes gnus, on start, to create a signature from [[Fortune]]. This signature will then be inserted into the first message I send. The second part causes it to create a /new/ signature from fortune when I start composing my first message. This new signature will be automagically inserted into the /second/ message I send. Very nifty.
