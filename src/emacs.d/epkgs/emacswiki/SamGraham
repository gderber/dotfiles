I'm Sam Graham, a professional web-developer in various languages and, unsurprisingly given the site you're reading this on, a long-time Emacs user.

I'm also known as [::Illusori] in various places, you can check out my [https://github.com/illusori GitHub page] which includes a mix of Elisp, Perl, PHP and Javascript projects.
