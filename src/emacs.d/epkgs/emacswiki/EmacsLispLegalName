We often use Elisp and EmacsLisp interchangeably to refer to EmacsLisp. Is this ok?

== Emacs Lisp vs. elisp ==

It seems that "elisp" is not a good name for Emacs Lisp.  When asked,

 "Elisp" was a trademark in the 80s, for CCA Emacs.
 I am pretty sure it is long dead.
 But we can ask a lawyer to check.
 Eben, can you please check?

Should we prefer "Emacs Lisp" in the EmacsWiki, or is "elisp" ok? -- [[Lars Brinkhoff]]

I looked in the official online database of the US trademarks office ( http://www.uspto.gov/ ) and received no results for "elisp", I personally think it requires less energy than emacslisp. Writing it e-lisp or e.lisp or e/lisp would emphasise that it is an abbreviation. [[Zeth]]

I guess we should use Emacs Lisp.  The EmacsManual doesn't use elisp, either, except when linking to the EmacsLispManual.

 "Elisp" is not presently a registered trademark in the US for any
 software-related line of commerce.  A company called Elispot had marks
 for laboratory sensing and measurement equipment consisting of the
 word "Elisp" without graphic, but those marks appear to have been
 abandoned at the end of 2000.  There is no current record of an
 "Elisp" mark related to any version of Emacs.

Elisp seems fine.  You aren't trying to sell a product and, as mentioned above by Zeth and Eben's post, there is no trademark registered in the USA for elisp. Even if there were, I highly doubt that informal conversation and notes on a web site (this one) would be enough to be considered infringing use. Then again, [WikiPedia:IANAL IANAL] but Eben is. -- MattPerry
