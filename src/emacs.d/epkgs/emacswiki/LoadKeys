If you want to change to keys on the Linux console, read the following manpages on your system:

* dumpkeys -- dump keyboard translation tables, use the -l option to obtain the complete list
* showkey -- examine the scan codes and keycodes sent by the keyboard
* loadkeys -- load keyboard translation tables
* keymaps -- keyboard table descriptions for loadkeys and dumpkeys

Use dumpkeys to get the current configuration.  This will also show
you what kind of things are possible with the Linux kernel's keyboard
driver.  Use showkey to find out, what a single key does.  And use
loadkeys to load a new configuration.  See MissingKeys for an example.
