I use Emacs. ... except for mailing with mutt. In that case (typically in a Putty terminal) I use vi.
Okay, sometimes I have emacs running in that putty session and read the mails with ansi-term mode and mutt.
In this case my editor is emacsclient. Though I am still curious what will happen if vi opens in an
ansi-term buffer. The 5 things that keep me with emacs are:

* OrgMode: Plans, notes, time tracking, trouble tickets, spreadsheet ...
* SqlMode in particular and ComintMode in general
* Completion and ''real'' history with Ctrl-r, M-r in ComintMode
  (I don't use bash in win32, so emacs is the only way to get the incremental search through the history)
* VersionControl: Used to start with RCS with VC, changed to cvs with pcl-cvs and more often also to psvn
* Writing source code

I never got into Mail with Gnus. And also the other MUAs (Mew, VM, Wanderlust) didn't suite me,
so I just stick with ''mutt'' ("the one that sucks less").
