I use Emacs

Nothing of great significance to offer.  However, I have solved a few problems along the lines of headache relief.

hm...

Can't figure out how to create a new page.  Presumably the following belongs within CategoryXML or CategoryHypermedia. Perhaps a kind soul will explain.

Just got to CategoryHypermedia, edit it, add your new page name to the
page, save it.  Now CategoryHypermedia will have your new page name
with a questionmark after it, because the new page does not exist,
yet.  Klick on the questionmark and you will edit the new page.  When
you save it, the page will be created.  Thanks for contributing.  --
