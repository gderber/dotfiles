I wonder whether we can use the [[Brutalist Theme]] to do this. I like how Gergely Nagy created his dark theme (see [https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon/brutalist-theme.el/src/branch/master/brutalist-dark-theme.el#L46 brutalist-theme.el]) using variables.

Probably. I've been looking at Brutalist Theme too, because I like how much it achieves with a small number of colors and styles.
