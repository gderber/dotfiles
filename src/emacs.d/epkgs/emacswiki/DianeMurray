My name is Diane Murray, and I use Emacs.  I subscribe to the motto "Never
leave Emacs", using other programs only when absolutely necessary.

== Life inside Emacs ==

Whenever Emacs is on I have [[ERC]] connected to irc.freenode.net, where you
can find me idling on a few Emacs-related channels: #emacs (EmacsChannel),
#erc, and #muse.

[[Rmail]] is my main email reader; I use Gnus nnimap (CategoryGnus) on my
laptop.

OrgMode keeps track of all my task lists.  I find it extremely useful to
switch back and forth between EmacsMuse and OrgMode when editing longer texts,
where OrgMode lets me get a good overview of things and provides quick
navigation between sections.

I use [[EMMS]].  I'm very interested in [[GNEVE]] and [[etracker]], though I
haven't tried them out yet.

I don't suffer from RepeatedStrainInjury like many others, but I get problems
with my eyes after working extended periods of time at the computer.  Whenever
my eyes bother me too much, I need to spend time away from the computer.  I'm
still looking to find the best color scheme, font, and font size.

One of the most important things I have in my ##.emacs## is:

    ;; prevent accidentally killing emacs (seen on emacs-devel mailing list)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-c") 'nil)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-c C-x") 'save-buffers-kill-emacs)

== My EmacsWiki habits ==

I check
[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/?action=rc;days=1;all=1;showedit=1
RecentChanges showing all changes including minor edits] less times each day,
but I still show some symptoms of a RecentChangesJunkie ;).  I also have the
odd habit of visiting this site's
[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?action=random random page] over and
over every once in a while.  I've set keybindings to visit each of these
pages.

Wow, Rmail!  :) -- AlexSchroeder

Diane, I was looking through http://identi.ca/disumu and noticed you tease that you will some day release a development version of an otherwise clandestine web browser - I can't wait to see the first release! -- PatrickAnderson
