Thanks, I was just going to program this myself.

However, the regexp for the connect-string is too weak.
# There may be leading blanks
# You can use "conn" "Conne" "Connec" and "connect"
# The username can be much more than just a-z_. I added numbers but that's still not all (can be quoted)
# The password is more complicated
# All, username, passord and database my be omitted and and interactively entered.

I use this, but it is still not perfect:
{{{
(when  (string-match "^ *conn\\(e\\(c\\(t\\)?\\)?\\)? +\\([a-z0-9_]+\\)\\(/[^@]+\\)?@\\([a-z0-9_]+\\)" line)
	(setq sql-user (match-string 4 line)
	      sql-password (match-string 5 line)
	      sql-database (match-string 6 line)
}}}
