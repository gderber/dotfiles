If you crosspost articles from Usenet or mailing lists to the wiki, please ask the
original author whether they are willing to license their text under
our licensing terms (see footer) or release it into the public
domain.

== Remove Mail Addresses ==

Remove email adresses from any material you post and transform the
original name into a link to their homepage on this wiki.  If people
want to reveal their email addresses on their homepage, fine.
Example: Alex Schroeder <alex@some.adress.com> turns into
AlexSchroeder.

Remove email addresses even if you are copying an interesting article
from a newsgroup.  Remove email addresses even from source code
comments.  Provide enough headers such that interested parties can use
search engines such as http://groups.google.com to determine the email
address of the original address (I suggest the name of the author,
subject, newsgroups, and date) (I suggest including the Message-ID --
[[Lars Brinkhoff]]).

Leave email addresses for mailing lists.
