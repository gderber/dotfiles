Hello World!

I am an Emacs newbie primary interested in python-mode, gnus and org-mode for now.
I hope I will be more useful to this wiki as my emacs expertise increases.

Also, if you want to add greek pages to the wiki, I can help set up the necessary infrastructure. Start with TranslationHelp. :) -- AlexSchroeder
