This page is about Info mode (`C-h i'), a major mode for reading hypertext manuals. In particular, the EmacsManual is available in Emacs as an Info manual, providing SelfDocumentation.

== Common Info Commands ==

Here are some common Info commands. Use `C-h m' in an Info buffer to learn more. You can also read the Info manual about Info (!). It includes a tutorial about Info.

* `i' -- Search through the manual's indexes for a regexp

* `s' (also `C-s' or `C-M-s' in Emacs 22) -- Search for a string or regexp
* `g' -- Go to a node by name
* `m' -- Choose a menu item

Suppose you want to read an Info manual that is not in your InfoPath -- file ##miscpackage.info## in the current directory, for instance.  Here are several ways to do that -- the first is generally the easiest:

* `C-u C-h i'

* `##C-x C-f miscpackage.info M-x Info-on-current-buffer##'

* `##C-x C-f miscpackage.info M-: (Info-mode)##'

* Use DiredMode (munge keybinding to taste) -- `dired-x' does this automatically.

    (define-key dired-mode-map "I"
      (lambda () (interactive)
	(info (dired-get-filename))))


== Enhancements to Info ==

* InfoPlus -- New info commands, key bindings, font-locking, and menus.

: I notice that this has the command `Info-merge-subnodes', which can put all nodes related to something into a single page.  This is my fondest wish for info: to have everything on one page so that I can just navigate normally without the hierarchy.  (Strange, isn't it?)  -- [[Gambarimasu]]

: Yes, and you can also use it to create Info buffers of just certain (multi-node) parts of a manual. Wrt navigating, you might also be interested in the next item below: using '''Icicles''' as an Info browser. -- DrewAdams

* [[Icicles - Info Enhancements]] -- Use '''Icicles''' [[regexp]] [[completion]] and [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]] with Info [[multi-command]]s (`g', `i') -- browse among the hits. Create virtual manuals as arbitrary node sets. Use [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview|Icicles search]] with Info.
* InfoApropos -- Search indexes of all info documents on the system.
* InfoLook -- Lookup symbols or files in info indexes.
* InfoToWiki -- Converting Info to Wiki output one GNU manual at a time. 
* InfoIndexDefaultEntry -- Make the Info-index ("i") command default to looking up the word at point.
* [[Iman]] -- Completion for InfoManuals and ManPages when running InfoMode and ManMode.

== Use with Anything ==
[[Anything]] is a candidate selection framework.

Start with M-x anything-info-at-point, narrow the list by typing some patterns(multiple patterns are space-delimited string),
select with up/down/pgup/pgdown/C-p/C-n/C-v/M-v, choose with enter,
With C-z description of selected symbol are displayed without quitting anything session.
