My name is Chris Done and I use Emacs for editing HTML, XSL/XML, Emacs Lisp, Haskell, C#, JavaScript, CSS, VBScript and configuration files. I also use it for writing documents with org-mode.

What font is that you're using in the [LinumGap line numbers screenshot]?

It's just Deja Vu Sans Mono, the standard Gnome-terminal font on ubuntu.

I tried your align-by-current-symbol, but emacs 23.1 complains, that the function align-string is unknown. 
I searched around a bit, but couldn't find a definition anywhere. Which additional package do I need to use your
extension?
