There's a very interesting thread going on on [[emacs-devel]] on the subject of
"enriched-mode and switching major modes" -- mostly it was about moving towards
true word-processing.  OliverScholz is trying to push for a statement of intent
towards a sophisticated model such as the block-model used for cascading style
sheets, which includes things as tables where cells have different font-sizes.
Those who know the Emacs display engine will know that while font-size may
vary on a line, a line is still a line, so Emacs currently cannot display two
table cells where the first cell has two lines in a big font and the second cell
has three lines in a small font, and no extra whitespace in either cell.

RichardStallman is trying to figure out what kind of changes Oliver is arguing,
defending the current mechanism as far as possible.  KimStorm as author of
CuaMode also has some things to add.  So all in all a great read.  ;)
