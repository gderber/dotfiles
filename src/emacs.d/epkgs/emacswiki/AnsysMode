The project supports your workflows with the FEA (Finite Element Analysis) suite
[http://www.ansys.com ANSYS] (ANalysis SYStem, registered TM). The code is hosted on [https://github.com/dieter-wilhelm/ansys-mode GitHub].
The latest stable version you'll find on [https://github.com/dieter-wilhelm/ansys-mode/releases GitHub's ANSYS-Mode releases page] or at [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bxnk08BGWfexUThqbWxLX1NyeTg Google's ANSYS-Mode drive].

ANSYS-Mode is an add-on to the [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs GNU Emacs editor] for
investigating and coding APDL (Ansys Parametric Design Language).  The
mode offers also managing and communication capabilities for various
ANSYS processes, like interactive code debugging with the solver or
inquiring the license manager status, etc.  Some features are quite
sophisticated but its documentation is targeted for ANSYS users with
little Emacs experience.

Advantages compared to other APDL editors: Largest feature set, user
extensible, cost-free, Emacs integrated tools, available for all OS,
for in-built help no ANSYS installation necessary.

The complete online documentation you'll find [http://dieter-wilhelm.github.io/ansys-mode/ here].
