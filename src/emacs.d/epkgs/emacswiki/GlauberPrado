I live in Brazil, with a son and a woman.

My interests are computers, robots, nature, and sports like surfing and skating.

I am learning EmacsLisp and CommonLisp and [[Scheme]].  Emacs is a really nice platform to learn these things that's why my interest is in it.  I also do some computer graphics related stuff with software like Blender and Wings and someday i want to hack on it but i dont know C or CPlusPlus enough to do it and Scheme/[[Lisp]] is not so hard with begginers.  So i am here to learn basically, and also for customizing emacs to be more helpfull in accomplishing these tasks.

Peace,

I think somebody assumed you were a spammer because you only linked to your Web site that contained nothing.  We're happy you persevered and started your page again here.   Welcome!  -- AaronHawley
