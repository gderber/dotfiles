The [::auto-coding-alist] variable is an AssociationList that associates an encoding with a regexp pattern to match a file's full path, similar to AutoModeAlist.

Each element looks like <code>(REGEXP . CODING-SYSTEM)</code>.
A file whose name matches <code>REGEXP</code> is decoded by <code>CODING-SYSTEM</code> on reading. The settings in this alist take priority over `coding:' tags
in the file (see the function `set-auto-coding')
and the contents of `file-coding-system-alist'.
