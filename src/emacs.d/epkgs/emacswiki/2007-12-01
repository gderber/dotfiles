[http://groups.google.com/group/gnu.emacs.sources/msg/a188ece1a448b031 Deleting Emacs support for obsolete platforms] -- Emacs 23 will support fewer platforms!

If you use Emacs on an obscure platform, now's the time to speak up.

As for me, I haven't even heard of 98% of these platforms. :) -- AlexSchroeder

That's because you're just a young whippersnapper!  :) 

To be fair, I've only heard of most of these from compiling GNU software back in the early nineties and having to read through a bunch of stuff to figure out which headers to use. (Hurrah for auto*!)  But my first Unix account was on a Gould (also my first exposure to Emacs!), my first SA job was on Sun3s, and a coworker hauled some Apollo Domain workstations out of a dumpster in '95.  Ah, well, time marches on....
