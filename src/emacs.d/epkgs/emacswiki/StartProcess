After wasting a lot of time head-scratching and swearing I discovered: *start-process* needs *default-directory* to be set to a directory that exists.

Eg
<pre>
    (setq default-directory "@")
    (start-process "ls" nil "ls")
</pre>
will produce the error "(wrong-type-argument stringp nil)"

Sounds like a bug; please report it!

This doesn't sound like a bug to me. On POSIX systems (so far as I understand things), processes have to be started within some working directory. `default-directory' simply is the working directory of the current buffer, so if it's set to a non-existent path, what's the exec call to do?
