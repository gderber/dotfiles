Hi, as an Emacs fanatic and Debian developer, I worked on several packages :

* GuessLang

* Egocentric, which highlights occurences of your name in buffers (i.e. Gnus article buffers)

* Pong, an elisp implementation of Pong !

* Fortune, a fortune database management package

* Workbone, a CD control package, with CDDB interface

* others various code snippets

All of these packages should be available at http://www.grassouille.org/emacs/index.en.html

You can find me on OPN IRC on various channels (#emacs, #april, #debian-devel) as benj, which is my usual nickname.
