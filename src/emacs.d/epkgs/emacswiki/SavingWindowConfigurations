While [[Registers|registers]] are powerful tools to save available [[WindowConfiguration]]s and [[FrameConfiguration]]s (See [[FramesAndRegisters|Frames & Registers]] for details.), unfortunately there isn't an easy way to serialize these configuration objects asis for persistency. (In the time of this writing, neither ##desktop.el##, nor ##session.el## were supporting this feature either.) To solve this serialization problem, people tend to follow below steps.

# Extract frame, window & buffer configurations from currently visible display.
# Save these variables in a readable way. (E.g. Using s-expressions.)
# In later sessions, using saved configuration variables, create/open related frames, windows, and buffers from scratch.

For instance, see [[http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Enxhtml/nxhtml/main/annotate/head%3A/util/winsav.el|winsav.el]] of [[NxhtmlMode|nXhtml]] for a complete window configuration saving system using above mentioned steps to supply desired persistence.

Alternatively, here are some ad-hoc dirty implementations for some basic tasks.

  (defun gnus-register-window-configuration ()
    "Register a whole `*Group*' buffer window into configuration 1."
    (let ((group-buf (get-buffer "*Group*")))
      (when group-buf
        (switch-to-buffer group-buf)
        (delete-other-windows)
        (beginning-of-buffer)
        (window-configuration-to-register ?1))))
  
  (add-hook 'gnus-started-hook 'gnus-register-window-configuration)
  
  (defun erc-register-window-configuration ()
    "Register vertically split `#postgresql' and `#lisp' channel windows into
  configuration 2."
    (let ((psql-buf (get-buffer "#postgresql"))
          (lisp-buf (get-buffer "#lisp")))
      (when (and psql-buf lisp-buf)
        (switch-to-buffer psql-buf)
        (delete-other-windows)
        (recenter)
        (select-window (split-window-horizontally))
        (switch-to-buffer lisp-buf)
        (recenter)
        (window-configuration-to-register ?2))))
  
  (add-hook 'erc-join-hook 'erc-register-window-configuration)
