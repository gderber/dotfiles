There are several todo modes out there.  Click on the header to search
for all pages related to todo lists.

* TodoMode by OliverSeidel -- has integration with the Emacs Calendar/Diary stuff
* SideBrain -- a tool for programmers: it maintains a stack of your current tasks, and a queue or pool of pending tasks, and a set of observations
* OutlineMode is just that -- a mode for expanding and collapsing parts of a document; might serve as a very primitive TODO list
* OrgMode extends OutlineMode and provides very nice facilities for TODO and other sorts of lists, including integration with the calendar/diary, a table editor, and exporting the list in various formats (html, ascii text).
* ToDoo by DanielLundin -- simple and based on outline-mode
* ToDo by ChristianQueinnec --  perform actions based on scripts or mail
* TodoGnus -- implemented as Gnus backends, therefore use the same interface as a newsgroup where every article is a todo item
* BugTrack -- has an RMAIL-like interface and some RMAIL integration
* RecordsMode -- lets you keep a diary and also provides support for todo items.
* PlannerMode -- this is more like a PersonalInformationManager (PIM), but can serve as a complex todo mode.
* RkTodo -- very simple todo sorter function (I use it within EmacsWikiMode files)
* EtaskMode -- project tasks, Gantt charts, LaTeX output
* [[Taskjuggler]] -- A project management tool
* TodoListMode -- Provides color highlighting for a numbered todo list file.
* [https://github.com/0x4b/org-camp/ org-camp] --  ***Appears to have been deleted*** Provides functions to import Basecamp todo items into org-mode 
* [http://www.datenterrorist.de/index.php?itemid=1437 TODO comment buffer] -- Get a buffer with all TODO, FIXME and XXX comments and their filenames
* TodoStack -- a stack as a todo list.  Don't laugh.  Once you get used to it, it can have its uses.
* TodoTxtMode -- major mode for editing (an extension of) the todo.txt format.
* DoListMode -- major mode for editing a todo list, based on org-mode but an alternative approach.
