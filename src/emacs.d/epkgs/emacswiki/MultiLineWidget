All text widgets are multiline, however you have to type C-j to add
new lines, as <RET> is bound to "activate button"...

You just have to rebind <RET> to its original meaning
inside the field by overwriting the :action attribute.

 (define-widget 'multiline-text 'text
   "Text field spanning multiple lines."
   :action (lambda (&rest ignore)  
            (call-interactively
             (lookup-key widget-global-map (this-command-keys)))))

 (widget-create 'multiline-text :value "\n\n\n\n")

 (widget-setup)
