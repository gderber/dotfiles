NOTE: this page appears to be out of date.  There appears to be a well-developed catalog in erc.el

At some point in development, I decided to implement a catalog
system for ERC much like the one zenirc uses.

Basically, you can have multiple catalogs where each defines messages for
certain events.

Here is an example on how to create a catalog:

 (erc-define-catalog
  'english
  '((ACTION . "* %n %a")
    (INVITE . "%n (%u@%h) invites you to channel %c")
    (JOIN   . "%n (%u@%h) has joined channel %c")
    (JOIN-you . "You have joined channel %c")
    (MODE   . "%n (%u@%h) has changed mode for %t to %m")
    (NICK   . "%n (%u@%h) is now known as %N")
    (NICK-you . "Your new nickname is %N")
    (PART   . erc-message-english-PART)
    (QUIT   . "%n (%u@%h) has quit: %r")
    (TOPIC  . "%n (%u@%h) has set the topic for %c: \"%T\"")
    (s004   . "%s %v %U %C")
    (s221   . "User modes for %n: %m")))

Every catalog entry can either have a string which format specifiers in it,
or a symbol which names a function to call. The function gets called
with the format specifiers as arguments. See `erc-message-english-PART'
for an example on how to handle this.

= Customizing messages =

To redefine messages, you can do something like this:

 (erc-define-catalog-entry 'english 'JOIN  "%n has joined channel %c")
 (erc-define-catalog-entry 'english 'NICK  "%n is now known as %N")
 (erc-define-catalog-entry 'english 'QUIT  "%n has quit: %r")
 (erc-define-catalog-entry 'english 'TOPIC "%n has set the topic for %c: \"%T\"")

= Notes =

There is only one catalog defined for now. The english catalog. When the conversion is finished, we
can start buidling alternative catalogs, or find friendly translators.

= Discussion =
Random idea: If we once have multiple language catalogs, we could utilize something
like auto-lang-mode to automatically determine a channels language
and switch to the right catalog if available.

Heh, this is cool.  Now ERC can be like google and support "languages" like Sweedish-chef or Elmer Fudd. :) -- MarioLang

I wrote some times ago, a french catalog. I am not using it since it is pain to have it working. I mean I have problems to automatically have it set in place of the english catalog. Maybe someone can help me fix that and then I will post the catalog. -- XavierMaillard
