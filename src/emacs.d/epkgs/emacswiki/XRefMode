This has *nothing* to do with "xref: A Refactoring Browser for Emacs"
mentioned on CategoryProgrammerUtils.

To quote from the website:

"This is nothing to do with the HTML or the world wide web; it allows
you to make links between and within any of your own files from within
Emacs with just a couple of keystrokes. The links are remembered in
such a way that your original files are not altered (or you can have
the links simply appended to the file for portability). Works best
under a windowing system --- any windowing system will do, as long as
your Emacs supports it."

This can also be used as a text marker mode, see TextMarker.
