== About Me and This Page ==

This is the page for Baoqiu Cui.  I use Emacs now but have used both
Emacs and XEmacs in the past: started with Emacs many years ago,
switched to XEmacs while XEmacs was having more features than Emacs,
stayed with XEmacs for many years, but finally switched back to Emacs in
2008.

I started using Emacs in 1995, and I got addicted to it very
quickly.  Nowadays I find it very hard to use any computer that does not
have Emacs installed. :-) Many thanks to all the people who contributed
/ are contributing to Emacs (many of them can be found on EmacsWiki), my
daily life and work becomes very interesting.

Almost everything I regularly do on a computer is done in Emacs:

* programming (for //all// kinds of programming languages)
* authoring (LaTeX, DocBook, HTML, XML, plain text, etc.)
* reading documents (Texinfo, man pages, PDF files, etc.)
* using version controls (RCS, CVS, SVN, GIT, CMVC)
* reading/composing emails
* taking notes
* spell checking
* grammar checking
* calculation
* looking up words in dictionaries
* managing TODO lists
* managing file systems
* managing address book
* IRC
* IM
* reading newsgroups
* browsing webs
* twittering
* playing games (sometimes :-) )
* editing this and other EmacsWiki pages using Yaoddmuse 
* ...

To me, Emacs is the editor for programmers; whatever you want to do on
a computer (i.e. in Emacs), you can always write or modify some existing
Emacs Lisp code to make it happen.  For most of the times, what you want
to do is already done by someone somewhere on the internet.  Thanks to
EmacsWiki, searching for the things you need becomes very convenient.

I hope I can share things that are worth sharing with people.  Comments
and feedbacks are welcome.

Thanks for the wonderful work of EmacsWiki, AlexSchroeder!  -- BaoqiuCui

Welcome to the wiki! I think grammar checking is one area Emacs has no good solution and your project can be a valuable addition to Emacs. Have you considered posting your project info to emacs-devel and ask for their comments to include it when it's matured? -- [[Leo]]

[new]
Thanks for the comments!  I am planning to post a message on emacs-devel
and/or comp.emacs to get people's input once this project gets more
matured.  (Thought that EmacsWiki is a better place to get some early
comments... and turned out I was right. ;-) ) -- BaoqiuCui

Both the DocBook exporter and the grammar checker integration looks like nice ideas to me.
I would like to export from org-mode to OpenOffice and perhaps I can do that via the DocBook exporter.
Are the tags you use for the exporter within those support by OpenOffice?
(There is a link to those on http://wiki.docbook.org/topic/OpenOffice)

Thanks for the comments...  however I don't know if there is a good and
up-to-date solution to convert DocBook V5.0 documents to OpenOffice.
All the solutions mentioned in the above link, including docbook2odf,
are old and I don't think they an handle latest DocBook V5.0. --

Thanks, but could you please explain why you think the old solutions would not work?
They are supposed to handle a subset of DocBook tags if I understand it correctly.
Would not that work now too?

[new:BaoqiuCui:2010-06-24 05:55 UTC]
This is because DocBook 5.0 and 4.x are not compatible.  The current
known solutions only work with DocBook 4.x.  Even though most of the
elements supported by DocBook Exporter of Org-mode are not changed much
from 4.x to 5.0, the old solutions still need to be modified to convert
DocBook 5.0 documents to OpenOffice.  -- BaoqiuCui

Just want say thanks for grammar-mode -- Although sometimes I don't
know what it is complaining about it is extremely helpful for a
non-native English speaker.  At least it makes me think whether or not a
sentence is proper or not.

First of all, thank you for your work. To me, Emacs is the editor for everybody.
I am a student of literature and I do all my work on Emacs23.
I could not install grammar-mode, a message says: Enabling Grammar mode gave an error.
Could you provide a step by step description in order to install grammar-mode?
I tried to do this: 1) Copy grammar.el and grammar.cc in my /.emacs.d 2)Then I include this: (require 'grammar) in my /.emacs -- Alfredo

[new]
Here is my install procedure:
* install the packages liblink-grammar4-dev and link-grammar
* locate the file link-includes.h (for me in /usr/include/link-grammar/)
* dowload the files grammar.el grammar.cc and Makefile and modify the Makefile (for me INCDIRS = -I. -I/usr/include/link-grammar/)
* execute the command make in the repertory where all the files are
* put the repertory where you did make into your path (eg export PATH=$PATH:/home/jm/grammar )
* I wanted to add this mode to the org-mode so I added
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook
    (function (lambda ()
       (load-file "/home/jarbona/grammar/grammar.el")
       (grammar-mode)
       )))
to my .emacs

By the way I have a lot of grammar timeout. Is it because my grammar is really to bad or is there a parameter to change?
