A SpreadSheet mode by FrankRitter (frank.ritter @ psu.edu):

* http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/dismal.html

The introduction warns against bugs and missing features, but this is
certainly the one which has been around the longest.  It is no
longer in hugely active development, but I (FER, 29/dec/08) am still around to answer questions.
There is a manual and some example uses of it have been published in conferences and also in a journal.  It is also part of the Emacspeak (audio interface) desktop
http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/applications.html

You would be very welcome to merge it with another spreadsheet, or take over development.
