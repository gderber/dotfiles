== About ==

I'm a professional software engineer with a passion for UNIX and its descendants, Emacs and free software in general. I live and work in Sofia, Bulgaria and I teach free programming and Linux courses in the universities there in my spare time. 
I also happen to develop a couple of small OSS projects and contribute to a bunch more. I usually hang around #emacs on freenode if you need to contact me - my nicknames happens to be *bozhidar*.

== Emacs ==

I happen to maintain a few Emacs related project on GitHub:

** [http://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-prelude Emacs Prelude]
** [http://github.com/bbatsov/projectile projectile]
** [http://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs The Zenburn color theme, ported to Emacs]
** [http://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs The Solarized color theme, ported to Emacs]

I'm also part of the team of the other Emacs Wiki - [http://wikemacs.org WikEmacs].
