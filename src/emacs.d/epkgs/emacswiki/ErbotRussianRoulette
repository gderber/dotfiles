ErBot has, built-in, Russian Roulette!

The simple version just involves pointing the gnu at your head and either letting it go *CLICK* or go *BANG*.  To do this, use the <tt>russian-roulette</tt>, <tt>RR</tt>, or <tt>rr</tt> commands (they're all the same).

Or you can bet on it.

First, you must get someone to give you some money.

Then use:

<tt>, bet OUTCOME AMOUNT</tt>

<tt>OUTCOME</tt> should be one of the symbols <tt>bang</tt>, <tt>bullet</tt>, or <tt>blam</tt> (to bet on the next chamber containing a bullet); or <tt>empty</tt>, <tt>no-bullet</tt>, or <tt>click</tt>.

<tt>AMOUNT</tt> should be some non-negative number, greater than the amount of money you have.

When the next person points the gnu at their head and pulls the trigger, the bot will distribute out the results of the bet.

If the person who pointed the gnu be shot, then all their money gets distributed (regardless of whether they bet or not).

To see how much money you currently have, use the <tt>money</tt> command.

To lend  <tt>X</tt> GEMs (Generic Emacs Monetary units) to <tt>PERSON</tt>, use:

<tt>, lend PERSON X</tt>
