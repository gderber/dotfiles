To get through reading the Emacs manual, you could make Emacs turn the pages in the InfoManual for you.

  (defvar words-/-second (/ 400 60.0))
  
  (defun speed-read-the-manual ()
    (interactive)
    ;; Turn page only if in Info manual.
    (if (and (not (interactive-p))
             (eq major-mode 'Info-mode))
        (Info-scroll-up))
    (let* ((words-/-window (save-window-excursion
                             (or (eq major-mode 'Info-mode)
                                 (info))
                             (count-matches "\\sw+"
                                            (window-start)
                                            ;; Info buffers need 2 args
                                            ;; for window-end strangeness.
                                            (window-end (selected-window)
                                                        t))))
           (seconds (/ words-/-window
                       words-/-second)))
      ;; Safety:
      (if (< seconds 2)
          (setq seconds 2))
      (message "Auto-scrolling the manual again in %d seconds"
               seconds)
      ;; Long-range recursion:
      (run-with-timer seconds nil 'speed-read-the-manual)))
  
  (defun stop-speed-reading-the-manual ()
    (interactive)
    (cancel-function-timers 'speed-read-the-manual))
