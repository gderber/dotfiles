==About me==

Hello my name is Matthew Ozor and I'm a AutoLISP programmer from Wilmington, Delaware, USA. 

== Contact me==

* IRC: !OzOr on irc.freenode.net

* Mail: matthew dot ozor at gmail dot com

== Init File==

* MatthewOzorDotEmacs is the InitFile that I use on multiple work stations. It can be used on both GNU/Linux and Windows.

== Elisp Libraries==

These are projects that I have created or actively work on.

* Lisp:mo-rot13.el creates new menu items and new commands to convert text to and from ROT13 encoding.
* [[Nav]] Emacs-nav is a navigation mode that includes a file manager, buffer browser and tags browser.

[new]
I made some friendly edits to mo-rot13.el.  I hope they are helpful.  If not, you are welcome to revert them.  I couldn't figure out what the `menu-bar-encode-menu' was?  I couldn't find a reference to it.  I only have access to Emacs 22, currently. -- AaronHawley
