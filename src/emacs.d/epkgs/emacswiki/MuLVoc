[[es:MulVocEs]]
MuLVoc is a MUlti-Lingual VOCabulary system, that manages a table of translations of words. It lives at http://mulvoc.sourceforge.net/, and was started by JohnSturdy. Its vocabulary tables are a bit confused at the moment, so don't believe all its translations for now!

In normal use, it pops up tooltips (or uses the minibuffer, or overlays) to display translations of words as you type them. It's intended as a vocabulary learning aid for language enthusiasts, and does not attempt to be a translator!

The documentation in Spanish can be found, both in HTML, Info and PDF at
