This is for development of a PlannerMode mobile interface, for uses on devices like the OpenMoko Neo FreeRunner.

The basic idea is to load a separate library, planner-mobile.el, which would make the necessary changes to the interface.

== Tool bar ==

A tool-bar with key icons would go a long way.

* What is an appropriate default tool-bar height and icon size?
* How many icons do we have room for?
* What are the key functions that need to be there?

=== Possible icons ===
  
* Previous day
* Next day
* Mark task done
* Mark task cancelled
* Delete task
* Follow link
* Create task 
* Save
* Jump to date
