If you use `M-x bs-show' as an alternative for (see BufferSelection),
you might want to add a configuration for [[rcirc]] buffers.

[[image:rcirc for bs-show screenshot]]

== Code ==

<pre>
(add-to-list 'bs-configurations
      '("rcirc" nil nil nil
        (lambda (buf)
          (with-current-buffer buf
            (not (eq major-mode 'rcirc-mode))))
        rcirc-sort-buffers))

(defun rcirc-sort-name (buf)
  "Return server process and buffer name as a string."
  (with-current-buffer buf
    (downcase (concat (if rcirc-server-buffer
			  (buffer-name rcirc-server-buffer)
			" ")
		      " "
		      (or rcirc-target "")))))

(defun rcirc-sort-buffers (a b)
  "Sort buffers A and B using `rcirc-sort-name'."
  (string< (rcirc-sort-name a)
	   (rcirc-sort-name b)))
</pre>

To always use the rcirc configuration in rcirc buffers, add this snippet:

<pre>
(add-hook 'rcirc-mode-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    (define-key rcirc-mode-map (kbd "C-x C-b")
	      (lambda ()
		(interactive)
		(bs--show-with-configuration "rcirc")))))
</pre>
