* Original author of the ps-print package.
* Author and maintainer of the j-shell mode for running shells within Emacs (like shell, comint, and eshell). /Code coming soon to EmacsWiki./
* Author of many other miscellaneous bits of elisp. /Soon to be posted here in case anyone else might find them useful./

I use XEmacs, but I'm in the process of switching to Emacs.
