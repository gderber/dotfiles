Building CygWin Emacs as opposed to the Win32 flavor -- fails with a message to the effect that Emacs hasn't yet been ported to Cygwin.  I appreciate the clean failure, but it's somewhat baffling since Cygwin already comes with a perfectly nice Emacs binary.  I assume the maintainer of that binary has patches that get it building, but they haven't yet been integrated into the mainstream.
