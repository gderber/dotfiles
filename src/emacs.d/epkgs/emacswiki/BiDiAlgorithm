This page describes an elisp implementation of the bidi algorithm described in UAX#9.
As Emacs already supports bidirectional display out of the box, this code is simply for educational use. 

----

The implementation supports implicit bidirectionality. The
implicit bidirectional algorithm and the directional marks RLM and LRM
are supported.  Full bidirectionality would entail the implicit
bidirectional algorithm, the implicit directional marks, and the
explicit directional embedding codes: RLM, LRM, LRE, RLE, LRO, RLO,
PDF.

The implementation can transform logical to
visual order and back.  The visual to logical transformation may be
usefull to convert text from the clipboard, assuming that other
applications put text in visual order into the clipboard.

* Lisp:bidi.el.gz

The bidi code needs BiDiTables that classify characters according to
the bidi types used in the Unicode Tech Report.
