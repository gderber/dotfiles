= SCPaste =

SCPaste is a simple tool to post the contents of a buffer to a public place.

It uses htmlize to convert font-lock coloring to HTML and then
copies the file via SCP. See https://p.hagelb.org.

A version using tramp-mode is available here:
https://github.com/metaperl/scpaste/blob/master/scpaste.el#L90

It does completely work, but I have no desire to continue with scpaste because it lacks line numbers for files.

Hi, you may be interested in using TrampMode for dealing with transport (and generalizing it). For example, something like 
<code>(htmlize-file "~/.emacs" "/ssh:host:dotemacs.html")</code> would not be that far from what you're doing.

You might consider using HtmlFontify which can take care of a bit more fontification than [[Htmlize]].
HtmlFontify will hopefully also be part of GNU Emacs soon.

YannHodique: of course; why didn't I think of that? Then we get Windows compatibility for free. I will also check out HtmlFontify; if that's going to be included in Emacs then it makes sense to incorporate it. Thanks!

scpaste 0.5 now uses htmlfontify. I have tramp turned off because it
was interfering with some basic Emacs operations at some point, but
perhaps that bug has been fixed; would be happy to see a patch that
switches to using tramp rather than shelling out.
