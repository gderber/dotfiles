[http://code.google.com/p/codesearch/ Codesearch] is a source code indexing system, similar to ctags, based on the now-defunct Google Code Search. It is designed to handle huge code bases with very high performance. See this [http://github.com/junkblocker/codesearch fork] for an actively maintained version of it.

[https://github.com/abingham/codesearch.el Codesearch.el] allows you to interact with codesearch from emacs. In particular, it lets you search an index with a regular expression and select from the matches in a results buffer. It works with both versions by allowing you to configure custom flags used.
