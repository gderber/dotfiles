As I wrote on [[2004-08-11]], I changed the RSS feed.
I think it has been working very well, so I replaced the
link target of the XML picture above with the new feed.
If you want the diff together with the page content,
then use the diff=1 parameter:

If you want more than the default of 15 entries, use the rsslimit
parameter.  If you use rsslimit=all, then you will get the entries
for the last seven days.  That is a /huge/ feed, so better use
days=3 or so to limit it.
