I've used this before, and it is very useful, but stopped because file access became unbearably slow. --PatrickAnderson

Also note the package seems to be no longer maintained. [http://www.chezmarshall.freeserve.co.uk/elisp/vcvss.html]

Documentation is scarce. I did this to get something working:

* ss.exe must be in emacs exec-path
* mount a drive to the vss server
* use the example setup below
* use vc-vss-change-database to point to your personal ss.ini file in the vss repos
* visit a file with emacs that you have previously checked out with vss. you should get basic vc functionality
* there is a check in the code for if a dir contains mssccprj.scc or vssver.scc files. You might want to add
checks for vssver2.scc files there as well, depending on your vss version.

One problem I've found is with files that are not version controlled within a dir that has version control enabled otherwise.

== Example Setup ==

<pre>
;; example setup
(require 'vc-vss)

(setq
;; not sure what to set vc-vss-path to...
;      vc-vss-path "//sourcesafe/someDatabase/users/you/ss.ini"
;      vc-vss-path "c:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/VSS/srcsafe.ini"
;      vc-vss-user "username,password"
	  vc-default-back-end 'VSS
; 	  diff-switches "-DV"
	  vc-vss-open-async t
	  vc-vss-open-async-rw t)

(add-to-list 'exec-path
			 "c:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/VSS/Win32")

(add-to-list 'vc-handled-backends 'VSS)

;; optional: these may be needed if you are not "logging into the domain"
(setenv "SSDIR" "\\\\sourcesafe\\someDatabase") ;directory of the ss.ini for that database
(getenv "PATH")
(setenv "SSUSER" "username") ;without domain
(setenv "SSPWD" "password")
