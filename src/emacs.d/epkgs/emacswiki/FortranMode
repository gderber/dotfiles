One of the ProgrammingModes that comes with Emacs supports Fortran.

There's a section of the EmacsManual specifically documenting how to use it.

A newer mode for editing free-format code is [[F90Mode]].  It also comes with Emacs.

Use `f90-mode' by adding the following to your InitFile.

    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.f\\'" . f90-mode))

Information on configuring these modes is also in the manual.  Also read the commentary at the top of the EmacsLisp source of these libraries to see more details, ##M-x find-library RET fortran RET## or ##M-x find-library RET f90 RET##.

[new]
Add-to list may not be necessary since Emacs normally uses Fortran-mode for files with extensions "f", "F", "for" â€˜and F90-mode for files with extensions "f90", "f95", "f03", "f08". See the [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Fortran.html|GNU Fortran manual] for more information. -ColinBaxter
