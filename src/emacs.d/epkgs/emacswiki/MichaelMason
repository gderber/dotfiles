I use GNU Emacs, currently version 22.2, on Microsoft Windows.  I've been using Emacs since version 19 -- or possibly 18 -- and it's slowly come to be the piece of software I spend most of my time using.

I work as an I T Manager at a small manufacturing company just outside Cambridge in England.  At work I use Emacs outline mode for keeping track of what I'm supposed to be doing, a hacked-up version of PatThoyts""'s unibasic.el to write programs for our mvBASE system, html-helper-mode for documenting the programs, and occasionally AUCTeX, usually when I get browned off with using Word.
