This package implements a simple minor mode that enables occurrences of your name (or other arbitrary text) to be highlighted in the current buffer.

By default your full name, your login name, your e-mail address and your last and first name individually are highlighted.  You can alter this behavior by setting the superego-regexp variable (either in your .emacs or via M-x customize-variable).

Emacs lisp code: Lisp:superego.el

== Usage ==

Make sure to load superego in your .emacs or have it auto-loaded on request:

     (autoload 'superego-mode "/path/to/superego.el" nil t)

Then for each mode you want, add a line like the following:

     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'superego-mode)
     (add-hook 'rmail-mode-hook 'superego-mode)

You can also enable the mode interactively in a specific buffer, via M-x superego-mode.

From the user standpoint this file differs from egocentric (written by BenjaminDrieu) mainly
in that it makes use of FontLockMode, with which egocentric does not
always seem to cooperate well. --MicheleBini
