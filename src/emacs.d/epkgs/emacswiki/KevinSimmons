I use EMACS but I am an EMACS newbie. After twelve years, I'm fairly proficient at vi and look forward to learning the richness of emacs. No worthy init file yet.

One thing I'd like to try in emacs: I use vim to open a gnupg encrypted file with folding enabled to store secret information. The folding is handy so that I can open the file with someone looking over-my-shoulder without revealing any sensitive information. When I close the file it is re-encrypted. There is no backup or file created while editing, its all in memory only while decrypted.
