I'm a computing scientist interested in programming languages, theory of computation, secure algorithms, and digital typesetting.  I work for !TrustBearer Labs, a multifactor authentication software shop.  I've been using GNU Emacs since Fall 2003 when I started at Purdue and was exposed to Unix for the first time (specifically, Solaris).  I know enough now to do quite a bit, as Emacs is my preferred time sink when I'm bored and have nothing else to do, but there's still plenty I've yet to learn.

My website is at http://real.metasyntax.net:2357/ and since I'm one of those guys that tries to do *everything* in Emacs, I've collected some [http://metasyntax.net/guides/emacs.html tips, tricks, and howtos] from my various Emacs adventures.

I go by [::metasyntax] on IRC, usually !FreeNode.
