= About =

This is a proof-of-concept to see how adding file properties in the form of "tags" and "comments" to files from Emacs, could work. The ideas are borrowed from the tag support in [[Tumme]] and a recent discussion in gnu.emacs.help made me hack this together.

The functionality is still quite limited but I will hopefully add more useful features to it. Feedback is appreciated.

Here is the code:

Lisp:file-props.el

= Installation =

Place the source file in your `load-path'.

Put the following in your .emacs file:

 (require 'file-props)

If you want to activate display of comment and tags for Dired, put
this in your .emacs as well:

 (file-props-dired-activate-display)

To setup convenient Dired keybindings, put this:

 (file-props-dired-setup-keybindings)

= Usage =

== Adding tags ==

In dired, mark a couple of files and type

 M-x file-props-dired-add-tags RET.

There are three ways to enter tags. The default is to separate multiple tags with a comma. You can customize how to enter tags with the option `file-props-read-tag-multi-method'.

You can add tags to the currently open file:

 M-x file-props-add-tags-to-current-file RET

Enter tags in the same way as described above.

You can also add a comment to the files by doing this:

 M-x file-props-dired-add-comment RET

== Finding files ==

Type 

 M-x file-props-find-tags-dired RET.

Enter a tag and type RET.

You will be presented with a dired buffer containing the files
having the tag you searched for. The default directory for the Dired buffer will be the same that was set when you executed the command.

== Edit properties ==

Since version 0.1.2 there is a new mode for editing both comment and tags. Mark a number of files in Dired and execute `file-props-dired-edit' and you will be presented with a buffer where you can edit the data.
