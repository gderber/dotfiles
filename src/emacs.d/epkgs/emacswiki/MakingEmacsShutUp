== Making Emacs Shut Up ==

There are a number of commands that as a safety feature prompt the user before continuing.  These prompts can be an annoyance to an experienced user who might prefer to live dangerously. This is a place to list ways of silencing some of these prompts. 

* Copying directories using Dired without "Recursive copies of --" question:

   (setq dired-recursive-copies 'always)

* Delete directories recursively without asking:

   (setq dired-recursive-deletes 'always)

* Alternately, ask only at the top level, before deleting a tree:

   (setq dired-recursive-deletes 'top)
