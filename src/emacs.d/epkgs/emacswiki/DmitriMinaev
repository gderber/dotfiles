Linux systems administrator in Samara, Russia. Specializing in: !MySQL, Nginx, php-fpm, Memcache, !RabbitMQ.

Use Emacsen since around 1997. A bit proud of my tiny contributions in Org-mode.

The Emacs modes which I use every day (and sometimes at night) are Org-mode and html-helper-mode.

Emacs is especially good when used with the window manager StumpWM.
