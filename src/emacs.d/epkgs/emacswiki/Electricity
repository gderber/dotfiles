The use of "electric" in Emacs is based upon alternative uses of the
English word that have evolved over time, at least in the U.S.  These are
derived from personal experiences with using electricity.  For example, a
U.S. English dictionary lists both "electrifying" and "thrilling" as
definitions for "electric".  Typical usage might be:  "The lion act at the
circus was electric.  I sat on the edge of my seat the entire time!"   So,
when someone describes a mode or a function in Emacs as "electric", they
are claiming you will be thrilled or electrified by some of its features.

Electric modes tend to do some things "automagically" and/or very
cleverly for the user.  The electric features are typically
continuously active while the MajorMode is active, taking control of
things, monitoring and reacting to every input the user makes.  Often,
electric modes and functions require fewer keystrokes from the user to
navigate and to enter data.  Sometimes the behavior is "cool",
"clever", "seems like magic", and/or is "just really convenient".  You
may or may not like what an electric mode or an electric function does
while it is active but, whatever it does, it shouldn't be routine.  It
should deliver some sort of "Gee Wiz!" behavior.

Examples include certain printing characters in CcMode which after
being inserted also indent the current line and/or insert a newline,
the ElectricBufferList, and ElectricPair.

== Code example ==

This is used in SqlMode.  If a user presses `;' and the variable
<code>sql-electric-stuff</code> is set to the symbol `semicolon', then
the input is sent via comint to a process.

    (defun sql-magic-semicolon (arg)
      "Insert semicolon and call `comint-send-input'.
    `sql-electric-stuff' must be the symbol `semicolon'."
      (interactive "P")
      (self-insert-command (prefix-numeric-value arg))
      (if (equal sql-electric-stuff 'semicolon)
          (comint-send-input)))
