I discovered the joy of XEmacs at a Java based software company around 2002. It wasn't until some years later that I switched to GNU Emacs, mainly because it could run SLIME without problems.

I'd like to see Lisp and its communities grow and modernise. Can't wait for lexbind to get integrated someday, and maybe an FFI...
