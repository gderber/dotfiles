[new:PascalHaakmat:2017-01-02 19:07 UTC]

Since July 2016 bbdb 3 has integrated support for Wanderlust which seems to mostly supersede this package. It can be enabled using:

<pre>
(require 'bbdb) 
(bbdb-initialize 'wl)
(bbdb-mua-auto-update-init 'wl)
</pre>

The default binding to complete addresses is <code>M-<tab></code> or <code>M-;</code>. To use a single TAB I use the following Elisp:

<pre>
(defun my-bbdb-complete-mail ()
  "If on a header field, calls `bbdb-complete-mail' to complete the name."
  (interactive)
  (when (< (point)
           (save-excursion
             (goto-char (point-min))
             (search-forward (concat "\n" mail-header-separator "\n") nil 0)
             (point)))
    (bbdb-complete-mail)))

;; Use TAB to complete names
(add-hook 'wl-mail-setup-hook
          (function
           (lambda ()
             (define-key (current-local-map) (kbd "<tab>") 'my-bbdb-complete-mail))))
</pre>


= BBDBV3-Wl =

BBDBV3-Wl integrates BBDB in its third version into WanderLust. 

As BBDB-Wl does for BBDB version 2, this try to do the same for the third version of this personal database.

It's in alpha stage and is in intense developing.

== Getting it ==
You can get this searching the project at GNA! 

* [https://gna.org/projects/bbdbv3-wl/ The project] link.
* [http://home.gna.org/bbdbv3-wl/ Home page] of the project.
* [http://download.gna.org/bbdbv3-wl/ Download page] where the more stable version is.

== Installing and Configuring==
If you want to install it you just have to download one of the files from the [http://download.gna.org/bbdbv3-wl/ download page], and decompress.

Once you have all the files you have to tell emacs where to find them, this is accomplish adding the following in the .emacs file(or your InitFile):

    (setq load-path (cons "~/emacsstuff/bbdbv3-wl/lisp" load-path))

Change the <code>"~/emacsstuff/bbdbv3-wl/lisp"</code> with the path where you have just decompressed the tar file and there are the emacs-lisp files(those ones that ends with ".el").


After that, you have to tell emacs to load it at every start, this is done by adding after the last code inserted:

    (require 'bbdbV3-wl)


Summarizing, download, decompress, and add in the .emacs file (or in the InitFile) the following:

    (setq load-path (cons "~/emacsstuff/bbdbv3-wl/lisp" load-path))
    (require 'bbdbV3-wl)


== Using it ==

Just run WanderLust as usual and when you read an e-mail you find a new buffer below with the sender's information in the BBDB.
If the sender's information doesn't exists in the database, it will request if you like to add it.

== Comming ==
=== Revision 11 ===
This revision has added more integration with the WanderLust's address manager, so you can get its addresses and add it into BBDB with <code>bbdb-wl-take-data-from-addressbook</code>.

Also it has modularized everything a bit better.
