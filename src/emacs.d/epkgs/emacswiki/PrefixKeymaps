Assume you want to remap C-x because you have a Dvorak keyboard and
C-x is really uncomfortable.  You want to use C-q instead.  Now,
things are not as easy as with other keymappings because C-x doesn't
map to a command -- it maps to another keymap.  That's why you have to
type another key after hitting C-x.

In order to make C-q work just the same as C-x, you need to define the
keymap used for C-x as the keymap for C-q.  Luckily enough, the C-x
keymap is also accessible via a variable.  So in this case, all you
need is this:

 (global-set-key (kbd "C-q") ctl-x-map)

More on this can be found on the Prefix Keymaps node in the EmacsManual.

Note that not all of the keymaps are stored in variables.  If you need
to remap one of these anonymous keymaps, things will be only a bit more
difficult.  As an example, this should do the same as the above.

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-q") (lookup-key global-map (kbd "C-x")))
  ;; or the perhaps less formal notation
  (global-set-key [?\C-q]     (lookup-key global-map [?\C-x]))
