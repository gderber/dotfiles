This page is about library <tt>[[textmenu.el]]</tt>, which lets you use the keyboard to access menus.

See '''MenuAccessFromKeyboard''' for alternatives and more information.


== Discussion ==

We need a good replacement for `tmm' (`f10') which does not confuse the blind.
A start is available as ##textmenu.el##.  Read the documentation for `define-key' and improve it.

[new]
Please define "confuse the blind." I need to know what people like or don't like about ##tmm.el## and ##textmenu.el##. I have copious amounts of free time and quite a great bit of interest in making this work. Personal itches: changing keymaps and losing the ability to `C-h k'. -- SachaChua


== Bugs ==

Bugs in textmenu.el:

* Checkboxes not working -- '''Options''' menu, for example
* Disabled entries not working -- '''Edit''' menu, for example
* Keys not displayed -- use `where-is-internal' for that
