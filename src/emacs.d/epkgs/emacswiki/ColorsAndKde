I am using KDE.  I found my emacs was colored in a strange way no matter how I changed the background and foreground settings in my .Xdefaults.  I tried all methods I could think of, including deleting my .emacs, changing the font, recustomizing my KDE environment through the KDE control center. But without luck.

For KDE 2.1.2, I found the option called 'Apply fonts and colors to non-KDE apps' in '/Look and Feel/Style' in the control center. Disable it. Then logout and log in. Everything becomes fine.

This is also true for newer KDE versions, I've tested this eg for KDE 3.1. 
Look at Control Center | Look and Feel | Colors
(or if you have a german KDE: Erscheinungsbild | Farben)

In KDE 3.2.1, logout is not needed.
Uncheck "Apply colors to non-KDE applications" in "Control Center / Appearance & Themes / Colors" and start another Emacs.

In KDE 3.5.3 you also need to go to 'GTK Styles and Fonts' | 'GTK Styles' and select 'Use another style' and choose Raleigh.
In my experience, applying the KDE theme or the Qt theme to GTK apps will cause the funky coloring issue in (at least in cvs-emacs).

Since [http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/gtk-qt gtk-engines-qt-0.7] the strange coloring of emacs' background is gone, if you use "Use my KDE style/fonts in GTK applications" and use an emacs built with GTK widgets. With versions prior to 0.7 the empty emacs background was grey whereas the text-filled background was white.

2006-09-22 Jason Cornez: I'm using gentoo with gtk-engines-qt-0.7 and emacs-cvs-23 and I still see the background problem if the gtk theme is set to qt.  All my other gtk apps use the qt theme with no problems.  I did find a workaround that allows me to use one gtk theme with emacs 23 and the qt theme for everything else.
: 1. Set the gtk theme (using gtk-chtheme, for example) to something that you like and that works with emacs: Clearlooks is what I use.
: 2. This created ~/.gtkrc-2.0 with that theme set.  Copy the file: <code>cp ~/.gtkrc-2.0 ~/.gtkrc-2.0-emacs23</code>
: 3. Create a file ~/bin/emacs23 or /usr/local/bin/emacs23

    GTK2_RC_FILES=~/.gtkrc-2.0-emacs23
    emacs --enable-font-backend --font Monospace-10

: 4. Use emacs23 to launch emacs and now you can reset your gtk theme back to qt for the rest of your apps to use.
