This is a mode for editing Smarty PHP templates.

http://www.smarty.net/contribs/syntax_highlighting/emacs/smarty-mode.el

This mode should probably be rewritten to inherit most of it's functionality from HtmlMode or XmlMode.

A new Smarty-Mode has been written: http://lisp.morinie.fr/smarty/
This mode includes completion, highlight, menus, templates and is customizable.
(This is the smarty-mode included in [NxhtmlMode nXhtml] that works with MuMaMo.)
