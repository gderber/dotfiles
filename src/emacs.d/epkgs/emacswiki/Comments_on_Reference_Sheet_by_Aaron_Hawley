It is ''not'' true that `C-x C-v RET' is the same as `revert-buffer'.
See [[RevertBuffer#C-xC-vRETisNOTrevert-buffer|C-x C-v is not revert-buffer]].

Besides the Dired scenario, I can't find a reason to really care.

That doesn't surprise me.

What is true of `revert-buffer' in Dired is true in general.

* `revert-buffer' is a different command from `find-alternate-file'.  They are not defined to do the same thing.  Look at their code, if you want to understand this.

* `revert-buffer' applies to buffers other than just file buffers -- Dired is only one example of this.  See the doc for `revert-buffer'.

Fortunately, in "buffers other than just file buffers" these are modes where `revert-buffer' is bound to a better key than `C-x C-v RET' -- usually the `g' key.  I appreciate `revert-buffer-function' as a good hack for Emacs modes, but it does muddle the correspondence between the name of a command and its behavior in some cases.  One of the many dangers entailed in making a cheat sheet for a flawed text editor I suppose.

Dunno about "flawed text editor" ... but if you want to make your cheat sheet a bit more accurate without adding verbiage, consider changing "same as previous" to "similar to previous" or some such, in the description of `C-x C-v RET'.

And yes, a cheat sheet always runs the risk of misleading somewhat.  "Restore buffer with version on disk" also suffers in this regard.  Such is life on a cheat sheet. ;-)

I have written some code to convert the source to TeX and posted it on my blog.  I'm not sure how to share it with people, but feel free to take it from me.
