I use Emacs.

Started using emacs in 1988. Stopped using emacs in 1988. Started and stopped on and off over the years, then got serious about 2005. Still a beginner, then. :-) Beginning to move toward "living in emacs".

== My own stuff ==

; [https://github.com/PhilHudson/org-capture-vars.el org-capture-vars.el]: User-defined capture variables and prompts for Org-mode
; [https://github.com/PhilHudson/yasnippets My yasnippets]: Pretty cool, pretty smart snippets, giving you all or most of the seldom-used options for common Elisp forms while still making the most-common usage easy to choose.
: Idiosyncratic formatting; if you hate it, I understand. Why not fork it? If you do, please keep me posted, and I'll link to you.

== Plan ==

I'm gradually perfecting a multi-site-aware framework for init.el. You can (but don't have to) write host-, OS- and emacs-release-specific elisp files, and you can conditionally compile host-, OS-, and emacs-release-specific blocks of code within other files.

I have a few bits of elisp and emacs-driving shell script that I think may be useful to the community. I'll be putting them up Real Soon Now.
