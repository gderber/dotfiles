Tobias, thanks for writing this mode.  This is a nice feature of Notepad++ and it's great having it in Emacs.

I'd like to see this functionality added to the official Emacs distribution; until then I'm very grateful to have it available separately.

Thank you Pete Harlan, for the very constructive and helpful discussion on msearch! I think it improved msearch a lot. Almost everything (except the partial word feature) we spoke about can now be configured via customization.
