[http://home.hakuhale.net/rbc/ Bruce Carleton] posted a note to Emacs newsgroups ([http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=119l7uibfqdsrf6@corp.supernews.com 119l7uibfqdsrf6@corp.supernews.com]) looking for the source and full quote of comparing an Emacs hacker to a Jedi character in the movie Star Wars (see WikiPedia:Star_Wars):

 I'm pretty sure that I recall a quote somewhere comparing a programmer
 building an IDE with emacs being like a Jedi building their own lightsaber
 as a part of their training.
 
 I know it could sound like silly enthusiasm to some, but I kind of like that
 idea.  How did Ben Kenobi say it?  "Not as clumsy or random as a blaster. 
 An elegant weapon of a more civilized day."

 I've been hunting for the original source of the quote.  My searches on the
 net haven't turned it up.  I discussed it with one of my friends who is a
 real emacs fan and he had not heard or seen the quote before.  I'm pretty
 sure I didn't come up with it on my own.

 Would anyone be aware of an attribution to a quote like this?  I'd like to
 repeat it.
 
 Thanks,

I think the comparison to a lightsaber may have been said about Vi and not Emacs.
I know they named one of the Star Wars movies after Vi. I think it was called ''Star Wars Episode VI''.

The utility, quirkiness and beastiness of Emacs reminds me more of Han Solo's ship, the Millenium Falcon. --AaronHawley
