The best way to lookup Scheme symbols and read about them is with InfoMode and InfoLook.  This is setup in Emacs by default.  In Scheme Mode buffers, typing `C-h S' will search in the index Revised5 Report on Schema Programing (R5RS) for the the symbol at point.  You just need to install the R5RS info file into your InfoPath.

Scheme-lookup was a modified version of <code>hyperspec.el</code> (see CommonLispHyperspec), seeded with symbols from R5RS, finalized SRFIs and the manuals of several [[Scheme]] systems.  
It allows to simply put the TextCursor over a symbol and hit M-x scheme-lookup to jump to the relevant documentation.

To get scheme-lookup do

  darcs get http://twb.ath.cx/~twb/canon/scheme-lookup/

then follow the instructions at the top of scheme-lookup.el.  It should all be pretty self-explanatory.

(But that site has been dead since 2009-10-31).

== r5rs.el ==

Since scheme-lookup was dead, NumaTortolero wrote the Lisp:r5rs.el simple file to browse documentation from the R5RS Revised5 Report on Scheme Programing language.
