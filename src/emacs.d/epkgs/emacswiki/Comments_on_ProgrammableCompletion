Within EShell, pcomplete seems to not work for me on XP when sitting at a UNC path such as:

    //evon620c/c$/home/work/HPCMS/HPCMS 6.0/Agent/common/s $ cd ~/dow

pressing TAB here gives the error "Text is read-only".  Anyone verify this?  -- PatrickAnderson

This will be because the standard eshell-prompt-regexp expects there to be only a single $ before your command.  I use ##"^[^#\n]* [#$] "## instead.  Note that you'll need to escape any $ signs in the eshell command line, eg., ##cd //evon620c/c\$/home/##  -- RohanHart

This same issue appears even without a $ in the path if the directory to be completed starts with ~ and eshell-cmpl-ignore-case is true, using emacs 24  -- TuomasKuismin

Do newer versions of JavaCompletion use pcomplete? The copy from 2004 does not.
