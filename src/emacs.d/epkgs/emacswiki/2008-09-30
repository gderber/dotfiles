IrcClientSurvey says how I produced the list.

Irssi, ERC, and XChat continue dominating the list.
I think irssi remains popular because people keep it running inside GNU screen sessions.

"Purple" seems to refer to libpurple which is used by Pidgin & Gaim.

Previous issues: [[2007-12-21]]. Next survey: [[2009-04-02]].

Overheard on #emacs:

21:08 <jrockway> kensanata: i use irssi-proxy running under
      screen, and then connect to that with erc
21:08 <jrockway> so... your survey is totally flawed!!111! ;)
