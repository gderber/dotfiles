Here is a set of functions that I've wrote to make my programming in Emacs more simple because I haven't found any .el package that would implement what I wanted. I wanted 

* to compile the program with one keystroke
* to run program with one keystroke
* to run debugging easily
* to create a "standard" environment (directory structure, makefile etc.) :quickly and easily
* to have a tool that would generate useable makefile

All these things are included in the project package and it works on my computer. I didn't test it anywhere else, in even smoothly other environment or other OS but "it is suppossed" to run well because I tried not to include any platform dependent code. If you'll encounter any problem with installing and/or running this package you can email me. I will be glad to hear that you need this tool and will try to help you at any cost (excluding my life cost). 

Here you can download the package: http://neorural.jinak.cz/cgi/countdown.cgi?projects.tar.gz
: /Link is broken, here is an archive.org link:/ https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20070312215916/http://neorural.jinak.cz/data/projects.tar.gz

To install the package you are supposed to extract the file somewhere into your load-path (for example site-lisp) and then eval <code>(load "projects.el")</code>. The best way is to write it into your .emacs file, as you of course know.
