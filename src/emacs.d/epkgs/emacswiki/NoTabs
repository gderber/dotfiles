If you want to use spaces instead of tabs when indenting, put the following in your <tt>[InitFile .emacs]</tt> file:
{{{
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
}}}
You may also customize the `indent-tabs-mode' variable instead, obviously. If you want to remove tabs in an existing file, mark the whole buffer using ##C-x h## and use ##M-x untabify##. (##M-x tabify## does the opposite ...)

Discussion on whether this is a good idea: TabsAreEvil (or not).

If you wish to change the amount of spaces that the Tab key inserts, check out the TabStopList page. Do not confuse this with ##tab-width##, which is only good for displaying existing tabs in files!

The ##tab-width## variable tells Emacs how wide a tab is (more precisely, the distance between tab stops). You might want to set it to something other than ##8## before calling ##M-x untabify##.

== So How Do I Insert a Tab If I Really Have To? ==

Yes, of course you agree that TabsAreEvil. But you just ''have'' to indulge yourself a tab from time to time -- perhaps to create a file in some required format. Whaddya do?

'##C-q##' to the rescue! Don't forget it: '##C-q##' says "insert the next character, whatever it is" (command ##quoted-insert##).

So, '##C-q <tab>##' does the trick. -- DrewAdams

== Smart inference of indentation style ==

I prefer NoTabs, but sometimes I work on a project that does use tab indentation.  I don't want to cause problems for these source files.  As a result, I use the following snippet to default to no tabs, but to use tabs if that's what a pre-existing file is primarily using for indentation:
{{{
(defun infer-indentation-style ()
  ;; if our source file uses tabs, we use tabs, if spaces spaces, and if        
  ;; neither, we use the current indent-tabs-mode                               
  (let ((space-count (how-many "^  " (point-min) (point-max)))
        (tab-count (how-many "^\t" (point-min) (point-max))))
    (if (> space-count tab-count) (setq indent-tabs-mode nil))
    (if (> tab-count space-count) (setq indent-tabs-mode t))))
}}}
[in my c-mode hook, or whatever other mode I want to have smart indentation]
{{{
(setq indent-tabs-mode nil)
(infer-indentation-style)
}}}
