The command `M-x clean-buffer-list' is for KillingBuffers that are old and no longer needed.  It comes as a part of MidnightMode.

By default, [::clean-buffer-list] will kill buffers that haven't been visited in '''3 days''', or in the '''last hour''' in the case of ''special buffers'' that are named either
* "##*Help*##",
* "##*Apropos*##",
* "##*Buffer List*##",
* "##*Compile-Log*##",
* "##*info*##",
* "##*vc*##",
* "##*vc-diff*##" or
* "##*diff*##".

Some buffers are never killed, these include
* the "##*scratch*##" buffer,
* the "##*Messages*##" buffer,
* the "##*server*##" buffer,
* the minibuffers (which typically start with "## *Minibuf-##"),
* currently displayed buffers
* buffers attached to processes, and
* internal buffers that were never displayed
* buffers with files that are modified

The lifetime of general and special buffers can be customized, as can what buffers should be considered ''special'' and which buffers should never be killed.

To change the ''expiration date'' of all buffers, like to 1 day, set `clean-buffer-list-delay-general'.

    (setq clean-buffer-list-delay-general 1)

To change the ''expiration date'' of special buffers, to 6 hours, set `clean-buffer-list-delay-special'.

    (setq clean-buffer-list-delay-special (* 6 3600))

To add more buffers to the list of special buffers, add them to the list `clean-buffer-list-kill-buffer-names'.

    (setq clean-buffer-list-kill-buffer-names (nconc clean-buffer-list-kill-buffer-names
                 '("*buffer-selection*"
                   "*Finder*"
                   "*Finder Category*"
                   "*Finder-package*"
                   "*RE-Builder*"
                   "*vc-change-log*")))

To define more regular expressions that should match special buffers, add them to `clean-buffer-list-kill-regexps'.

    (setq clean-buffer-list-kill-regexps (nconc clean-buffer-list-kill-regexps
                 '("\\`\\*Customize .*\\*\\'"
                   "\\`\\*\\(Wo\\)?Man .*\\*\\'")))

To define buffers that should never be killed, add strings to the list `clean-buffer-list-kill-never-buffer-names'.

    (setq clean-buffer-list-kill-never-buffer-names (nconc clean-buffer-list-kill-never-buffer-names
                 '("*eshell*"
                   "*ielm*"
                   "*mail*"
                   "*w3m*"
                   "*w3m-cache*")))

To define regular expressions for buffers that should never be killed, add them to the list `clean-buffer-list-kill-never-regexps'.

    (setq clean-buffer-list-kill-never-regexps (nconc clean-buffer-list-kill-never-regexps
                 '("\\`\\*tramp/.*\\*\\`"
                   "\\`\\*ftp .*\\*\\`")))

The efforts of `clean-buffer-list' are logged in the ##*Messages*## buffer.  It Lists for each buffer the current timestamp, followed by the buffer's name, the number of seconds since a buffer was last visited, followed by the threshold seconds it needed to meet for deletion to occur.

As of 2009-10-02, DeskTop mode does not preserve the value of `buffer-display-time' for buffers, so the buffer's "age" is effectively restarted.  This means that buffers restored by a Desktop sessions are considered "new" by `clean-buffer-list', even though they would probably be considered "old" by the user.  Probably the best solution would only keep preserve the age -- difference from the current -- and not the actual date.  A solution that kept track of the absolute values of `buffer-display-time' would be hazardous because a Desktop session restored even only a day later would produce buffers that seem very old to `clean-buffer-list'.
