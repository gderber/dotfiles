Hello! I am delighted that someone had the foresight to type my name in StudlyCaps so that I could have my own wiki entry.

: Welcome to the wiki!  Note that the wiki engine cheats a bit -- on the recent changes page, all names appear to link to an existing page, even if the page does not exist, yet.  I fell for it, too, when I started using wiki (Meatball Wiki at the time).  :)  -- AlexSchroeder
