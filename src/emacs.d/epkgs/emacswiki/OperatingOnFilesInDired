On W32, the shell can do the right thing with every file, because
extensions are registered with the explorer.  See MsShellExecute.

When a file is 'right-clicked' from explorer, some of the available actions are 'verbs'.  The default verb is displayed in Bold face (in the right-click menu), and will be executed by default (from a double-click).  WThirtyTwoShellExecute exposes all of these verbs to the emacs user whether visiting the file, or while in Dired.

On Unix systems, the shell usually cannot do that.  On Unix systems
therefore, we must use something like TrivialMode, OpenWith or RunAssoc instead.

Why not using xdg-open that is part of freedesktop.org which is cross desktop compatible??
 I am using the following function to open files using the association defined in the Desktop environment:

<pre>
(defun dired-open-file ()
  "In dired, open the file named on this line."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((file (dired-get-filename nil t)))
    (call-process "xdg-open" nil 0 nil file)))
</pre>

In my .emacs I have a keybinding for using it from dired:

<pre>
(define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c o") 'dired-open-file)
</pre>

== Dired+ with W32 Browser ==

If you use [[DiredPlus#w32-browser|Dired+]] with <tt>[[w32-browser.el]]</tt> you can take advantage of MS Windows file associations in [[Dired]].  Just use `M-RET' to "open" a file using its file-association '''Open''' operation.  Use `C-RET' to open Windows Explorer to that file or folder.
