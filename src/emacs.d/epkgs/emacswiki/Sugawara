I use emacs(meadow).

* Lisp:trans-regions.el -- Transpose regions command.
* Lisp:lcomp.el -- list completion hacks!
* Lisp:highlight-cl.el -- Highlighting `cl' functions.
* Lisp:anything-yaetags.el -- Yet another etags interface with anything.
* Lisp:descbinds-anything.el -- replacement of `describe-bindings' with anything.
* Lisp:paint.el -- Make a emacs to the paint tool.
* VlineMode -- show vertical line (column highlighting) mode.

:: Very nice! Please consider adding a face variable (`defvar') for face `vline', and use that in your code. That way, other code can make the `vline' code use a particular face in some context, without affecting the user's choice for face `vline'. For example, other code could then do this:

             (let ((vline-style 'face)
                   (vline-face 'hl-line-face))
              ...)

Minor bug, I think: if `vline-show' gets called twice in a row for some reason, the highlighting is a bit messed up (space chars, in particular, seem shifted). A third call fixes it (workaround).

Question: Is it intentional that the highlighting doesn't appear if there is an active region (TransientMarkMode)?

:: Not intentional.  Priority of region highlighting seems be higher than [[text property]] and [[overlay]]. I have no idea for this problem. You have it?

I've converted anything-yaetags over to Lisp:helm-yaetags.el, it took nothing more than a find and replace of "anything" -> "helm". Hope that's OK with you. Also, many thanks for the original version! I've been using it for a while now and I really like it.
