[[ja:rcircのエンコーディング]]
When you join a channel such as ###nihongo##, you'll note the topic saying:
"use ISO-2022-JP, please".

The right way to do this for [[rcirc]] is to call
`set-rcirc-decode-coding-system' and `set-rcirc-encode-coding-system' once you've joined.

If you want to send messages using `iso-2022-jp' on #nihongo and stick to `utf-8' everywhere else, without having to invoke the above every time, use the following setting:

    (setq rcirc-coding-system-alist '(("#nihongo" iso-2022-jp))

(For this setting to take effect, you'll have to rejoin the channel!)

== Decode everything ==

AlexSchroeder recommends to set up Emacs to prefer UTF-8 everywhere and to use
`undecided' to decode incoming messages. Emacs will then try to decode the text
as UTF-8 and if that doesn't work, it will use its own heuristics to pick an
appropriate coding system.

    (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
    (setq rcirc-decode-coding-system 'undecided)

== /encoding command ==

Here's a convenient ##/encoding## command to change the current encoding for the current buffer only.

<kensanata> /encoding iso-2022-jp
<kensanata> 日本語 できません。

If you're confused, use it without any argument to see what you're currently using.

<kensanata> /encoding
; -kensanata-: utf-8

And here's the code for the ##/encoding## command:

{{{
(eval-after-load 'rcirc
  '(defun-rcirc-command encoding (arg)
     "Change the encoding coding system
`rcirc-encode-coding-system' for the current buffer only."
     (interactive)
     (if (string= arg "")
	 (rcirc-print process (rcirc-nick process) "NOTICE" target
		      (symbol-name rcirc-encode-coding-system))
       (setq rcirc-encode-coding-system (intern-soft arg)))))
}}}

If you follow AlexSchroeder's advice above and use `undecided' for decoding, a separate ##/decoding## command is unnecessary.
