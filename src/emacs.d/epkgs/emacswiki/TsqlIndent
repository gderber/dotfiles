 tsql-indent.el -- indents TSQL (and other SQL) statements

This is a hack inspired by AlexSchroeder's SqlIndent and by the excellent tutorial on indentation in "An Emacs language mode creation tutorial" (http://two-wugs.net/emacs/mode-tutorial.html).  

I wrote this code while working on a large number of Transact SQL stored procedures (yes, I know).  The code helped me indent other people's code to the same standard I was using, and it helped make the code more readable.

I'm new to Elisp hackery, and always interested in feedback.
