If you're wanting to learn Emacs or EmacsLisp you could do worse than finding a bunch of things to hack on and hacking on them.

Here's a list of people and projects you could hack on:

* GnuEmacs [http://debbugs.gnu.org/db/ix/full.html
 bugs] needing fixing (in many cases there is a patch to apply or the fix is otherwise simple). 
* [[Fuco]] (contact on emacs [[IRC]]) has stuff that you could do in:
** [[https://github.com/Fuco1/litable/blob/master/litable.el#L248|litable]] (lots of stuff for beginners)
** [[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks|dired hacks]] (this includes 6 projects right now with various states of breakage, something for beginners too)
** [[https://github.com/Fuco1/petulant-dangerzone|plist/alist api project]] (abstract thinking required, elisp knowledge is not essential)
** [[https://github.com/Fuco1/justify-kp|pretty justification engine]] (required for epub reader, that project is not created yet)
** [[https://github.com/Fuco1/ballin-octo-shame|better pairs parser for smartparens]] (this is a bit more difficult, not a great project for beginners)
** Write a package for [[https://github.com/Fuco1/org-inline-image|inlining of images in org-mode]], with support for various "image webs" (imgur albums, indirect links, deviant-art profiles, galleries etc.).  A direct-link embedding is a start.  Planned features: in-place zooming, rotation and stuff (see also dired-images in dired hacks project)
** Abstract the interface `dired-isearch-filenames' uses to filter results to allow simple creation of "filtering isearches". Ideally something like `(isearch-filtering-forward 'filter-stuff ...)' Current interface is clumsy and not very extensible.  Possible uses: run isearch searching only in function definitions (after defun), variable definitions (in C-like languages), specific columns in various tabulated views (search only package names in package-list) and so on.
** Write "eldocs" (and give it a better name), which would be a clone of javadoc/haddock/doxygen and similar tools to generate documentation from docstrings embeded in the code.  Output should go into org-mode format so we can then gerenate webpages, texinfo, markdown and whatever else we might want.  This would be most useful for projects like dash, s, kv, ht, f, ov, b,... (basically "better APIs" for emacs entities) to keep the docs up-to-date and in pretty and uncluttered formatting.  Of course, other bigger projects with tons of settings and functions would also benefit from this. (we can also add more features like embedding comments and stuff later).
* NicFerrier has stuff in [[https://github.com/nicferrier/elwikicreole/blob/master/creole.el|WikiCreole]], we need to add lots of OddMuse support
* [[JoeBloggs]] has a TODO list on his [[JoeBloggs|page]]
