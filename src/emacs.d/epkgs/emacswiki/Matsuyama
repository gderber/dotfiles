I love Emacs and Emacs Lisp.

* FlymakeJavaScript
* SqlBeautify
* AutoMark
* VisibleMark
* WThreeMReadability
* AnythingSources
* JavaScriptMode
* TranslationTable
* ThingAtPointOptional
* AutoComplete

Scripting by Emacs Lisp is very very wonderful. Here is my grep (it's just joke).

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/emacs --script

(find-file (cadr command-line-args-left))
(occur (car command-line-args-left))
(set-buffer "*Occur*")
(forward-line 1)
(princ (buffer-substring (point) (point-max)))
</pre>

Welcome on the Wiki !

Hi! -- [[rubikitch]]

Hi, you signed your previous edits as matsuyama (with lower case m). Which one will you use?

I will use upper case one. -- [[Matsuyama]]

My source definitions for [[Anything]].

Update: Moved to [[AnythingSources]]

Thanks for your [[Anything]] sources. OccurMode and VisibleBookmarks are the handiest for me. I use them with [[Anything#IciclesWithAnything|Icicles with Anything]]. Your Occur source, in particular, encouraged me to make sure that a function works (with [[Icicles]]) as a set of candidates. -- DrewAdams

I think your anything-c-source-* should be in [[Anything]] or AnythingSources page, because Anything users cannot find your sources. -- [[rubikitch]]

Done! -- [[Matsuyama]]
