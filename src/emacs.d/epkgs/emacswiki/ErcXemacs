Here's where we dump problems, questions, or code specific to getting ERC working happily in XEmacs.

----
for ErcChannelTracking, aka erc-track.el

first, I think advice might work differently in XEmacs, this works for me, though I also had to change switch-to-buffer to iswitchb-buffer:

 (require 'advice)
 (defadvice switch-to-buffer (after erc-remove-channel-from-modded-list activate)
  "remove channel from mod list when switching to that channel"
  (erc-modified-channels-update))

second, go to the beginning of this line "(if (fboundp 'define-minor-mode)" (it's 140 in ERC 2.93 Revision 1.286) of erc-track and hit M-x macroexpand-sexp, and replace that entire if (lines 140 to 226 for me) with the macroexpand result. Also, you'll need to comment out these two lines in the result:
 :global t
 :group 'erc
it seems that define-minor-mode in XEmacs does not have those two extra arguments.

That should at least get modified channels showing up in the modeline, and have them removed from the modeline when you switch to them.

I've mostly figured out how to get colors working in the modeline, but I need time to finish it.

Is there a way to change the face properties of `buffers-tab' locally for each
buffer?  If so, that might add an interesting (possibly simpler, yet not always
visible because buffer tabs are shown in groups) way for tracking channels in ERC.
