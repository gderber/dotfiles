PerlMacs is an attempt by JohnTobey to integrate Perl into
Emacs as an extension / scripting language.

* http://john-edwin-tobey.org/perlmacs/

The original approach was to link the Perl interpreter into Emacs
itself, although it seems as that was not particularly liked
by FSF officials. Anyway, the author works on a pipe based
system now -- EmacsEpl.
