==About==

My name is Roman Lagunov. I live in Russia. I've been using GNU/Emacs for many yers (perhaps six or seven, I don't remember :)

I'm using Emacs for:

* Reading news
* Writing some code
* Wastin time on irc
* Talk to other emacsers on jabber conferences
* Building my site
* And many other things.

I keep journal http://feuerfuchs45.livejournal.com, where I'm writing about Emacs a lot (in Russian).

And some time ago I've started my "Emacs homepage" [http://dotemacs.ru DotEmacs], which I made with EmacsMuse. In this page you can find some of my dotfiles, and my InitFile too.

Forget to say &mdash; this page was created with Emacs OddmuseMode.

So, that's all.
