* Lisp:spanish.el -- A small script I wrote to ask me spanish vocab and verb conjugations in the minibuffer while I'm waiting for something to compile. It:
** Keeps a global list of questions to be asked.
** Removes questions that are answered correctly
** Can ask in spanish or english
** Maintains a list of globally failed questions so you can figure out what you're having trouble with.
: I've been meaning to expand it to have statistics about each question, but it works well enough.
: I bind the functions as follows
** (global-set-key '[f12] 'askAndRemoveQuestions)
** (global-set-key [C-f12] 'initQuestions)
: I hit C-f12 to init the questions to ask, and then f12 to ask me a single question (or C-30 f12 to ask 30 questions)
: Let me know if someone turns this into something useful.
