Hi, my name is Wong !HongQin (王泓钦), I use "hqwrong" as my
nick name, for "wrong" sounds like "wong".

I use emacs since 2011. I love it, and use it everyday.

Here is a list of my elisp:

* Lisp:auto-preamble.el -- Auto-type the preamble of source code file.

* Lisp:hqw-goto.el -- A quick way to go to specific window line and position.
