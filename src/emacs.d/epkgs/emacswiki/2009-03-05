Not sure how good the munging is I do -- perhaps iPhone users will show up as Safari? I'm also not sure how many mobile users rely on Google Reader, Bloglines, and other aggregators. Then again, presentation for such services is not something I have to worry about. -- Alex

I read the rss feed thru googlereader on the iphone.

According this google hit by Matt Cutts the iPhone has the iPhone string in user agent:  

Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU like Mac OS X; en) !AppleWebKit/420+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0 Mobile/1A543a Safari/419.3

Ah, cool. In that case:

{{{
aschroeder@thinkmo:~/logs$ grep 'GET /emacs.*iPhone' access.log | wc -l
9
aschroeder@thinkmo:~/logs$ grep 'GET /emacs.*Mozilla' access.log | wc -l

I don't think we need to do anything fancy. I wonder whether adding ##<meta name="viewport" content="width=480" />## unconditionally will confuse any other mobile devices. -- Alex
