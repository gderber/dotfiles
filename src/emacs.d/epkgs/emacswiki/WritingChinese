== Input ==

Emacs has built-in support for many chinese input methods, packaged in leim. You can switch input method with C-\

Also Emacs supports the XIM protocol for X Windows applications and IME input method for MS Windows apps, such as wineinput or minichinput for Linux, and pyjj or MS pinyin for MS windows. Beware that you need to set the charset coding of your input method in the <tt>.emacs</tt> file to use windows IME input method, for example:
<pre>
(set-keyboard-coding-system 'chinese-iso-8bit)
</pre>

See also the <em>Specify Coding</em> node in EmacsManual.

If you want the double-width gb2312 equivalents of ASCII characters instead of the normal ASCII characters then this is useful:


    (global-set-key [(f2)]
		'(lambda () (interactive) 
		   (if (equal current-input-method "chinese-tonepy-punct")
		       (set-input-method 'chinese-qj)
		     (set-input-method 'chinese-tonepy-punct)
		     )
		   )
		)

Change <code>chinese-tonepy-punct</code> to your favourite Chinese input method.

An input method which does this automatically would be better, but this is beyond my expertise to write.

== Setup Example ==

This is my Chinese section in my .emacs file:

<pre>
; -*- Chinese-*-

(set-keyboard-coding-system 'chinese-iso-8bit)   ; input

(set-selection-coding-system 'chinese-iso-8bit)  ; copy/paste

(setq w32-enable-synthesized-fonts t)

(if (not (member '("-*-courier new-normal-r-*-*-13-*-*-*-c-*-fontset-chinese"
   . "fontset-chinese") fontset-alias-alist))

    (progn
        (create-fontset-from-fontset-spec	; chinese fontset
        "-*-Courier New-normal-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-c-*-fontset-chinese,
         chinese-gb2312:-*-MS Song-normal-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-c-*-gb2312*-*,
         chinese-big5-1:-*-MingLiU-normal-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-c-*-big5*-*,
         chinese-big5-2:-*-MingLiU-normal-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-c-*-big5*-*" t)
         
         (setq default-frame-alist
            (append
             '((font . "fontset-chinese"))
             default-frame-alist))
    )
)

; end

</pre>

== A Different Chinese Input Method ==

Recently, I wrote a package [[Eim]] to input chinese character. I think this is better
than quail for a chinese input method. I provide two input method
associate this package, the wubi and pinyin. The pinyin input method need a word file which 
can be found in my pages[http://learn.tsinghua.edu.cn:8080/2005211356/src/eim.zip]. More detail
describe can see EimForChinese

I test in emacs22 and cvs emacs.

== WuBi ==

There is a nice wubi package that I use.  Some information and tips are at WritingChineseWithWuBi.

Does anyone have the configuration w/o using M$ fonts, but AR PL fonts?
