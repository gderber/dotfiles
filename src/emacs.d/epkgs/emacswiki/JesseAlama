I've been an emacs user for several years (at least since 1998).

Currently learning: AllOut, PlannerMode.

Emacs mailer: CategoryGnus.

Favorite package: PlannerMode.

* My Lisp

- Lisp:planner-frame.el My idea was to somehow make the PlannerMode
  more of an emacs application along the lines of, say, WThreeM and
  CategoryGnus.  One way to get started with that is to provide a way
  of devoting a frame to the planner, and providing sensible exit and
  suspend functions.
