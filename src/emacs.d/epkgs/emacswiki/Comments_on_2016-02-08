Hi Alex. I've lost the look I've always used. How to regain it? Do I need to go choose it again? (Dunno whether it was Classic, but I will try that, if you say so.) Is there no way for my existing bookmarks to still work, retrieving the same look & feel I had before? -- DrewAdams

Bookmark a link like the following:

* https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rc;showedit=1;days=3;rollback=1;lang=;theme=;css=/css/emacs.css

(This would be my control-freak version of Recent Changes.)

Alternatively, edit your bookmark and change ##css=## to ##css=/css/emacs.css##. It probably also says ##bootstrap=0## somewhere and that no longer has any effect so you may as well remove it.

My recent-changes bookmark has neither ##css=## nor ##bootstrap=##. It is this:

    https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rc;days=7;all=0;rollback=1;showedit=1

I also have plenty of other Emacs Wiki bookmarks. Here is what I use for the Elisp Area:

    https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ElispArea

Am I supposed to change all of them? Previously, none of my bookmarks needed to contain info about CSS.

I want all pages on the wiki to be rendered in the original, simple style, whether bookmarked or not.

Just visit the link once and the CSS will be set in a cookie. I added it to my bookmark so that it would always get reset, just in case.

Sorry, but what link do I visit just once?

Bigger font – great! Sunglasses are not included – bad. One thing for sure: [[https://github.com/bburns/emacswiki-light-theme/issues/12 I'd love to see same theme but in inverted colors.]]

The move to HTTPS might have broken the [https://oddmuse.org/wiki/ReCaptcha_Extension ReCaptcha extension] we've been using. In the [https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Comments_on_ReCaptcha_Extension comments] you see a link to [https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.ch/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha.html Google launched reCAPTCHA v2]. I haven't looked into it, yet. For now, I've simply switched back to the [https://oddmuse.org/wiki/QuestionAsker_Extension QuestionAsker extension] which wants you to name the greatest editor out there. And you don't necessarily have to answer "Emacs". :)

There's now a [EmacsWiki:action=browse;id=CSS;css=/light.css;theme=dark Dark] variant of our new CSS by BrianBurns.

Sadly, my Chrome does not invert the logo like Firefox does. It looks incredible!
