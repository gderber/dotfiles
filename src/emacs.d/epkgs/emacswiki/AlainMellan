I used XEmacs, and now use Emacs on Linux and MacOS X

: Welcome to the wiki! -- AlexSchroeder

April 2004: I have been using XEmacs + xft on my laptop for a couple of months now. XEmacs was the last application without anti-aliased fonts. It's now fixed, thanks to these guys (http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~neubauer/xft-xemacs/). I just hope this patch is going to make it somehow in the XEmacs distribution!


January 2005: Woohooo! Xemacs 21.5.24 (beta version) now includes the Xft patches. I configured with <tt>--with-xft=emacs</tt>, et voil√†!

July 2007: after a decade of XEmacs, I switched back to Emacs. The emacs-unicode-2 CVS branch looks great, with font anti-aliasing and all. And Emacs feels much faster!

May 2010: Just installed Emacs 23.2, and I love it.

=== External compile hack ===

There are times where it's hard to get the right environment so that I can compile from within emacs. With this simple hack, I can compile outside of emacs and still get emacs to parse the compile log file to allow for quick access to errors.

Somehow, get the logfile of a compile operation, and then use emacsclient.
<pre>
make >& make.log
emacsclient -a cat --eval '(let () (setq compile-command "cat make.log") (recompile))'
</pre>

After that, I can use ESC-` to jump to the next error.

=== Emacs as SystemVerilog IDE ===

Almost :-)  But the following allows to parse error messages from Cadence's ncsim:

{{{
;;;
;;; ---- Scan IUS error messages -------------------------------------------
;;;

(load-library "compile")

(setq compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist             ; create regexp
      (append compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist
              '((ncsim "*[EWN],.+(\\(.*\\),\\([0-9]+\\)" 1 2 nil nil))))

(setq compilation-error-regexp-alist                   ; tell emacs to use it
      (cons 'ncsim compilation-error-regexp-alist))

}}}

Then I can do <tt>ESC-x compile</tt>, type the compile command, and open directly source files from the compile log error messages. Saves a lot of time.
