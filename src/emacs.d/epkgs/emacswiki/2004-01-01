The license was changed!  See the footer of this page.

If you remember the old suggestion from the texinfo manual before the FDL
was written, please help me fix http://www.emacswiki.org/OLD.  The current
version I derived from the XEmacs manual license, which reads as follows:

<pre>
   Permission is granted to make and distribute verbatim copies of this
manual provided the copyright notice and this permission notice are
preserved on all copies.

   Permission is granted to copy and distribute modified versions of
this manual under the conditions for verbatim copying, provided also
that the sections entitled "The GNU Manifesto", "Distribution" and "GNU
General Public License" are included exactly as in the original, and
provided that the entire resulting derived work is distributed under the
terms of a permission notice identical to this one.

   Permission is granted to copy and distribute translations of this
manual into another language, under the above conditions for modified
versions, except that the sections entitled "The GNU Manifesto",
"Distribution" and "GNU General Public License" may be included in a
translation approved by the author instead of in the original English.
</pre>

But we don't have the three sections mentioned in this text, and so I shortened the thing, replaced "manual" with "document" and now I am wondering whether that's good enough or not.
