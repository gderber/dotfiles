Hello.

My name is Samuel Tesla, and only six months ago I was a vim user.  I used mutt to read my email and keep track of addresses, BitchX or X-chat to IRC.  I thought Lisp was this crazy language that only researchers used (and had too many parens).  I was happy in my ignorance.

But then I wanted an outliner.

All I needed was as *outliner*.

I found one for vim, but it just didn't work the way I wanted.  So I fired up emacs and played C-h t.  That did it.  OutlineMode did just what I wanted.  I switched to emacs.

Now I use CategoryGnus to read my email, EmacsIRCClient to IRC, and I'm learning EmacsLisp.  I love Emacs.  I especially love RubyMode.
