I've used both emacs and xemacs since 1992.  I write code for a living and sometimes for fun as well.  I mostly use emacs, now-a-days.

I'll put more emacsen things here when I have more time.

Index of pages I've added:
; PerlTidyElisp : Some elisp code to run either a buffer or region through an external program (perltidy)
