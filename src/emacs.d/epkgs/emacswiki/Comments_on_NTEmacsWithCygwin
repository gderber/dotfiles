Why not?

The cygwin documentation itself seems to disagree: http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-env.html

----

Putting Cygwin's path first will override Windows' builtin commands like `find' which have different semantics than the Unix version.  This can break batch file scripts.

I don't where the cygwin documentation says anything about it either way (at least, looking at the Sep 2018 version of that page).
