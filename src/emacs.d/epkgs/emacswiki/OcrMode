OCR is a major mode to assist in the onerous task of proofreading text generated by OCR programs. It's basically a single-user, localized, Emacs-based re-implementation of the Project Gutenberg Distributed Proofreaders web interface. It looks like this in operation:

The code, and more information, can be found [http://mdxi.collapsar.net/hacks/emacs/ocr-mode/ here].

== Recent Updates ==

* ''2004-09-14'': ocr-mode now recovers automatically from all manner of user-inflicted window/buffer twiddling
* ''2004-09-09'': Windows can now be sized to any width on startup (and associated tweaks); the "start at arbitrary pageset" functionality has moved from ocr-resume to ocr-init

See the [http://mdxi.collapsar.net/hacks/emacs/ocr-mode/ChangeLog ChangeLog] for full update info

PGDP auto-edits coming soon.
