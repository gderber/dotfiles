== What it is ==
A major mode for editing .m-files containing Matlab code. Matlab is proprietary software for numerical maths and data analysis.  Also note that Emacs (21.3 onwards) comes with an alternative built in: octave mode.  Octave is a free software alternative to Matlab. 

== How To Use It ==
Put into your init-file (~/.emacs, ~/.xemacs/init.el, whatever) 

 (autoload 'matlab-mode "matlab" "Matlab Editing Mode" t)
 (add-to-list
  'auto-mode-alist
  '("\\.m$" . matlab-mode))
 (setq matlab-indent-function t)
 (setq matlab-shell-command "matlab")

=== On Win32 ===

MATLAB is not a CLI application on MS Windows. One needs a shell wrapper that would pipe emacs input into a Matlab and back.
One can get that from http://www.cs.umb.edu/~ram/matlabShell/index.html .
The only problem is that it does not allow multiline commands. This is crucial if one intends to use it with org-babel .
There is a [https://github.com/mlt/matlabShell workaround available] until better solution is found.
[http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/newsreader/view_thread/13365 Here] it is explained how to set things up. However ##""## shall be replaced with ##'()##

Here is mine ##C:/Programs/matlabshell/matlabshell.cmd##

    @echo off
    SET PATH=C:\PROGRA~1\MATLAB\R2011a\bin;C:\PROGRA~1\MATLAB\R2011a\bin\win32
    %~dp0\matlabShell.exe 10000 20000

And here is what I have in dot emacs

    (setq matlab-shell-command "c:/Programs/matlabshell/matlabshell.cmd")
    (setq matlab-shell-command-switches '())
    (setq matlab-shell-echoes nil)


== On Mac ==
Matlab on Mac is accessible as a CLI application on Mac (and maybe Linux) with settings similar to the following:

    % CLI matlab from the shell:
    % /Applications/MATLAB_R2016a.app/bin/matlab -nodesktop
    %
    % elisp setup for matlab-mode:
    (setq matlab-shell-command "/Applications/MATLAB_R2016a.app/bin/matlab")
    (setq matlab-shell-command-switches (list "-nodesktop"))
