=Mark unidentified users=

[http://freenode.net/ freenode] (irc://irc.freenode.net) added a capability to
its ircd (dancer) a couple years ago which makes it possible to see who has
identified to NickServ (see ErcNickserv if you'd like to identify your own
nickname) and who hasn't.  It's called CAPAB IDENTIFY-MSG.  If you send
that command to a server running an ircd based on dancer, a flag will be added
to all messages sent by users. A plus sign is added to identified users'
messages and a minus sign is added to the messages of unidentified users.

The `erc-capab-identify' module enables this capability on servers that
support it.  It then removes the flag from all incoming messages and marks
unidentified users by adding the prefix `erc-capab-identify-prefix' to users'
nicknames, by default an asterisk (*).

Here's an example of how users are marked in a sample conversation (new-user
is unidentified).

    <user1> this is a sample conversation
    <user2> testing, testing
    <*new-user> hey

Customize `erc-capab-identify-unidentified' to change the look of the prefix's
face.  You might want to choose a color that is close to the background
color so that users' nicknames stand out more.


See http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#spoofing and
http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#registering to find further explanations of this
capability.
