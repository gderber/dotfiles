You piqued my curiosity: Why the german TLD, then?  -- AlexSchroeder

(that is, the TLD of charente.de, which I just changed to jabber.cd.chalmers.se)  charente.de was one of very few European Jabber servers when I started using Jabber, so that's where I first registered an account.  Now, there's a Jabber server at my university.  --- MagnusHenoch
