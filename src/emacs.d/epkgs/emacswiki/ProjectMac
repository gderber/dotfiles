"Project MAC" was a project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) started in the 1970s.
KentPitman says "The acronym MAC stood for no particular thing, but various meanings were attached, such as:
Men and Computers, Minds and Cognition, Machine-Aided Cognition, etc."

In his excellent book "Hackers, heroes of the computer revolution" (see HackersTheBook) Steven Levy writes:

: ''So by the early sixties, MIT had obtained a long-range grant for its time-sharing project, which would be named Project MAC (the initials stood for two things: Multiple Access Computing, and Machine Aided Cognition). ''

Project MAC, and in particular the MIT AI Lab, was the environment which spawned TecoEmacs.
