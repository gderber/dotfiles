At the very top when talking about kill / yanking backwards, I think it is supposed to say 'M-0 C-k', not 'C-0 C-k'. Feeding numeric arguments without using C-u usually involves typing M-<d>, where <d> is the numeric argument.

Am I wrong here?

If you use GUI Emacs (not terminal Emacs) then you can use either `M-0' or `C-0'. But it is better for the page to say `M-0', because that works more generally. I've edited it accordingly. Thx.
