Do you want to try to use eshell as your daily shell? Do you want to popup
a new frame, showing a new eshell buffer? Do you want that buffer to be deleted
once the frame closes and vice-versa? Call the following code by executing

    emacs-client -a "" -t -e '(server-eshell)'

{{{
(require 'cl)

(defun server-eshell ()
  "Command to be called by emacs-client to start a new shell.

A new eshell will be created. When the frame is closed, the buffer is deleted or the shell exits,
then hooks will take care that the other actions happen. For example, when the frame is closed,
then the buffer will be deleted and the client disconnected.

Also creates a local binding of 'C-x #' to kill the buffer."
  (lexical-let ((buf (eshell t))
                (client (first server-clients))
                (frame (selected-frame)))
    (labels ((close (&optional arg)
                (when (not (boundp 'cve/recurse))
                  (let ((cve/recurse t))
                    (delete-frame frame)
                    (kill-buffer buf)
                    (server-delete-client client)))))
    (add-hook 'eshell-exit-hook #'close t t)
    (add-hook 'delete-frame-functions #'close t t))
    (local-set-key (kbd "C-x #") (lambda () (interactive) (kill-buffer buf)))
    (delete-other-windows)
    nil))
}}}

== Ceveats ==
This doesn't work when you delete the frame while you are visiting a buffer other than
the eshell created by this function.
