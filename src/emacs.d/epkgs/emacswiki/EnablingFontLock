To manually turn FontLockMode on or off use either the ''Options'' -> ''Syntax Highlighting'' in the menu, or type `M-x font-lock-mode'.  Both toggle the option when you use them.

To turn on font-lock automatically every time you start Emacs either edit your InitFile (shown below) or turn it on via the menu  with ''Options'' -> ''Save Options''.

Here's what you can put in your InitFile to enable font-lock globally.  It works for both Emacs and XEmacs.

<pre>
(if (fboundp 'global-font-lock-mode)
    (global-font-lock-mode 1)        ; GNU Emacs
  (setq font-lock-auto-fontify t))   ; XEmacs
</pre>

In SXEmacs, I've found that I need to add the following to my ~/.sxemacs/init.el file in order for newly visited files to have font-lock-mode turned on:

{{{
(setq font-lock-auto-fontify t)
(add-hook 'find-file-hooks (lambda () (font-lock-mode 1)))
}}}

Which files are then highlighted?

[new]
In an Emacs 21.4.1 with global-font-lock-mode on, it works with LISP, C, HTML, ... but not for instance with .css oder .js.
Is it because of the Emacs version?

[new]
For syntax highlighting to work there must be a major mode for it.
There are major modes for both .css (CssMode) and .js (JavaScriptMode)

[new]
Also check the `font-lock-maximum-size' variable
