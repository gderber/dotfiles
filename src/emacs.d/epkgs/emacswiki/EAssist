EAssist stands for Emacs Assist

It uses CEDET to parse files and outputs list of functions/methods for current file.
Then you can type a part of function name and list will be reduced.

= Usage example =

Standing in a sample C++ file, press M-m.
Complete list of functions and methods will appear:

<pre>
void MyClass::getIntParameterOne
void MyClass::getIntParameterTwo
void MyClass::setIntParameterOne
void MyClass::setIntParameterTwo
void MyClass::fooMethod
int fooFunction
</pre>

Type "get" and list will be reduced to:

<pre>
void MyClass::getIntParameterOne
void MyClass::getIntParameterTwo
</pre>

You might choose method among these two, or just continue typing: "get one". It will reduce list to:

<pre>
void MyClass::getIntParameterOne
</pre>

Then press enter to jump the method.

= Setup =

'''Important Update''': EAssist is now a part of CEDET, provided as a module in contrib folder of CEDET distribution. CEDET 1.0pre4
doesnt still have EAssist, but later versions will. CVS tree of CEDET already contains EAssist. If you are using CEDET from CVS or CEDET version later than 1.0pre3 please follow install instructions in contrib/INSTALL file.

EAssist uses CollectionOfEmacsDevelopmentEnvironmentTools to parse files. The latter should be installed before using EAssist.
[[eassist.el]] is EAssist source.
Add the following lines to your .emacs file to add EAssist keybindings:

<pre>
(defun my-c-mode-common-hook ()
   (define-key c-mode-base-map (kbd "M-o") 'eassist-switch-h-cpp)
   (define-key c-mode-base-map (kbd "M-m") 'eassist-list-methods))
(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-common-hook)
</pre>

This will add M-o and M-m combinations to your c-mode. M-m will produce method/function list. M-o will switch from header to body file and backwards (for C++ only).

= Feature requests =

* It would be great if the .cpp/.h switching also searched in the ../include and ../src directory as that is quite a common way of organizing the files.
* Flex matching/fuzzy completion would be great.
* a fixed line at the top/bottom of the screen showing which letters you already entered

= Alternatives =

* [https://github.com/michaelw/buftoggle buftoggle.el] provides functions to switch between related files and buffers, and also allows to set up search paths on a per-directory basis.
* [[toggle.el]] quickly open corresponding file (eg test vs imll)
* FindOtherFile -- built-in capability for GNU Emacs
