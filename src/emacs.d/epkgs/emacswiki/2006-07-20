WikiSpam is starting to increase on the site.  Are there EmacsWikiAdministrators that would be willing to step forward to update BannedHosts or BannedContent before Alex gets back?

Our humble leader is back, nevermind.

I'll be gone for another five days starting tomorrow, so there's still plenty of opportunity for admins to step up.

By the way, I encourage existing admins to spread the password to other trusted people, should they feel like recruiting more admins.

As for "leader", there's an anti-German joke we make here in Switzerland: "Warum heisst es in der Schweiz Fahrausweis und nicht Führerausweis? Weil der Führer eine deutsche Erfindung war." Basically it has to do with leader being a "Führer" and that having become synonymous with Hitler...
