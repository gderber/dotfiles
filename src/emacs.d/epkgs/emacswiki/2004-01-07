ChrisGray posted on emacs-devel today using the subject "More antialiasing work":

: Well the winter holidays have come and gone, and I got to do a little
more hacking on antialiasing fonts for emacs on X.  For those who want
to follow the development, I have an arch archive located at
http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~cmg/{archive} .  You might need to register
Miles Bader's archive as well.  It is at
http://arch.linuxguru.net/~miles/miles@gnu.org--gnu-2003 .  

: The latest version is much more stable than the patch I had previously
announced, though not as feature complete.  It is certainly not
something you would want to give up your regular emacs for.  

: Please let me know what you think.

: Cheers,
: Chris
