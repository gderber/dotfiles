This page is about running additional Emacs configurations without interfering with your default configuration.

Reasons for doing this include:

* Trying a fully-featured configuration such as [[Prelude]].
* Experimenting with someone else's configuration.
* Trying out a new (or updated) package which may conflict with your current config.
* Hacking on a copy of your config without breaking your default config.
* Updating a copy of your config to work on a new release of Emacs without breaking your current config.

Shell script [[emacs-distribution]] provides an easy way to run multiple side-by-side instances of Emacs using varying configurations.
