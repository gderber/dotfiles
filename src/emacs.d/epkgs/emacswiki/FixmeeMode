==Overview==

Quickly navigate to FIXME notices in code.

Fixmee-mode tracks "fixme" notices in code comments, highlights them,
ranks them by urgency, and lets you navigate to them quickly.

Urgency of "fixme" notices is indicated by repeating the final character.
For example, one might write "FIXMEEEEEEEEE" for an important issue.

==Quickstart==

Add the following to your ~/.emacs

	(require 'fixmee)
	(global-fixmee-mode 1)

Then, open some buffers and right-click on the word "fixme" in a
comment,

or press

	C-c f

or

	M-x fixmee RET

==Key Bindings==

The default key bindings are

	C-c f `fixmee-goto-nextmost-urgent'
	C-c F `fixmee-goto-prevmost-urgent'
	M-n   `fixmee-goto-next-by-position'      ; only when the point is
	M-p   `fixmee-goto-previous-by-position'  ; inside a fixme notice

When the smartrep package is installed, the "C-c" prefix need not
be used for consecutive fixmee-mode keyboard commands.  Instead, just
keep pressing "f" (or whichever key you set in customize).

There is also a context menu and mouse-wheel bindings on the
minor-mode lighter in the modeline:

            mouse-1   context menu
      wheel-down/up   next/prev by urgency
    M-wheel-down/up   next/prev by position

==Patterns==

The following fixme patterns are supported by default:

    @@@
    XXX         ; only this one is case-sensitive
    todo
    fixme
