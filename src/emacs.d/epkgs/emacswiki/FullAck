Full-ack version 0.2.2 or newer (available on [http://github.com/nschum/full-ack github]) is required if you use Ack version 1.94 or newer.
 
On Debian you probably want to add this :

(setq ack-executable (executable-find "ack-grep"))

to make it works since the executable is called ack-grep and not ack
