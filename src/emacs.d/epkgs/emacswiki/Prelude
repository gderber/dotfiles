*Prelude* has the goal to ease the initial Emacs setup process and to provide you with a much more powerful and productive experience than that you get out of the box. By using Emacs Prelude you're basically getting a "Get me out of the nasty _get to know Emacs enough to be able to use it_ process, I just want to use Emacs" card.

Emacs Prelude is compatible ONLY with GNU Emacs 24.4 and up.

== Installation == 

Assuming you're using an Unix-like OS (*BSD, GNU/Linux, OS X, Solaris, etc), you already have Emacs 24 installed, as well as git & curl you can skip the whole manual and just type in your favorite shell the following command:

    curl -L https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/raw/master/utils/installer.sh | sh

You can now power up your Emacs, sit back and enjoy Prelude.

More information and installation instructions are available on [https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude GitHub].
