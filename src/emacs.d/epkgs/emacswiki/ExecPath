[[ja:実行パス]]
This variable is the equivalent of the ##PATH## environment variable for Emacs. It contains a list of directories Emacs will search for executables.

Here's an example of appending the /sw/bin directory to the exec-path and PATH variables (useful for Mac OS X users running LaTeX):

    (setenv "PATH" (concat (getenv "PATH") ":/sw/bin"))
    (setq exec-path (append exec-path '("/sw/bin")))

I found there are difference between exec-path and PATH.
* The value of environment variable “PATH” is used by emacs when you are running a shell in emacs, similar to when you are using a shell in a terminal. 
* The exec-path is used by emacs itself to find programs it needs for its features, such as spell checking, file compression, compiling, grep, diff, etc.
