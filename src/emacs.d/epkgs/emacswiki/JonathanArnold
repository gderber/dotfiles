I've been using Emacs ever since I started programming, back in the early 80s.  It is an important arsenal in my programming toolbox, as I am usually working on cross-platform development. These days, I work on Linux (usually Red Hat), Mac OSX and, most often, Windows.  I use the [EmacsForWindows NTEmacs] port on Windows (it has better Windows integration than the Cygwin port), and GnuEmacs on the other ones.  I don't think I would be half as productive if I had to use a special editor on each and every platform I've ever used in the past 25 years.

You can find more info about me at my various blogs, all hosted on my FreeBSD box:

Cool quote from my fortune today:

== My .emacs file ==

Here is my .emacs file.  I've been carrying it around with me for years. Probably lots of it is obsolete, or could be done better, or completely mysterious!

Lisp:JonathanArnoldDotEmacs

== Packages I use ==

Here are the various Emacs bits I use.  Some come with it, some are external. These are all either required or autoloaded in my JonathanArnoldDotEmacs file:

* PlannerMode - Just started to use this.  It is a ToDo list, notes, etc.
* CPlusPlusMode - Where I spend 75% of my time, editing C++ files
* GnuClient - The best OS interface, where you can easily pop a file into Emacs from whereever you are in the OS
* PhpMode - Another favorite programming language
* MsShellExecute - Win32 shell interaction
* BrowseUrl - Pass a url to a web browser
* JavaDevelopmentEnvironment -   a priceless interface when I'm doing Java work (rarely these days)
* [[MSB]] - Mouse Select Buffer. Yeah, I know, I shouldn't be using a mouse...
* [[BS]] - an improved Buffer Selection
* SlashDot - Download headlines from Slashdot.org, and make viewing simple.
* [[Ishl]] - extra isearch highlighting
* MouseMe - mouse menu with commands that operate on strings (yeah yeah, more mouse stuff)
* HTMLize (see SaveAsHtml for more info) - HTML-ize font-lock buffers
* cygwin-mount - Teach EMACS about CygWin styles and mount points. See NTEmacsWithCygwin for more.
* generic-x - Extra Modes for generic-mode (used for Javascript mode).  See HtmlModeDeluxe for more info on this
* JavaScriptMode - Major mode for editing JavaScript source code
* ErcMode - Emacs IRC
* [[emacs-w3m]] - an Emacs interface to w3m
* OrgMode - use this for everything from a project reminder to a journal
* PerforceSCM - my SCCS of choice
* NewsTicker - since the demise of Google Reader, I'm trying to use Emacs as an RSS reader
* [[Iedit]] - edit multiple instances
