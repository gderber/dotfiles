HideSearch is similar to the standard emacs "isearch", but incrementally hides non-matching lines as it searches.

* Lisp:hidesearch.el

See the comments at the top of this file for how to get it working and other tips.

It depends on hide-lines.el, to handle the work of doing the actual hiding.

* Lisp:hide-lines.el
