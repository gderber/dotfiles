JemPkg is an "amateur packaging system"... more or less... would be better to call it an "emacs home manager" or some other amusing name...

Seriously, JemPkg is a little elisp library that should facilitate the management of your local per-user
emacs installation. It has support for several versions of the same package, and for several configuration
schemes (one for the laptop and one for house's computer, for example). 

Details about the usage of the package and the package itself are on its homepage: http://www.jemarch.net/jempkg.html
