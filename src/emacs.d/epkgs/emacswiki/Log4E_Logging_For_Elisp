                                                  (error . "error")
                                                  (warn  . "warn")
                                                  (info  . "info")
                                                  (debug . "debug")
                                                  (trace . "trace")))

(defun hoge-do-hoge (hoge)
  (if (not (stringp hoge))
      (progn (hoge--fatal "failed do hoge : hoge is '%s'" hoge)
             (hoge--log-open-log-if-debug))
    (hoge--debug "start do hoge about '%s'" hoge)
    (message "hoge!")
    (hoge--info "done hoge about '%s'" hoge)))
