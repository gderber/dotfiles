It says:

[quote]
If she wants to use her inbox at work account as the main inbox, she can put in her .vm file:

    (setq vm-primary-inbox "imap-ssl:mail.foocorp.com:993:inbox:login:becky:*")

This refers to the inbox folder on foocorp, specifically. We canâ€™t use * as the MAILBOX here. Once this is done, she can just use M-x vm to read her inbox at work.
[/quote]

This is contradictory. I think what is meant is:

[code](setq vm-primary-inbox "imap-ssl:mail.foocorp.com:993:inbox:login:becky:inbox")[/code]

otherwise the comment doesn't make sense.

Sorry, what I said is nonsense. The * is the password.
