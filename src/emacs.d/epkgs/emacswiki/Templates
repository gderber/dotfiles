There are two extension packages to create files from a template:

* emacs-template by Christopher Wedler : [http://emacs-template.sourceforge.net/]
* file-template by Scott Frazer [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/file-template.el]

emacs-template is more complete:

* it has some on-line documentation.
* it comprises some interesing additional functions (such as comment decoration, buffer header update at when saving)
