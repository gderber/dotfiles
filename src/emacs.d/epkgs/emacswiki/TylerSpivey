Hello. I am just getting back into Emacs as of ~September 2008. I have been an ed user for around 10 years, so getting
into the Emacs mindset is a bit strange. I am blind, so having good access is important. Ed gives me
the access with speech, but doesn't do so well with braille nor does it have features for selecting and operating on
anything more than lines.
More to be added later

If you have any questions about how I operate my computer or whatever, you can find me as tsp on Freenode.
