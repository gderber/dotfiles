TranslationTable is used for transfering characters such as inserted characters by `self-insert-command'.

Taking advantage of this behavier, you can use DvorakLayout only on inserting characters not on `M-x', for example.

Lisp:trantab.el

If you want to use DvorakLayout, put the following code into your ~/.emacs:

<pre>
(require 'trantab)
(setq translation-table-for-input translation-table-dvorak-us)
</pre>
