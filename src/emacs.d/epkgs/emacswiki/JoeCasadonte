I've been using Emacs for about a year and a half now.  Before that I was a staunch VILE user (VI Like Emacs, a VI implementation based on top of an old Micro-Emacs implementation).  I love tweaking editors, so my love of Emacs should be kind of obvious....

I have an Emacs page at:

:: http://www.northbound-train.com/emacs.html

which has all of the little things I've contributed so far, as well as some links and code snippets I've collected.

Enjoy!
