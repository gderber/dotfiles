As an intermediate step, we could replace our current main markup extension [[Oddmuse:Usemod Markup Extension]]) with a Creole implementation ([[Oddmuse:Creole Markup Extension]]). This would allow us to convert existing pages. If you are one of the EmacsWikiAdministrators, there is a way to run search & replace operations on the entire wiki using Perl regular expressions. If you wanted to get involved, I could set up a /copy/ of the site to experiment on.

As far as I remember, the only thing that's tricky is that the table syntax is different:

{{{
|| foo || bar ||
}}}

vs.

{{{
| foo | bar |
}}}

The problem is, of course, to figure out which occurrences of ##||## are actually part of table markup and which are not.

Also note that it is possible to [WikiDownload download] all the pages, process them offline, and upload them again using scripts
([[Oddmuse:Automatic Posting and Uploading]]).

I was just going to have a pre-parser for tables. I wanted to be able to run a piece of text through it to convert || tables to | tables. I could then put that before the creole conversion (so we could just present what people were putting in) //or// before the save (thus converting what people were inputting).

Eventually we'd run the pre-parser across all the data converting everything that remained.

That was my plan for tables.

I think any switch to creole would require the same kind of processing?

Yes, you're right.

If I made some Elisp you could integrate it? or translate it to perl?

It would have to be Perl and it would obviously depend on the kind of code you'd want to add.

Well, I mean I could give you this table converter code and you could add it to the existing perl workflow, running it before the page transfrom.
 I guess that might be really slow?

This was mostly resolved on IRC. See [[Elwiki]] for details.
