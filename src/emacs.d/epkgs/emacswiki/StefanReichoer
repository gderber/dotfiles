I use Emacs as my favourite Text editor since 1998.

My Emacs configuration and some of my Emacs packages can be found at
http://www.xsteve.at/prg/emacs

I have written a subversion interface for emacs: psvn.el 
(http://www.xsteve.at/prg/vc_svn/)

Currently I am developing a tla interface for emacs: xtla.el.
You can find more information here: http://www.xsteve.at/prg/vc_arch/

Recently I started to use debian. There also exists a Wiki at
http://wiki.debian.net

I like the HippieExpand functionality very much so I just started a page for it.
