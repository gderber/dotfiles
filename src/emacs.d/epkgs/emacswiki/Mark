The '''[::mark]''' is one end of the [[region]]; the other end is [[point]].

There is only one current mark in a [[buffer]], but you can access past positions of the mark, sometimes also referred to also as "marks". In particular, you can cycle among these positions.

Being a buffer position, the mark is located before or after a character. It is updated dynamically whenever the buffer's contents are modified.

You can set the mark in any of these ways:

* `C-SPC' (point stays where it was)
* dragging point with `mouse-1' (old point becomes mark)
* clicking `mouse-3' (clicked position becomes point; old point becomes mark)

See MarkCommands for information on commands involving the mark.
