;;
;; This library provides various miscellaneous `ido' related commands & functions
;; that I use occasionally. 
;;

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below is a complete command list:
;;
;; `ido-execute-extended-command'
;;  Use `ido' to select a command to execute.
;; `ido-bookmark-jump'
;;  Switch to bookmark interactively using `ido'.
;; `ido-run-associated-program'
;;  Open the current candidate file with `run-associated-program'.
;;  `ido-goto-favourite'
;;  Choose commonly used file/dired buffer with ido, and jump to it.
;;  `ido-goto-recent-file'
;;  Choose recently used file with ido, and jump to it.
;;  `ido-goto-recent-dir'
;;  Choose recently used dired buffer with ido, and jump to it.
;;  `ido-cdargs'
;;  Choose cdargs bookmark and jump to corresponding directory
;;
;;; Functions:
;;
;; The following functions are defined:
;;
;; `ido-sort-mtime'
;;  Sort ido filelist by modification time instead of alphabetically.
;; `ido-completing-read-multiple'
;;  Read multiple items with `ido-completing-read'.
;;
;;; Customize:
;;
;; `ido-favourites-list'
;; List of choice-action pairs for use with the `ido-goto-favourite' command.
;; `ido-cdargs-config'
;; Location of cdargs config file.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put ido-jb-misc-extras.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'ido-jb-misc-extras)

;; To ensure files are sorted by modification time when using `ido-find-file',
;; put the following line somewhere in your startup file (~/.emacs):

;; (add-hook 'ido-make-file-list-hook 'ido-sort-mtime)
