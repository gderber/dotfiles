Emacs' failure to have a sensible project occur prompts a lot of people to write one. I've written several over the years.

I'm quite happy with this latest one that I've written using Fuco and Magnar's [[http://github.com/magnars/dash|dash library]].

{{{
(require 'dash)

(defun project-occur/dirtree-files (start-dir &rest not-files)
  "List all the files under START-DIR.

Automatically ignores .files and any filename specified in
NOT-FILES."
  (->> (directory-files start-dir t "^[^.].*[^~#]$")
    (--filter (not (member (file-name-nondirectory it) not-files)))
    (--map 
     (if (file-directory-p it)
         (project-occur/dirtree-files it)
         it))
    (-flatten)))

(defun project-occur (buffer thing)
  "Find THING with `multi-occur' in BUFFER's project."
  (interactive
   (list (current-buffer) (thing-at-point 'symbol)))
  (when thing
    (with-current-buffer buffer
      (let* ((dir
              (file-name-directory 
               (locate-dominating-file
                (buffer-file-name)
                (lambda (dirname)
                  (and (file-directory-p dirname)
                       (directory-files
                        dirname nil "\\(\\.git\\|node_modules\\)$"))))))
             (files (project-occur/dirtree-files dir "node_modules"))
             (buffers (--map (find-file-noselect it) files)))
        (multi-occur buffers thing)))))

;;; project-occur.el ends here
}}}

The functional style works very well and I wish we could include this stuff in core Emacs. Sadly Magnars thinks he already lost control of the contributors so would be unable to get copyright assignment.

=== Things with multi-occur ===
The reason multi-occur (and derivatives like this) are so useful is because you can put it into edit mode and change a lot at once. All the Emacs tool's then become more useful, you can do search and replace, record a macro, even use multiple-cursors.

Here's a screenshot of my Emacs with multi-occur from a CSS file.
