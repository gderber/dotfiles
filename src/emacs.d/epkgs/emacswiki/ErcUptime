This ERC command will display the uptime of the system, as well as some load-related information that I know nothing about.  It will help the ERC user to keep up with those users of other IM clients.

<pre>
(defun erc-cmd-UPTIME (&rest ignore)
  "Display the uptime of the system, as well as some load-related
stuff, to the current ERC buffer."
  (let ((uname-output
         (replace-regexp-in-string
          ", load average: " "] {Load average} ["
          ;; Collapse spaces, remove
          (replace-regexp-in-string
           " +" " "
           ;; Remove beginning and trailing whitespace
           (replace-regexp-in-string
            "^ +\\|[ \n]+$" ""
            (shell-command-to-string "uptime"))))))
    (erc-send-message
     (concat "{Uptime} [" uname-output "]"))))
