As I keep my mails on an external hard disk, I've had to set `gnus-spotlight-mail-spool' to the value of my `nnml-directory'.

I had created a new server in the Server buffer using the following:

{{{
(nnml "mail"
      (nnml-directory "/Volumes/Extern/Archives/Mail")
      (nnml-active-file "/Volumes/Extern/Archives/Mail/active"))
}}}

Thus, the setting I needed was:

{{{
(setq gnus-spotlight-mail-spool "/Volumes/Extern/Archives/Mail")
}}}
