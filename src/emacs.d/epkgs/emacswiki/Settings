== Installation ==

To use without using a package manager:

* Put the library in a directory in the emacs load path, like ~/.emacs.d
* Add (require 'readme) in your ~/.emacs file
* If you have [http://www.marmalade-repo.org/ marmalade-repo.org], this readme is part of the emacs packges you can install.  Just type M-x package-install readme marmalade 

This is in emacswiki, so this package can also be installed using el-get.

After installing el-get, Type M-x el-get-install readme.
