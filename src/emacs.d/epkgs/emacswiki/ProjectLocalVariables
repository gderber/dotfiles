: **Similar functionality has been integrated into current Emacs.**
: See DirectoryVariables.

This file allows you to create .emacs-project files that are evaluated
when a file is opened. You may also create .emacs-project-$MODE files
that only get loaded when you open files of a specific mode in the
project. All files for which a .emacs-project file exists in an
ancestor directory will have it loaded.

I don't see this "Directory Variables" functionality in Aquamacs 1.5
(based on GNU Emacs 22.3.2), so I think that this Lisp file is still
relevant. Luckily it's provided via the [[ELPA]]. --MishaGorodnitzky

*Warning:* This is a severe security hole!  A .emacs-project file can
contain arbitrary Lisp code, which will be run automatically when you
try to open any file in that directory.  Unless you are on a
single-user system, and you never open files from people you don't
trust, /do not use this package/.  Consider using DirVarsPackage instead.

== Adding Project Variables ==

To add a project variable to you .emacs-project or .emacs-project-$MODE,
define it using the function 'setl':

    (setl ruby-indent-level 4)
