I'll not make this change directly since I'd prefer not to trample others' work, but this version of visws.el:

    http://pastebin.com/SCCLWDar

Makes the font face work in emacs 22.1.1 and 24.3.1.

It also hides newlines, which are usually implied by the lack of any characters, and changes the color of whitespace to make it clash less with the document.
