I use XEmacs.

My first UNIX editor was ed on a PDP11 back in 1985 at the University of NSW in Sydney, Australia.  Then I spent a year using vi on a VAX 780 (it was the only other editor available.  I still have nightmares).

I finally escaped to the Emacs editor family firstly with JOVE (Jonathan's Own Version of Emacs), again on the PDP11 and a 68k based BSD 4.2 box.  Then Emacs 18.X on Apollo workstations, then Epoch and finally XEmacs across a variety of UNIX boxes and jobs.

These days I'm on the XEmacs development review board and hack GTK, autoconf and miscellaneous bugs.
