This is an alternative to BufferMenu.  The only new thing is that hitting RET will bury the list and SPC will select the buffer.

I found it quite confusing when I tried it, though. -- AlexSchroeder

DanEspen, however, says the following:

I'm looking forward to the day when I can remove this from my .emacs:

 (global-set-key "\C-x\C-b" 'electric-buffer-list)

I can't see how making buffer-list the default binding
is in any way better.

What's so confusing about this when compared to BufferMenu ?? They
look the same to me, except for the fact that BufferMenu uses the
whole height of the screen while ElectricBufferList uses only the
minimum needed (which is a good thing IMHO). Also, this one highlights
the line where the cursor is, making it easier to use. -- AlbertoGarcia

Combined with font-locking, its pretty neat.
To set up font-locking, there are slight differences between
GNU Emacs and XEmacs.

First here is the XEmacs version:

 (defconst Electric-buffer-menu-mode-font-lock-keywords
   (purecopy
    (list
     '("^ MR Buffer.*"                 . font-lock-preprocessor-face) ;hdr 1
	'("^ -- ------.*"              . font-lock-preprocessor-face) ;hdr 2
	'("^\\(....Man: .*\\)" 1 font-lock-variable-name-face t) ;Manpg (new)
	'("^[. ][*][^%].[^*].*"        . font-lock-comment-face)	;Mod x temp
	'("^....[*]Buffer List[*].*"   . font-lock-doc-string-face) ;Buffer list
	'("^\\(....[*]shell.*\\)"      1 font-lock-reference-face t) ;shell buff
	'("^....[*].*"                 . font-lock-string-face) ;Temp buffer
	'("^....[+].*"                 . font-lock-keyword-face) ;Mail buffer
	'("^....[A-Za-z0-9/]*[-][+].*" . font-lock-keyword-face) ;Mail buffer
	'(".*Dired.*"                  . font-lock-function-name-face)
	)))

 ; This hook run after buffer formatted, so it is necessary to re-fontify it...
 (add-hook 'electric-buffer-menu-mode-hook
	   '(lambda ()
	      (font-lock-mode 1)
	      (font-lock-fontify-buffer)))

For the code for GNU Emacs, see BufferMenuHighlighting.
