top-mode.el can run the Unix program `top' from Emacs.

You can find it here: Lisp:top-mode.el

_Notice that top runs inside eshell flawlessly._

Nice mode, but lacks many features: face highliting (runnable tasks, own tasks, etc), choosing signal which to kill with, list of files opened by process (like in htop). -- IvanKorotkov
[new]

== Installation ==

Load it with `autoload' or `require'.
The enter

 M-x top-mode

or load it permanently with

 (top-mode 1)

in your emacs configuration file.

== Usage ==

Press `g' to run top and `q' to quit.
Other features are:

* strace a process
* kill processes
* renice processes

== Autorefresh ==
If you want this to auto-refresh like the shell's top, you might add the following to your .emacs. It binds the A key in top-mode to an interactive function. Set the refresh rate in seconds, and turn off by setting the refresh rate to 0.

Note that a refresh rate of 1 is not recommended, as the `top' function moves point to top's buffer. This leaves little time to render the prompt and let the user change the refresh rate in the minibuffer.

It would be nice if `top' updated its buffer without moving point, so you could have top in one buffer and work in another.

 (defun top-auto-refresh (rate)
   (interactive "nTop refresh rate (seconds): ")
   (progn
     (cancel-function-timers 'top)
     (if (not (zerop rate))
         (setq *top-refresh-timer*
               (run-with-timer 2 rate 'top)))))
 (define-key top-mode-map "A" 'top-auto-refresh)

== Use with Anything ==
'''[[Anything]]''' is a candidate selection framework.

Start with `M-x anything-top', narrow the top output by typing some patterns(multiple patterns are space-delimited string),
select with up/down/pgup/pgdown/C-p/C-n/C-v/M-v, Enter to kill.

C-z kills selected process without quitting anything session.

== Etop by Tom Wurgler ==

Lisp:etop.el provides command M-x etop to display top(1) output.
