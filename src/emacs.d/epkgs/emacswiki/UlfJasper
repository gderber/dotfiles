: Hallo und Willkommen. I really like the MandelBrot screenshots on your homepage. -- AlexSchroeder

:: Danke! And thanks for your work on the EmacsWiki. It's great! -- ulf

Many Thanks(tm) for the beautiful VM colorizer :-) -- StefanKamphausen

You write on another page that you do not dare to remove obsolete

they will resurrect it from the old revisions.
