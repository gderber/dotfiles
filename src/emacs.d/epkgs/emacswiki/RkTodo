rk-todo is not a major/minor mode but a very simple function to sort paragraphs according to their first words.  One can use the first word to denote something (priority, importance, urgency etc), and =RK-TODO-SORT= will sort accordingly.

You can limit the sortings effect via separators to a specific region, so it's possible to have a "todo section" in any file.

I wrote this because I did not want to use any todo modes but wanted to have todos in my EmacsWikiMode wiki files.

or grab the elisp file form http://ignotus.hixsplit.hu/stuff/rk-todo.el
