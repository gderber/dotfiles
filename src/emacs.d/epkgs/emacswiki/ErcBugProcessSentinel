You need something listening for TCP connections on port 9999 to run this test.  If you have netcat installed, do this: <b><tt>/bin/nc -l -p 9999</tt></b>

<pre>
(defun foo-sentinel (proc reason)
  (message ">> foo-sentinel: current-buffer is '%s'" (buffer-name))
  (if (not (buffer-live-p (process-buffer proc)))
      (message ">> foo-sentinel: process buffer is dead!")
    (with-current-buffer (process-buffer proc)
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (insert "\n>> foo-sentinel: " reason))))

(defun foo ()
  (setq foo
	(open-network-stream "foo" (current-buffer) "localhost" 9999)
	;;(start-process "foo" (current-buffer) "sleep" "40")
	)
  (set-process-sentinel foo 'foo-sentinel)
  (process-send-string foo "hello world\n"))


(defun foo-test ()
  (switch-to-buffer "yyy")
  (foo)
  (sit-for 5)
  (kill-buffer "yyy"))
