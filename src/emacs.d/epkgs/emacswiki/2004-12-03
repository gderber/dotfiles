To answer the question by PierreGaston on [[2004-12-01]]: no, me too.  I only get access today so that I could answer at all.  Yet, I do not know whether it was due to header problems, I got not pages at all.
[new:PierreGaston:2004-12-03 07:52 UTC] AlexSchroeder states on EmacsWikiProblems that there were problems with the apache server. seems ok now.
