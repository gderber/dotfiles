== Subject: IRC XEmacs Developer Channel has Opened ==
 
Fellow XEmacs Developers and Users!

Unnoticed by global media, IRC channel <strong>#xemacs</strong> hosted
by <strong>freenode.net</strong> has been officially registered on 28
April, 2004.

See the most recent XEmacs Community News item at
http://www.xemacs.org or one of its web mirrors
(http://www.dk.xemacs.org/Download/web-mirrors.html).

The XEmacs development team thanks Sebastian Freundt (hroptatyr on
freenode) for registering #xemacs and acting as #xemacs channel
operator.

Please use #xemacs to discuss development issues requiring developer
interaction.

One of the most popular IRC client in the Emacs community is ERC
(already an XEmacs package too).
