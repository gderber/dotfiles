*How to*

If you execute 'c-open-relational-file' when current buffer is 'test.h' and 'Open-Type' is 1, current buffer switches C source file('test.c')
And, if current buffer is 'test.c' and 'Open-Type' is 1, current buffer switches C header file('test.h')
You can select 1 or 2 for 'Open-Type'. If type is 1, current buffer switches relational file's buffer, and if type is 2, 
emacs splits window horizontally and the buffer on other-window switches relational file's buffer.
This supports c and c++.

*Modified version*

I was having trouble using the code posted above, so I made a few minor changes.  For one thing, I added support for Objective-C/C++ file extensions.  For another, I removed the regular expressions, which stripped out the directory information, and replaced them with the elisp functions for extracting the extension etc of a file-name. This seems to work more reliably for me.

 ;; Minor additions by Nicholas D. Matsakis:
 ;; - added "m" etc for obj. c files
 ;; - added (provide 'cOpenRelational) at the end
 ;; - modified to use emacs built-in functions for removing extension, etc,
 ;;   which preserves full path
