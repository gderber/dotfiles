== Introduction ==

The semantic idle breadcrumbs mode displays information about the structural context of point in the [HeaderLine header line] or [ModeLine mode line]. The display update is performed using [SemanticBovinator Semantic]'s idle scheduler. This means the update happens after a short period of inactivity.

The screenshot below illustrates one of the display styles in the header line for the C++, Python and Emacs Lisp programming languages:

== Usage ==

In recent versions of [[CEDET]], the mode can be enabled for individual buffers using the `semantic-idle-breadcrumbs-mode' command. The command is executed by typing

  M-x semantic-idle-breadcrumbs-mode RET

In addition, the mode can be enabled globally (meaning that the mode will automatically be enabled in all buffers) using `global-semantic-idle-breadcrumbs-mode'. To make the activation of this global mode permanent, the following code can be added to the Emacs startup file (usually `.emacs`)

  (global-semantic-idle-breadcrumbs-mode 1)

The display style can be customized in the `semantic' customization group.

=== Display Styles ===

* The context can be displayed in a traditional [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_%28navigation%29 "breadcrumbs"]] manner such that elements are displayed from left to right using an outermost to innermost order. Example:
{{{
outer_namespace::inner_namespace::class::member_function
}}}
* A variant of this style uses a configurable language-independent separator string. Example:
{{{
outer_namespace > inner_namespace > class > member_function
}}}
* It is also possible to display the innermost element with more detail followed by a "breadcrumbs" path. This style is shown in the screenshot above. Example:
{{{
void member_function (int a, int b) | outer_namespace::inner_namespace::class
}}}

Q: Could you specify how you achieved the format in the screenshot?

== Alternatives ==

An alternative mode that offers similar functionality for several programming languages is WhichFuncMode.
