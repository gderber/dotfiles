Gnus' Fancy Mail Splitting is a great feature, but it can be challenging to find that one mail coming in a few hours ago.

Lisp:gnuslog.el, when loaded, advises `nnmail-article-group' and puts header and splitting information into an nndoc group
of type gnuslog, from where each article can be accessed via M-x gnuslog-goto-destination-article.

Meanwhile it has become indispensible to me.

That and up-to-date swish-e index files of all my mail searchable via

    G G runs the command gnus-group-make-nnir-group

:-)

Fix long-standing issue where first nnmail-get-new-mail after startup
would be missed by gnuslog.

The fix is to put gnuslog-setup-hook onto gnus-read-newsrc-el-hook,
which is run before the initial nnmail-get-new-mail.

An error condition-case should be used in gnuslog-setup-hook for
correct error handling.
