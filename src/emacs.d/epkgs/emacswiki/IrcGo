This package lets you play go (igo/babuk/weiqi) over [[IRC]]. It supports the regular 2 player go as well as up to 8 player free for all play. Both a text mode and graphic tile board are available. The protocol is extremely simple. I imagine it would be very little work to make it work with another irc client.

Scoring doesn't work yet and it doesn't keep track of the number of captured stones. You'll have to do that yourself for now.

To run it, connect to the irc server with [[rcirc]]. In an rcirc buffer, `M-x irc-go-enable RET'. Now it will listen for new games. In the channel buffer you'd like to start a game in: `M-x irc-go-start-game RET'. Your opponent(s) must run: `M-x irc-go-join-game RET' to join the game.

To stop listening for games: `M-x irc-go-disable RET'. Note that while listening for games, irc-go will automatically observe all games played. Until recently anyone could place stones on the board, too. This may become a feature in the next release.

Enjoy.
