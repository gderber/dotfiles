Palm has put out a new device called the Palm Pre, running the Mojo Framework atop webOS.  Basically it is a browser-like os on your phone, running HTML 5, CSS 3, and Javascript.  The Mojo SDK has a suite of commandline tools to st up a base application, launchc the emulator, interact with the phone, etc.

Lisp:mojo.el is a set of interactive functions to help out with the development of a Mojo application.  Right now it is in its early alpha/beta phase, and could use more work.

Eventually I would like it to be easier to interact with the running emulator (i.e. provide completion for launching and deleting applications), and helping out with the build process (installing and launching the application, and maybe even interacting with it).

I'm also open to outside ideas and contributions.  If you fix bugs, or add functionality, just update it on emacswiki, and increment the version number.

Happy Hacking!

I've (sjs) made some significant changes and as such bumped the version to 0.9.x.  It's a fairly complete package for authoring Mojo applications, but I still have some ideas.

For an idea of what I've implemented check [http://github.com/samsonjs/mojo.el/blob/master/CHANGELOG the changelog on github], or just read the code.  There are comments explaining things at the top of mojo.el if you don't want to read the actual code.

So lots of fun new stuff!  Now all we have to do is run `mojo-package-install-and-inspect` when the current buffer is somewhere under the project's root and then switch to the emulator window.  There is still a lot of room for improvement, and please test this on Windows and Linux as I'm developing solely on Mac OS X these days.

My latest version will always be [http://github.com/samsonjs/mojo.el on github].  Don't hesitate to send a pull request or e-mail me.   -- sjs 2009-11-21
