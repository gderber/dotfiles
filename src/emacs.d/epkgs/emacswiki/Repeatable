repeatable.el helps with RepeatingCommands by being able to advise commands that are bound
to sequences with multiple keys by automatically repeating the command when the
last key stroke is successively hit.

An example should make this clear: after advising kmacro-end-and-call-macro
(bound to `C-x e'), you can call this command repeatedly -- the first
time with `C-x e' and with only `e' subsequently. After you press another
key, things are back to normal.

A clean implementation for emacs 24.x can be found on https://github.com/leoliu/repeatable.el
