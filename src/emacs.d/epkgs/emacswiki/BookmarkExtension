This page is about [http://mercurial.intuxication.org/hg/emacs-bookmark-extension/ bookmark-extensions]

This is a fork of bookmark+.el, but simpler to use (less commands).

Compatibility: Only emacs23+.

== Download ==

You can get it here with mercurial: 

<pre>

hg clone http://mercurial.intuxication.org/hg/emacs-bookmark-extension/

</pre>

To get the development branch:

<pre>

hg update -C Development

</pre>

== Features ==

* At the moment it provide support for bookmarking in W3m, Gnus, Woman, Man, Info with emacs standard bookmarks.

* You can import w3m bookmarks temporarily by using the w3m filter (W) in menu list with a prefix arg (C-u).

* You can import Delicious bookmarks temporarily with (D) a prefix arg will refresh the list from delicious.
NOTE: For this feature you will need Lisp:anything-delicious.el even if you don't use Anything.

* You can import Firefox bookmarks temporarily with (P).
NOTE: Firefox version>=3 don't use anymore html file to store bookmarks.
It use instead places.sqlite, an sql database.
bookmark-extensions.el use the bookmarks.html file to import firefox bookmarks.
To feed your bookmarks.html automatically, add this line in user.js (in ~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxx.default)

<pre>

user_pref("browser.bookmarks.autoExportHTML", true);

</pre>

Or set it to true with a doubleclick in about:config from firefox.

This will import automatically your firefox bookmarks from places.sqlite to bookmarks.html

* You can jump to your urls with external browser (e.g firefox) if you use a prefix arg (C-u RET). 

* The display is colorized to differency caregories of bookmarks.

* You will find filters to show only the category of bookmarks you want (e.g Gnus, W3m, etc...)

* You will find the support to use it in [[Anything]] in Lisp:anything-config.el
** `M-x anything-for-files'
** `M-x anything-bookmark-ext'

* It provide also an incremental searching of bookmarks ala [[Anything]].(no need to have [[Anything]] installed)
(That is now part of Emacs).

* Bookmarking a page from firefox in Emacs bookmarks is possible:

You will find files and instructions in contrib directory.

You will have to add protocol handlers to firefox to make that working:

That is not so easy as it was in firefox version < 3 due to a bug in firefox3+ i think.

I will add infos when i know more about that. See [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=529511 Bug 529511]

You can also have infos about that on the org mailing list.

For the moment you will have to hack file in firefox: mimeTypes.rdf in addition of the usual user.js.

You will find some code to setup protocols in Firefox in the contrib directory (firefox-protocol.el), but that is
experimental (use with care) though that work fine for me here to setup my protocols.

* Org support: You will also find command `bmkext-firefox2org' to send your firefox bookmarks to an org file.

* Bookmark-extensions have now his own addressbook, that can be a replacement of bbdb.

You should use an image host which allows full size images, so if you click on the thumbnall a new page is opened with the full size pictures. Or you could link the images to the full images on Flickr.

These screenshots are pretty much useless, because you only see a very vague color outline of things. If a new user comes here they are not very helpful to present what these features actually look like during use.

: Thanks for the links to the full screen pictures. I wish it would be a policy on Emacs Wiki (to provide a link to the original picture), because I've seen ridiculously tiny screenshots on other pages too.

It would be great if you provided more information about the differences between bookmark-extensions vs. Bookmark+.el.
As of now, it is hard to tell what kind of advantages bookmark-extensions provides over Bookmark+.el.

[new]
I don't want to make comparison between bookmark+ and bookmark-extensions, just look at the features provided above and make your own idea,
or better try one and the other.
