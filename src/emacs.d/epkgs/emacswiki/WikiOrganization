[[es:OrganizaciónDeLaWiki]]
[[ja:Wikiの組織方法]]
[[zh:Wiki结构]]
The entire organization of the wiki is hand written.
We use both a top-down approach (also known as a [MeatBall:ForwardIndex forward index])
and a bottom-up approach (also known as a [MeatBall:ReverseIndex reverse index]).

# The SiteMap links to some high-level category pages.
# The category pages link to all pages in the category.
# Every page ''should'' link to the category pages it belongs to.

When pages have "parent" pages or belong to a certain category explicit backlinks
are added manually.  Add the
appropriate parent or category tag by referring to it in the page or place it at the end of the page.  The
backlinks can be searched for, automatically.  Just click on the
header to list all other pages linking to your current page.  This is
just a plain ol' regular search.

This usually looks like the end of a page:

    ----
    CategoryFoo

The reason this is not all automated is because a) it would require
the maintenance of a separate link database, and b) in a double linked graph
there may be potentially a lot of irrelevant pages pointing to the
current page, so you do not always want to list them.  Thus, the
manual strategy of adding category tags or parent pages at the end.
