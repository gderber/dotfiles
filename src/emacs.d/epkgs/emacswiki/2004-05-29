We have a visitor from the
Czech Republic right now
who is trying to download the entire site using wget...
Over 50% of all requests are from 213.211.33.17.
They are spaced over five seconds appart, so I can't really argue with it.

Next time, dear leech, consider just downloading the '''tarball'''
from the link on the SiteMap (look for "Download the page database -- help making decentralized backups"):

On the EmacsChannel:

<pre>
12:38 <@kensanata> i wonder who in the czech republic is using the swedisch emacswiki script to 
                   leech the entire wiki...  
12:39 <@kensanata> oh no...
12:39 <@kensanata> i found that now he is using the japanese script to download the entire site 
                   *again*
12:39  * kensanata flatpalms forehead.

And on the WikiChannel:

<pre>
12:19 < ThomasWaldmann> kensanata: disallow wget ua - the more intelligent ones dont leech wikis
12:20 < kensanata> hm.
12:20 < kensanata> it would be nice to have a .htaccess rule that would automatically redirect to a 
                   static page...
12:21 < ThomasWaldmann> load is 1 currently
12:22 < kensanata> is this good or bad?
12:23 < ThomasWaldmann> a bit too high maybe, but no problem
12:24 < kensanata> i just fixed my leech-detector script.
12:24 < kensanata> he is hitting every 5.25 seconds on average.
12:24 < kensanata> that seems reasonable, in fact.
12:24 < kensanata> (even if leeching a wiki is bogus)
12:25 < kensanata> specially since i provide a download for the pagedatabase.
12:25 < ThomasWaldmann> maybe provide a html dump
12:28 < kensanata> yeah.  
12:28 < kensanata> i will have to write a cron-job that does it for me.
12:28 < kensanata> (the function to provide an html dump was being abused a week ago, remember?)

The little leech detector script availabe from my homepage. [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/alex/WebServerLogs] -- AlexSchroeder

'''Later:''' I created this page 09:59 UTC, and now, 22:21 UTC, this guy is still at it.  Compare this to the few minutes it would have taken him to download the entire page database...  Unbelievable...

<pre>
aschroeder@thinkmo:~$ cat /org/org.emacswiki/logs/access.log | leech-detector | head -1 | cut -b -80
       213.211.33.17      10526  43%    6.1s  200 (96%), 404 (2%), 302 (1%), 304
</pre>

That's IP, hits, percentage of all hits, average time between hits, and HTTP status codes...
