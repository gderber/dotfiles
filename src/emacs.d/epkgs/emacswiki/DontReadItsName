== Hide Obscene Content in Gnus ==

Very similar and working in gnus articles:

  (defface you-know-who-face
    '((((type x w32 mac))
       (:height 0.8 :foreground "Grey50"
	        :box (:line-width -1 :color "Grey50" :style nil))))
    "Face used for You-know-who.")
               
  (defun you-know-who-hide-obscene-content ()
    (when (display-graphic-p)
      (while (re-search-forward "\\<g?vim?\\>" nil t)
        (compose-region
         (match-beginning 0)
         (match-end 0)
         [?n (tl . Bl) ?H (Br . Bl) ?o (tr . tr) ?e
             (Br . Bl) ?t (tr . tr) ?\  (Br . Bl) ?\  (tr . tr) ?w
             (Br . Bl) ?b (tr . tr) ?h (Br . Bl) ?e (tr . tr) ?o
             (Br . Bl) ?\  (tr . tr) ?\  (Br . Bl) ?n (tr . tr) ?m
             (Br . Bl) ?a (tr . tr) ?u (Br . Bl) ?m (tr . tr) ?s
             (Br . Bl) ?e (tr . tr) ?t (Br . Bl) ?d
             ])
        (put-text-property (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)
                           'face 'you-know-who-face))))
        
  (add-hook 'gnus-article-prepare-hook
            'you-know-who-hide-obscene-content)

Put it in the <tt>~/.gnus</tt> of your children to protect
them from all the evil and nasty stuff on the net.

== Discussion ==

Why do we treat <tt>vim</tt> this way?  We don't try to hide ordinary words like <tt>dog</tt> or <tt>trash</tt>.  Historically we have tried to hide <tt>Yahweh</tt>.  Words that are not to be spoken or seen are words of power.  We should stop giving <tt>vim</tt> this power, and treat it like <tt>trash</tt>.

[new]
You forget the religious way of thinking.  The Evil Adversary (with capitals) is always unspeakable, intolerable, and un-named as to not soil one's tongue by uttering A Filthy Name (again, with capitals), and to not call The Evil One's attention upon oneself by accident.
Yes, stupid, but that's religion for you…
