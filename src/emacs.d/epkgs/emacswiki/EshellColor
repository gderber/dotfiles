When your ls emits ANSI color escape sequences in eshell, then you're not calling the builtin eshell/ls.  This usually happens when you use command-line parameters not handled by the builtin.  Some init files will alias 'ls' to 'ls --color=yes', for example.

In order for eshell to understand these commands, you have to add an output filter.  You can do this with CVS Emacs (as of 2008-09-28) by customizing eshell-output-filter-functions or by adding the following to your .emacs:

    (require 'ansi-color)
    (require 'eshell)
    (defun eshell-handle-ansi-color ()
      (ansi-color-apply-on-region eshell-last-output-start
                                  eshell-last-output-end))
    (add-to-list 'eshell-output-filter-functions 'eshell-handle-ansi-color)

This should no longer be necessary in Emacs 23+.
