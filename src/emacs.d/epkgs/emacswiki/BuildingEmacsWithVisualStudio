You can build Emacs cleanly with Visual Studio 6.0 as well.  There is
one issue with the CVS GNUEmacs -- configure.bat seems to generate
extra ^Ms at the end of makefiles generated.  Use an editor to rip out
those ^Ms before attempting building the sources.  The makefiles you
need to change are here:

* emacs\src
* emacs\nt
* emacs\lib-src
* emacs\lisp
* emacs\leim

With Emacs as editor, you can just do M-% C-q C-m RET RET ! to get rid
of all ^ Ms.

I can't seem to get the cvs source finish - it fails with a return
code of 0xffffffff when temacs.exe is attempting to dump.  I wondered
about the path to temacs.exe - which contained both \'s and /'s, but
fiddling with that didn't seem to matter.

I removed the extraneous ^M's, but that didn't help.

environment:
: hardware: P4, 128 megs ram
: OS: XP
: devl: DevStudio+sp5, CygWin, WinDbg

any suggestions?
