`M-x enriched-mode' is just like text mode.  With one crucial
difference: When you add [[Face]]s to the text, this information gets
saved as RFC 1896 <code>text/enriched</code> format markup (with an Emacs-specific <code>Content-Type</code> tag at the start).

Read about enriched mode in the Emacs manual, at [[Manual:Enriched mode]] (<code>C-h i m emacs RET m Formatted Text RET</code>).

== Example ==

Use `M-g b' to add the bold face to some text, such that it
looks like this:

: *This is bold*.  This is not.

Then use `M-x enriched-mode' and save.  If you reload your file, the
bold text will still be bold.  If you use `M-x find-file-literally',
however, you can see how Emacs saved the face information:

 Content-Type: text/enriched
 Text-Width: 70
 
 <bold>This is bold</bold>.  This is not.

== Development ==

: ''In the future, we plan to implement other formatting features as well.''
::: Stallman et al, ''GNU Emacs Manual''.  Fourteenth edition.  2002.

EnrichedMode is an initial attempt to provide the Emacs text editor with WordProcessing
capabilities.  The early system has generic formatting features and will later 
be able to input and output numerous enriched file formats.

In September 2004, there was a post on the emacs-devel about
[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2004-09/msg00114.html enriched-mode and switching major modes]
which evolved into a discussion on the future of EnrichedMode.

=== Problems ===

This doesn't seem to work on XEmacs. Does anybody know how to find  
literally in XEmacs?

When I try to print enriched buffers (either from GNU Emacs or from
XEmacs) the background color (as in highlighting) is lost. All other faces information seems to 
be preserved. Any ideas?  

Try `M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces'.  Works for me in GNU Emacs 23.
