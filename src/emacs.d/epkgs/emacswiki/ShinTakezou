'''Real name''': Mauro Panigada (label "programmer" to avoid to be confused with a homonym); usually I use ShinTakezou on the net, and few other nicks. I use Emacs and I like it, even though I am sometimes lost in configuration nightmare. Maybe a day I will write more and better words for this page.
