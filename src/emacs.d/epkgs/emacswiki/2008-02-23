It seems to me that some spammers are able to bypass the question Emacs Wiki is asking. In order to check whether they discovered the "secret" or whether this spam is typed by humans, I've changed the secret. If you use OddmuseMode, you know where to look... :)

I'm assuming the spammers are not actually _reading_ our news. If they are, we'll have to think of something else.
