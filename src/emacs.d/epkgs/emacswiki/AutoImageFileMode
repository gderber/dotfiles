Note: GNU Emacs 22 has ImageMode, a new major mode which is the 
default for viewing images.

Use M-x auto-image-file-mode to enable Emacs to open graphic files
such as JPEG or PNG format files.  Whether Emacs is able to display a
certain file format depends on your installation -- Emacs must have
been compiled with the correct options (or it must have detected the
libraries at configuration time).

The code that does this is also used by Gnus, for example, to inline
MIME attachments of the correct format.

<code>auto-image-file-mode</code> works by turning any insert-file of an 
image into an image display property.  This is a little bit scary, depending 
what sort of things you normally do with insert file.

21.2.50 already supports PBMs and XBMs... Excellent! -- GirishB

So, when do we this extended to use aalib for console mode viewing? :-) --ShaeErisson

How do you show an image (PNG, JPEG, GIF) in Emacs 21.2, like it does on the intro screen? Can you make the image auto-load when a text file is loaded? I am using Linux, X, and have Emacs 21.2 (not XEmacs). -- LionKimbro

:: Thanks! I've opened images with auto-image-mode, and even copy/pasted them into buffers. However, now I am trying to save the buffers, and restore the images. I save them under a format called something like "emacs-mule", or something like that, but when I load it back up, the image is just a bunch of line noise. I have tried to revert the format to "emacs-mule", or whatever it was, but cannot figure out how to do it. Do you know how to do that? When I figure this all out, I plan to add a Wiki entry for it. =^_^= Thanks; LionKimbro.

Does Emacs 21.2 support viewing of any images (BMP,XBM,ICO,PNG...) on Windows?

If you want to save a text file with images you need a new file format. MULE is used for non-Ascii text encodings, not for images. Normally Emacs will save only the text of a buffer, not its overlays (colors, fonts, etc.). You can re-attach an image to the text file by creating an overlay with the <code>'display</code> property on it (see AutoSmiley for an example package that adds images to a text file). --AmitPatel
