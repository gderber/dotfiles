Lisp:devel-notes.el 

== Overview ==
This library provides an easy way of adding annotations to source files and track them in an org file.

This is my first serious attempt to program something useful in emacs lisp, so don't expect the code to be brilliant.


== Installing ==
To install this library, save this file to a directory in your `load-path' (you can view the current `load-path' using "C-h v load-path RET" within Emacs), then add the following line to your .emacs startup file:

    (require 'devel-notes)


== Using ==
To add an annotation to a source file run the command `develnotes-add-annotation', this will let you choose the type and comment for the annotation, and it will also be saved in `develnotes-file'.
In case there isn't such file you will be prompted the base directory where to create it.

Note there are more `develnotes-add-TYPE' commands, look at `develnotes-types-list' variable to find out existing options.

You can create the file `develnotes-file' manually running `develnotes-create-file'.

To visit `develnotes-file' file in current window, run `develnotes-visit-file', execute with a C-u to open in other window.


== Customizing ==
You can configure some variables to customize the package behaviour.

* `develnotes-file': name of the `devel-notes' tracking file, default: "TODO.org".
* `develnotes-types-list': list of accepted types for entries, defaut: ("TODO" "FIXME" "BUG" "WARNING" "NOTE" "HACK" "XXX").
* `develnotes-timestamp-format': tTimestamp format, default "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M".


== Key map Examples ==

  (global-set-key "\C-cza" 'develnotes-add-annotation)
  (global-set-key "\C-czv" 'develnotes-visit-file)
  (global-set-key "\C-czt" 'develnotes-add-TODO)
  (global-set-key "\C-czf" 'develnotes-add-FIXME)


== TODO and known problems ==
* why tags are not aligned properly?
* add-entry-into-develnotes-file: timestamp as org-timestamp, as org-property?
