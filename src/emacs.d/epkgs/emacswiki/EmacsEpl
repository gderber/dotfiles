It seems that you can use Perl in a similar way as Python as an
extension language (see PyMacs).  beppu (Journeyer) wrote in his essay
"Transcending Language Bias in Scriptable Applications"
[http://www.advogato.org/article/550.html], that a perl module called
`Emacs::EPL` exists.  The Perl interpreter is executed as a subprocess,
and interprocess communications between the two is
accomplished via pipes.  It seems, however, that this does not free
you from using Lisp -- much like PyMacs, you still need to know the
One True Programming Language -- EmacsLisp.

Experiences, anyone?

== documentation ==

The actual documentation for what Emacs::EPL can do:
[http://search.cpan.org/src/JTOBEY/Emacs-EPL-0.7/doc/epl.html epl.info (in html form)]

== non-standard installation proceedure ==

The installation proceedure is unusual for a perl module, and it's essential to read the 
[http://search.cpan.org/src/JTOBEY/Emacs-EPL-0.7/README README] file carefully.

== automated install is broken: "make test" stage is buggy ==

At present, installation of [http://search.cpan.org/~jtobey/ Emacs::EPL]
is reported to be failing on many popular platforms according to [http://cpantesters.perl.org/author/JTOBEY.html cpantesters.perl.org].

It's possible that these reports are misleading, however, because the test platforms may simply not have emacs installed and configured correctly.

The "make test" stage fails at present on Kubuntu GNU/Linux on AMD64, 
using perl 5.8.7 with GNU Emacs 21.4.1 (With "M-x server-start" done manually, 
though it's not clear if that should matter).

It hangs after displaying the error message:

   exec: No such file or directory at /home/doom/End/Slot/Emacs-Perl/Emacs-EPL-0.7/blib/lib/Emacs/EPL.pm line 671.

As a result of these difficulties, automated installation of Emacs::EPL (e.g. using CPANPLUS) essentially doesn't work.
