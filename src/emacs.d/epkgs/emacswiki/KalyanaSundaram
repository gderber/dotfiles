Hi, I am Kalyanasundaram. I used to hangout with the name [::kalyan] 
in the #emacs and other channels.

I use GNU emacs and I recently become addictive to the emacs.

I generally keep changing things regularly (desktop, applications, themes).

Including my desktop physical place itself.

I rotate the following like

* gnome-kde-windowmaker-enligtenment-gnome-..
* pidgin-kopete-pidgin-
* thunderbird-evolution-thunderbird-

After using emacs I could not go back to the other applications.

Because Emacs itself does provide me every change that keeps me not to feel bore.

I use
* [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/ColorTheme ColorTheme] 
* [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/icicles.el icicle] 
* [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Conkeror Conkeror] 
* [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/ERC ERC] 
* [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Gnus Gnus] 
* xcscope, dired+, highlight, and few more I use.

Now started understanding elisp code little bit.
