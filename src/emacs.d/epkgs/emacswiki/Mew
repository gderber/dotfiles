Mew is yet-another mail reader for emacs.

Homepage: http://www.mew.org/

== Setup ==

To install: download and unpack, run ./configure && make && make install. Initial setup is done in .emacs. Main configuration file for mew is ~/.mew.el, which is loaded //after// mew is started.  If you use emacs 23, you should use at least Mew version 6.2.52 (beta).

~/.emacs:

 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
 ;; mew -- mail
 (autoload 'mew "mew" nil t)
 (autoload 'mew-send "mew" nil t)
 ;; Optional setup (Read Mail menu for Emacs 21):
 (if (boundp 'read-mail-command)
     (setq read-mail-command 'mew))
 ;; Optional setup (e.g. C-xm for sending a message):
 (autoload 'mew-user-agent-compose "mew" nil t)
 (if (boundp 'mail-user-agent)
     (setq mail-user-agent 'mew-user-agent))

== Fixing problem with sending mail ==

In versions 6.1 and 6.2 I found that I can't send email because of very strange error: draft file was meant to be renamed to +queue, but was deleted before renaming. I wrote to the author, but he didn't reply.

So if you have such a problem, just add this to you .mew.el:
                                                                          
 ;; bugfix                                                                                        
 ;; draft was deleted before it could be renamed to +queue                                        
 ;; redefine that function to fix this                                                            
 (defun mew-encode-save-draft ()                                                                  
   (mew-frwlet mew-cs-dummy mew-cs-text-for-write                                                 
     (write-region (point-min) (point-max) (buffer-file-name) nil 'no-msg)                        
     (clear-visited-file-modtime)                                                                 
     ;;;(mew-delete-file buffer-auto-save-file-name)     ; delete draft too early?                  
     (set-buffer-modified-p nil)))                                                                

== BBDB integration ==

For Mew to make use of the [BbdbMode bbdb], you need to add [Lisp:bbdb-mew.el bbdb-mew.el] to emacs' load-path.  Then add the following code to your init-file:
{{{
(autoload 'bbdb-insinuate-mew      "bbdb-mew"   "Hook BBDB into Mew")
(add-hook 'mew-init-hook 'bbdb-insinuate-mew)
(setq bbdb-send-mail-style 'mew)
}}}

*The way bbdb-mew works:*

From http://mew.iijlab.net/ml/mew-int-3.1/msg00140.html

* In the bbdb buffer entering "m" in the address will open a mew draft with the To: field filled in.
* Entering ";" in the summary should prompt to create a new bbdb record.

If you also want bbdb to do the tab-completion of e-mail adresses in draft composition buffers, [CategoryCustomize customize] Mew's variables /mew-field-completion-switch/ (for "<tab>" completion) and/or /mew-field-expansion-switch/ (for "M-<tab>" completion).  You can replace all occurances of mew-complete-address by bbdb-complete-name.

== Stunnel integration on Windows XP/32 ==

By default, Mew 6.3 does not work with [http://www.stunnel.org/download/binaries.html Stunnel 4.33] under Windows XP/32. A quick'n'dirty workaround is modifying <tt>mew-ssl.el</tt>:

* Comment out four lines in the function <tt>mew-ssl-options</tt>:

        (insert "client=yes\n")
        ; (insert "pid=\n")
        (insert (format "verify=%d\n" (mew-ssl-verify-level case)))
        ; (insert "foreground=yes\n")
        (insert "debug=debug\n")
        ; (if (>= mew-ssl-minor-ver 22)
        ; (insert "syslog=no\n"))
        (insert "CApath=" (expand-file-name (mew-ssl-cert-directory case)) "\n")

* Replace the function <tt>mew-ssl-setup</tt>, hard coding Stunnel's version numbers:

        (defun mew-ssl-setup ()
          (setq mew-ssl-ver 4)
          (setq mew-ssl-minor-ver 33))

== RFC2047 ==

-----

To send attachment using rfc2047 encode the mew header, patch the mew-header.el by modifying function mew-header-insert like this(in mew6.3.50 beta):
<pre>
(defvar *mew-header-encoding-method* :rfc2047)
(defun mew-header-insert (key value &optional no-fold)
  (if (and value (stringp key))
      (let ((beg (point)) params med parname parval)
        (when (listp value)
          (setq params (cdr value))
          (setq value (car value)))
        (insert key)
        (insert " ")
        (setq med (point))
        (if (string-match "^[\t -~]*$" value)
            (insert value)
          (mew-header-encode-text value nil (length key)))
        (dolist (par params)
          (mew-set '(parname parval) par)
          (insert ";")
          (cond
           ((string-match "^[-a-zA-Z0-9]+$" parval)
            ) ;; do nothing
           ((and (string= (mew-charset-guess-string parval) mew-us-ascii)
                 (not (string-match "\"" parval)))
            (setq parval (concat "\"" parval "\"")))
           (t
            (case *mew-header-encoding-method*
              (:rfc2047
               (when (loop for c across parval
                        thereis (> c 255))
                 (setq parval (concat "\"" (rfc2047-encode-string parval)
                                      "\""))))
              (t (setq parval (mew-param-encode parval))
                 (setq parname (concat parname "*"))))))
          (insert " " parname "=" parval))
        (insert "\n")
        (unless no-fold
          (mew-header-fold-region beg (point) med)))))

== Other stuff ==

To view Html messages in Message Mode, you can either install w3m etc, or insert the following in your .mew.el :
<pre>
(setq mew-prog-text/html 'etk-mime-text/html)
(defun etk-mime-text/html (begin end)
    (save-excursion 
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (shell-command-on-region begin end "html2text -nobs" nil t)
        )
    )
</pre>

-----

Is there a way to let mew remember the password for a pop3 account? I already set the timeout rather high and activited caching.
<pre>
(setq mew-use-cached-passwd t)
(setq mew-passwd-timer-unit 1000)
</pre>
But I want to save it in my .emacs, so it don't need to retype it, when I startup  emacs.

A:
You can.
<pre>
(setq mew-passwd-alist '(("username@ringding.cs.umd.edu:imap" "password" 0)))
</pre>
Found on http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nakamura/misc/mew_imap.html 

-----

To use different signature file for different Email address, include following line in each account's setting
<pre>
("signature-file" . "/location/of/signature")
</pre>

-----
I create [http://zhangw.com/emacs/dotmewel.html a list of .mew.el] (i.e. the configuration file of Mew) on [http://zhangw.com/ my website]

<b>Fighting Spam: bogofilter in Mew</b>
Sven Hartrumpf offers another way to use Bogofilter in Mew. (http://pi7.fernuni-hagen.de/hartrumpf/bogofilter_in_mew.html)


* Installing

Install a recent version of Mew and bogofilter. Then create a script called bogo containing the following lines: 
<pre>
#!
bogofilter -v -T -B $* | grep -e ' S ' -e ' U '
</pre>
(Leave out -e ' U ' if you don't want to mark messages classified by bogofilter as unsure.) Add to your .emacs (or .emacs.mew or similar Emacs' init file): 
<pre>
(setq mew-prog-grep "bogo")
</pre>

* Training the classifier

Type ls on spam message (in Mew's summary mode). (ls stands for learn spam.) Type lh on ham message (in Mew's summary mode). (ls stands for learn ham.) 

* Using the spam classifier

In Mew, press "?". bogo will be presented as the default program, so just press return when shown. This will mark spam (and unsure, see above) messages. Then put delete mark on all marked messages: md Later: press x (to delete really).
