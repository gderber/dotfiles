This is the home of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_Advanced_Command_Language Guardian/NSK]  support for Emacs.##  ##
It's FreeSoftware.

If you arrived at this page thru a link or search engine you may not
know:

Emacs is (arguably? Not really!) the most powerful text editor in the
world.##  ##See the following for information on this site and Emacs.

* SiteMap,  
* http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/
* http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.emacs

If you are looking for ports there is a Guardian OSS port listed under
CategoryPorts.##  ##This page is for user level stuff.

There is a Wish List at the bottom of this page.  You now might add a wish
that anyone will ever read it ;-)

*The main things NSK users want that Emacs doesn't supply out-of-the-box.*

# A way to remotely open files residing on an NSK machine from within Emacs.

# Highlighting and imenu support for proprietary languages like TAL, Tacl and DDL.

# A way to automatically recognize the language of files without name.extensions

If you'd like to help with creation of additional Tandem support
[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Rick_Bielawski *PLEASE CONTACT
ME*].##  ##Help is most welcome because I'm no longer in a position 
to work on these modes any more although I'll help you if you ask.

==What's available here==

* AngeFtp## ...... ##Emacs will FTP files automatically.##  ##
  Guardian/NSK host support has been added to this copy of
  [http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/ange-ftp.el.gz ange-ftp.el].##  ##
  [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/TandemNskSupport#ange-ftp
  See below] for more info.

* TalMode## ...... ##Fully functional programming mode including
  automatic indenting and popup help for function calls (ElDoc).

* TaclMode## ..... ##Now has all the same features as tal-mode
  except magic indenting.

* [[DDLMode]]## ..... ##Is quite useable now.##  ##No ElDoc yet.

* EnformMode## ... ##Basic stuff like comments & keywords are
  now working.##  ##Try it!

* CobolMode ##....##
  I've posted 2 versions.## ## Both are fairly useable.##  ##
  One is for ?ANSI style and the other is for ?TANDEM format.

* efs## ........... ##This had Guardian support that was fairly
  useable although no where near as good as the ange-ftp support
  above.##  ##I used it under 21.2.##  ##I'm not sure of it's status 
  lately.

* <nowiki>AciMakeMode</nowiki>## . ##Does not do much but I use
  it.##  ##Try the standard makefile-mode.##  ##It flags
  #loc as a comment but otherwise it does pretty good.

* <nowiki>GensimMode</nowiki>## .. ##Only does basic highlighting.
  ##  ##Email [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Rick_Bielawski  
  me] if you have color withdrawls editing Gensim files since it's
  not posted here.

For the sake of search engine indexing I'll mention that this page is a
  good source for Emacs support for Tandem, Guardian, NSK
  proprietary languages such as TAL, pTAL, Scobol, DDL, TGAL, TForm,
  Enform and TACL.##  ##Support includes syntax highlighting,
  automatic indentation, symbol identification and all the other features
  for which Emacs is famous.##  ##Sorry, I never got around to the Tedit
  emulation.##  ##I really had some grand hopes.

[:ange-ftp]
===ange-ftp for Guardian NSK===

I started out using EFS because it contained Guardian/NSK support.## ##
  It had some problems and I planned on trying to fix them but once I
  discovered that EFS doesn't work at all with Emacs 22.0.50 I shifted
  focus toward making AngeFtp handle Guardian/NSK.## ## My version of
  [http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/ange-ftp.el ange-ftp.el] has 'fully'
  functional Guardian/NSK support.## ## Since 22.0.50 was not a stable
  release mine might be out of sync but it should be a nit to re-sync
  them.

Either version of Ange-ftp *should* work out-of-the-box for the OSS
  environment but I never tried it.## ## My version just adds extensions
  to support Guardian NSK.## ## It should not change the behavior of
  ange-ftp on other hosts, including OSS.## ## My version won't work
  with 21.4 or prior versions of Emacs.## ## Last I tried, EFS worked on
  the 21.2 version of Emacs.## ## It's NSK access was quirky but useable.

[:language-recognition]
===Auto Tandem Language Recognition===

The following is an example of code you can put in your .emacs to
  recognize language.##  ##This is often necessary since there
  are no filename extensions on Tandem and many coders don't have the
  option of putting a -*-tal-*- type comment in line 1.##  ##This
  doesn't even attempt to recognize all cases but it shows a way you can
  create recognition for files you access most often.

=== Creating bookmarks for subvols ===
Since NSK ftp can't return a list of subvols on a volume, you may want a 
convenient way to generate a bookmark file containing subvols.##  ##Here
is a TACL macro that creates such a file

<pre>
?TACL ROUTINE

== EmacsVol <ange-ftp prefix> <subvol-template> <filename>
==
== This routine creates a file suitable for use by EMACS as a bookmark file.
== It creates a bookmark entry for every subvol matching the template you
== supply.  <filename> is the name of the bookmark file to be created.
==
== <ange-ftp prefix> Takes the following form.  Where you supply your USERID
==                   and the target system's IP-address for use by ange-ftp.
==
==                   /ftp:<userid>@<ip-address>:
==
== For Example
== EMACSVOL  /ftp:MY.ID@10.27.140.21: $DATA1.* DATA1BMK
==
== NOTE: ALL PARTS OF <ange-ftp prefix> ARE CASE SENSITIVE!

#frame
  #push :fname :subvol :bookmarks :template :prefix :outfile
  #if [#argument/value :prefix/word/space/]
  #if [#argument/value :template/subvoltemplate]
  #if [#argument/value :outfile/filename/syntax/]
  
  #set    :bookmarks ;;;; Emacs Bookmark Format Version 1 ;;;;
  #append :bookmarks ;;; This file was generated by EmacsVol TACL macro ;;;
  #append :bookmarks ;;; -*- End Of Bookmark File Format Version Stamp -*-
  #append :bookmarks (
  
  == THE ?* INSURES WE SKIP $VOL.#0000000 TEMP FILES
  #charins :template ([#charcount :template] - 1) ?

  #set :fname [#filenames/maximum 1/[:template]]
  [#loop
    |while| not [#emptyv :fname]
    |do|
      #set :subvol [#charget :fname 1 to ([#charfindr :fname 100 .] - 1)]
      #append :bookmarks ~_ ("[:subvol]"
      [#if [#match \* [:subvol]]
        |then| #set :fname /[#charget :subvol 2 for 100]
        |else| #set :fname [:subvol]
      ]
      VCHANGE/QUIET/:fname "$" "$$" {PROBABLY UNNECESSARY BUT BE SAFE}
      #append :bookmarks ~_   ((filename . "[:prefix][:fname]")
      #append :bookmarks ~_    (position . 1)))
      #set :fname [:subvol].ZZZZZZZZ
      #set :fname [#filenames/previous [:fname],maximum 1/[:template]]
  ]
  #append :bookmarks )
  VCHANGE/QUIET/:bookmarks "~_" " "

  == YOU MAY WANT TO DO THIS DIFFERENTLY, IT'S KIND OF DESTRUCTIVE!
  [#if [#fileinfo/existence/[:outfile]]
    |then| purge [:outfile]
  ]
  vartofile :bookmarks [:outfile]
#unframe
</pre>

==Wish List==
* True indent support for TACL.
* Better TAL indent support.
* Tgal file viewing/printing from Emacs.
* Tedit Emulation.
