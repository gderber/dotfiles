i've been using Emacs for only a few weeks. my editor has been always "vi" since i learned unix 20 years ago. i stumbled upon plannermode in http://sacha.free.net.ph and eventually into Emacs. now i'm trying to learn plannermode, elisp on my free time (if any). finally finished printing 208 pages of Emacs Lisp on a deskjet.

here's my ~/.emacs

    (setq visible-bell t)

    ;; (setq planner-use-other-window nil)
    ;; (setq planner-use-day-pages nil)
    ;; (setq planner-default-page nil)
    (setq planner-carry-tasks-forward t)
    ;; (setq planner-diary-use-diary t)
    ;; (setq planner-diary-create-section-flag t)
    ;; (setq planner-day-page-template "* Tasks\n\n\n* Schedule\n\n\n* Diary\n\n\n* Notes")

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs21/site-lisp/emacs-wiki/")
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs21/site-lisp/planner-el/")
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs21/site-lisp/w3-el/")

    ;; (add-hook 'diary-display-hook 'fancy-diary-display)

    (planner-insinuate-calendar)

    ;; Remember
    (add-to-list 'load-path '/usr/share/emacs21/site-lisp/remember/")
    (setq remember-annotation-functions planner-annotation-functions)
    (setq remember-handler-functions '(remember-planner-append))

    (require 'planner)
    ;; (require 'planner-diary)
    (require 'remember-planner)
    (require 'planner-cyclic)
    (require 'planner-tasks-overview)

    ;; Some keyboard mappings
    (global-unset-key (kbd "<f9>"))
    (global-unset-key (kbd "<f7>"))
    (global-set-key (kbd "<f9>" t SPC") 'planner-create-task-from-buffer)
    (global-set-key (kbd "<f9>" r SPC") 'remember)
    (global-set-key (kbd "<f9>" p SPC") 'planner-goto-today)
    (global-set-key (kbd "<f9>" P SPC") 'planner-goto)
    (global-set-key (kbd "<f7>" x SPC") 'planner-task-done)
    (global-set-key (kbd "<f7>" r SPC") 'planner-replan-task)
    (global-set-key (kbd "<f7>" n SPC") 'planner-task-note)
    (global-set-key (kbd "<f7>" u SPC") 'planner-update-note)

    ;; Start the day
    (plan)
