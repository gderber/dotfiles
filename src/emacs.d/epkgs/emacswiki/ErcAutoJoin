The autojoin module is enabled by default.  To disable it, use M-x customize-variable RET erc-modules.

This package allows us to customize an `erc-autojoin-channels-alist'.
As we /JOIN and /PART channels, this alist is updated to reflect our
current setup, so that when we reconnect, we rejoin the same channels.
The variable can be customized, so that the customized value will be used
when we reconnect in our next Emacs session.

Example setup:

    (setq erc-autojoin-channels-alist
          '(("freenode.net" "#emacs" "#wiki" "#nethack")))

If you want to automatically connect to freenode.net, add the following:

    (erc :server "irc.freenode.net" :port 6667 :nick "yournick")

For multiple channels on multiple servers:

    (setq erc-autojoin-channels-alist
          '(("freenode.net" "#emacs" "#wiki" "#nethack")
            ("oftc.net" "#bitlbee")))
    (erc :server "irc.freenode.net" :port 6667 :nick "yournick")
    (erc :server "irc.oftc.net" :port 6667 :nick "yournick")

Or if you'd like to join the same channels on any server:

    (setq erc-autojoin-channels-alist '((".*" "#help" "#emacs")))

== Problems with networks using servers without a common domain ==
[new]
Some servers, like Efnet, operate a round-robin system whereby connecting to efnet.net will in actual fact connect you to a random server from the pool. This will screw up autojoining, because unless the servers follow a common naming convention (like all Freenode servers ending in "freenode.net"), any regexp you put in the car of an entry in `erc-autojoin-channels-alist' won't necessarily get matched. To work around this, I just picked a server from Efnet's server list [http://www.efnet.org/?module=servers] and always connect to that server, rather than to the general efnet.net.

== Join after freenode hostname cloak is set ==
[new]
If you want to delay auto-joining until after freenode's hostname cloaking happens, see [http://edward.oconnor.cx/2007/09/freenode-cloaking-and-erc Freenode cloaking and ERC].
