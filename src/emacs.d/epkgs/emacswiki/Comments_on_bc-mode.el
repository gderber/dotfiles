I use bc and I need a bc-mode for Emacs.

I went looking, found this one, and downloaded and installed it.  It mostly works, but there are serious problems with the way comment formatting/layout is implemented.  It is bad enough that I can't see continuing to use this mode without finding a fix or a workaround.  There is next to nothing in the way of instructions for using bc-mode.el.

I note it relies on cc-mode.  That isn't much help for me.  I'm a longtime Emacs user, but not an Elisp hacker, and I don't understand very well how major modes work.  I am not a big-time C programmer, either, although I can write simple C programs when I must.  But I know almost nothing about cc-mode.el.

I tried to contact Kumar, the author, for help.  Well, it turns out that his supplied email address is nonexistent -- not very surprising, since the date on this code is 2005 -- thirteen long years ago!  There is no other way I can see to contact him, and no other person is mentioned.

So here is yet another sample of ancient, abandoned, nonworking and incorrect information that is just left to rot on the WWW.  I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for something useful, because Kumar's bc-mode.el isn't it as it stands right now.
