My website "The Notebook" is at http://dto.github.com/notebook/

I have written several things for GnuEmacs. 

* LinkdMode is a universal hyperlinker thing inspired by EevMode. http://dto.github.com/notebook/linkd.html
* RLX is a graphical roguelike engine with alpha transparency. http://dto.github.com/notebook/rlx.html 
* CellMode is a weird spreadsheet thing that I am currently rewriting. http://github.com/dto/cell-mode
* DTOX is a set of configurations for building a digital media authoring workstation centered around GnuEmacs. http://dto.github.com/notebook/Dtox.html
* org-publish.el adds website-publishing management support to OrgMode. It is part of the OrgMode distribution.
* I also have some ColorTheme themes at http://dto.github.com/notebook/ColorThemes.html
