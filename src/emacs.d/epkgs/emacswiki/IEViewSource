This page describes how to make emacs be Internet Explorer's "View Source" application (when *Source* is selected from IE's *View* menu).

==For Windows XP==

===Install GnuServ===
* Download and extract - GnuClient
* Add this to your InitFile (necessary because gnuclient.exe requires this initialization)
<pre>
          ; Run gnuserv, for view source, unless it's already running
          (require 'gnuserv)
          (unless gnuserv-frame
              (gnuserv-start)
              (setq gnuserv-frame (selected-frame)))
</pre>

===Create a batch file to run Emacs===

The View Source option in IE works by searching for the named program and appending the HTML source file's name to it.  If it can't find the file, it gives a "not found" error message and reverts to using Notepad.  Since gnuclientw.exe requires extra command line options just to open a file (which is insane, but what can you do?), you need a batch file to act as intermediary.

*Note:* This presumes you've installed your emacs using the [[EmacsW32]] installer, which makes Emacs 22 available for Windows well ahead of the game.  If not, adjust your paths to suit in the following batch file.

Create the following file as ##C:\Program Files\Emacs\emacs.bat##:

<pre>
  @echo off
  "c:\Program Files\Emacs\EmacsW32\bin\gnuclientw.exe" -sqF %*
</pre>

===Update your registry===

# Open regedit.exe

# Navigate to the key ("folder") ##HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer##

# If you do not have it already, create a key under it (right click -> New -> Key) called "View Source Editor".

# Open the new key you got and create another new key called "Editor Name" under it.

# In the (Default) string value on the right hand side in regedit, enter the following: ##C:\Program Files\Emacs\emacs.bat##
