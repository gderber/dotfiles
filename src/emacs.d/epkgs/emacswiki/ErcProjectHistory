= Original version of ERC =

Until the end of summer 2001, you could have gotten the original copy by
AlexanderBelikoff and SergeyBerezin from here:

* http://teapot.modck.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/erc/

: Sergey says, "First of all, I'm glad that my version of ERC is being used
out there.  The thing is, I do not have free time and enough incentive anymore
to work on ERC, so I would be happy if you guys take over the project
entirely."

And here is an even older one by AlexanderBelikoff:
