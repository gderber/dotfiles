If you don't have AUCTeX, you need a way to get an overview over your LaTeX document.
Here's some code that will show you the basic structure by using `occur' (see OccurBuffer) to search for all
sectioning commands.  These are then indented to help understand the basic layout.

<pre>
(defun latex-show-structure ()
  "Shows all sectioning commands.
These are the \\chapter{}, \\section{}, \\subsection{} and the
\\subsubsection{} command."
(interactive)
(occur "\\\\\\(chapter\\|\\(sub\\)*section\\)")
(pop-to-buffer "*Occur*")
;; Code adapted from texinfo.el, texinfo-show-structure
(goto-char (point-max))
(let ((margin 5)
      (buffer-read-only nil))
  (while (re-search-backward "^ *[0-9]*:" nil 0)
    (re-search-forward ":")
    (setq margin
	  (cond
	   ((looking-at "\\\\chapter") 5)
	   ((looking-at "\\\\section") 9)
	   ((looking-at "\\\\subsection") 13)
	   ((looking-at "\\\\subsubsection") 17)
	   (t margin)))
    (indent-to-column margin)
    (beginning-of-line))))
</pre>

Alternatively, when editing a latex document, you can run the command M-x imenu-add-menubar-index to give you a quick menu of your document headings.  Very nice, and you can even add it to the RefTeX hooks on load (you *do* use RefTeX and AUCTeX, don't you?):

<pre>
     (setq reftex-load-hook (quote (imenu-add-menubar-index)))
     (setq reftex-mode-hook (quote (imenu-add-menubar-index)))
</pre>
