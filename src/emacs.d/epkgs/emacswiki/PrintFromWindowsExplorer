After wrestling with this all afternoon, I think I've come up with a
decent way to print a file from Windows explorer using NTEmacs.  Any
comments/improvements would be welcome.  The following example
explains how to print a .txt file:

From Windows Explorer, go to Tools | Folder Options.  Select the File
Types tab.  Scroll down to the TXT extension and click on the
"Advanced" button.  Select the "print" action and click on the
"Edit..." button. On the second line, paste:

c:\emacs\bin\runemacs.exe --eval "(defun batch-print () (setq
ps-lpr-command \"c:/progra~1/gsview/gsview/gsprint.exe\") (setq
ps-printer-name t) (find-file (nth 5 command-line-args))
(ps-print-buffer))" --eval "(batch-print)" "%1" --batch

making sure that all of the above is on the one line.  This command
requires ghostscript and ghostview if you don't have a <nowiki>PostScript</nowiki>
printer set up.  If you want the command to prompt you for a printer
prior to printing, you can use:

c:\emacs\bin\runemacs.exe --eval "(defun batch-print () (setq
ps-lpr-command \"c:/progra~1/gsview/gsview/gsprint.exe\") (setq
ps-lpr-switches '(\"-query\")) (setq ps-printer-name t) (find-file
(nth 5 command-line-args)) (ps-print-buffer))" --eval "(batch-print)"
"%1" --batch

If you do have a <nowiki>PostScript</nowiki> printer, you can just use:

c:\emacs\bin\runemacs.exe --eval "(defun batch-print () (find-file (nth 5
command-line-args)) (ps-print-buffer))" --eval "(batch-print)" "%1"
--batch
