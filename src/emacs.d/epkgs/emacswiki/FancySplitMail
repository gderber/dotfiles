When you use the nnml backend, you can split your mail into various
folders.  SplitMail shows you how to set nnmail-split-methods
accordingly.

You can have fancy mail splitting, too, however.  In order to do that,
set nnmail-split-methods to the symbol nnmail-split-fancy (ie. you
need to quote it), and set the variable nnmail-split-fancy (no
quoting) to the rules you want to use.

Here is a small example.  First we disable crossposting, and then we
use the following rules:

* If the Subject matches "color-theme", put the mail into the group mail.emacs.
* If any header matches the regexp gnus-ignored-from-addresses (this variable matches all my email addresses), then put it into the group mail.misc.
* If any header matches an email address from an emacswiki.org account, put it into the mail.emacs.wiki group.
* All remaining mails go into mail.spam.
* The | specifies that the mail shall not be processed further once one of the rules matches.

 (setq nnmail-crosspost nil
       nnmail-split-methods 'nnmail-split-fancy
       nnmail-split-fancy
       `(| ("Subject" "color-theme" "mail.emacs")
	   (any ,gnus-ignored-from-addresses "mail.misc")
	   (any ".*@emacswiki.org" "mail.emacs.wiki")
	   "mail.spam"))

Note that `any' is an abbreviation.  See the variable
nnmail-split-abbrev-alist.

== Dynamic Group Names ==

From the manual node "Fancy Mail Splitting":

If you want to have Gnus create groups dynamically based on some
information in the headers (i.e., do `replace-match'-like substitutions
in the group names), you can say things like:

     (any "debian-\\b\\(\\w+\\)@lists.debian.org" "mail.debian.\\1")

In this example, messages sent to `debian-foo@lists.debian.org' will be
filed in `mail.debian.foo'.

Mailing list on debian.org, sourceforge.net and many-many others, includes notification from SVN and CVS, uses '''List-ID''' header (for ex. List-Id: Boost announce-only mailing list <boost-announce.lists.boost.org> ) so it's easy to sort it just by:

     ;; split by header List-Id
     ("List-Id" ".*<\\(.+\\)>.*" "lists.\\1")


If the string contains the element `\&', then the previously matched
string will be substituted.  Similarly, the elements `\\1' up to `\\9'
will be substituted with the text matched by the groupings 1 through 9.

: A question to this: when this dynamic method creates a new group, will it be subscribed and displayed automatically?  At least on my system (where I create new groups for new colleagues that send an email to me) it doesn't -- StefanKamphausen

== Spam ==

Here's an example that illustrates filtering out spam with nnmail-split-fancy:

 (setq nnmail-split-methods 'nnmail-split-fancy
       nnmail-split-fancy
       '(|
         ;; spam detected by spam-use-regex-headers goes to ‘regex-spam’             
         (: spam-split "regex-spam" 'spam-use-regex-headers)
         ;; all other spam detected by spam-split goes to spam-split-group           
         (: spam-split)
         ;; default mailbox                                                          
         "mail"))

== More ==

For even more advanced setups, see SplitMailUsingBbdb.

If you maintain a blacklist of spammers and want to generate a fancy split rule from it
see BlacklistSpammers.

== Warning ==

Don't split to INBOX (even as your default split). You will get emails being moved around from INBOX to INBOX causing all sorts of confusion.
