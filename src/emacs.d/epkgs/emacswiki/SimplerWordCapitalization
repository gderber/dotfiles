Emacs has separate keybindings for changing the case of a word and the case of a region.  The following makes upcase (M-u), downcase (M-l), and capitalize (M-c) to be "active region aware."  That is, if there is a maked region, they will act on the region, otherwise they will act on the current word.  This eliminates the need to remember the keybingins to upcase and downcase a region (C-x C-u and C-x C-d respectively) and it also creates the new functionality to capitalize regions.

    (defun region-marked? ()
      (and transient-mark-mode mark-active))
     
    (defun my-upcase ()
      (interactive)
      (if (region-marked?) (upcase-region (region-beginning) (region-end)) (upcase-word 1)))
     
    (defun my-downcase ()
      (interactive)
      (if (region-marked?) (downcase-region (region-beginning) (region-end)) (downcase-word 1)))
     
    (defun my-capitalize ()
      (interactive)
      (if (region-marked?)
          (save-excursion
            (let ((beg (region-beginning))
                  (end (region-end)))
              (goto-char beg)
              (while (< (point) end)
                (capitalize-word 1))))
        (capitalize-word 1)))
     
    (global-set-key (kbd "M-u")       'my-upcase)
    (global-set-key (kbd "M-l")       'my-downcase)
    (global-set-key (kbd "M-c")       'my-capitalize)
