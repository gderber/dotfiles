tinymacro.el is part of the TinyTools. It helps assigning macros to keys 
with simple commands. An example:

* To start recording a macro use standard Emacs command: <code>C-x (</code>
* To end recording a macro use standard Emacs command: <code>C-x )</code>. At this stage the package asks
  to which key user wants to assign the macro. Press a key to assign the macro, say F12.

The macro can now be called from the assigned key (e.g. F12). See also section
KeyboardMacros.
