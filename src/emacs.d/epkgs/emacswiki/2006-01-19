We could add a Geocities entry to the InterMap.  Then we could link to __Geocities:gchen275/xemacs/__ or __Geocities:kensanata__ without triggering
the BannedContent check.  I don't think spammers would be able to figure
it out unless they spent some more time on the wiki.

*Update*: As [[alephnull]] asked about it on the EmacsChannel, this is now implemented.
Example: Geocities:gchen275/xemacs/
