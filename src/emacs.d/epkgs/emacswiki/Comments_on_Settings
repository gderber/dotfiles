What is this page supposed to be about? Please change the page title, as "Settings" is far too general. And give the page a category.

I get the impression that this page is meant to describe some library, but which library is unclear.

Please make this page clear, specific, and useful, or it is likely to be deleted. Thx.

There's no `readme' package in el-get, so the install instructions are wrong too. https://github.com/dimitri/el-get/tree/master/recipes/readme.rcp --> 404
