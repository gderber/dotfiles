I use a modified version of html-helper-mode.el (cfml-helper-mode.el) and a
small module to browse
homesite help (help-url.el which is copied/inspired from JDE). You could use
the doc hosted by your dev server.
Those two modules are quick and dirty hacks...I have to say that I often use
homesite too, but taht's bad (tm) !

Hope this helps,

Norbert

in my dot emacs I have :
(setq cfml-helper-verbose '())
(autoload 'cfml-helper-mode "cfml-helper-mode" "Yay Cold Fusion" t)
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.cfm$" . cfml-helper-mode)
auto-mode-alist))
