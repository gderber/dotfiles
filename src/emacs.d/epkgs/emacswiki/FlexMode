flex and bison files are not supported by cc-mode.

There is a flex-mode.el to be found here:

* http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/gnu/emacs-lisp/incoming/flex-mode.el

I have a copy, but I'm not sure about uploading it.  There is no license statement.

That is very unfortunate, because then we cannot distribute it.  Does it have an email address or something?  The upload script will only accept free software, too.

Update: 2018-01-28

Unfortunately, SUNET no longer mirrors GNU software. After some searching I found the Emacs modes here

* ftp://ftp.cse.ohio-state.edu/pub/emacs-lisp/incoming/

Look for flex-mode.el and bison-mode.el there.
