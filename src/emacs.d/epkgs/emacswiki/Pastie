Allows you to paste to http://pastie.caboo.se/ from Emacs.

I added the following to my .emacs. It will ask for a confirmation and put the URL in the clipboard (tested with Aquamacs 1.2a (Emacs 22.1.50.1) on OS X)

    (autoload 'pastie-buffer "pastie" "Paste current buffer to pastie" t)
    (autoload 'pastie-region "pastie" "Paste current region to pastie" t)
    (autoload 'pastie-get "pastie" "Get snippet from pastie" t)
     
    (defadvice pastie-region (around pastie-region-comfort)
      (if (y-or-n-p "Really send to pastie.caboo.se?")
          (progn
            ad-do-it
            (killring-to-clipboard)
            (message "Sent to pastie and stored URL in clipboard and kill-ring"))
        (message "Nothing was sent")
        ))
    (ad-activate 'pastie-region)

    (defun killring-to-clipboard ()
      "Will copy the car of the kill ring into the clipboard"
      (interactive)
      (save-excursion
        (let ((startpos (point)))
          (insert (car kill-ring))
          (clipboard-kill-region startpos (point)))))
