== Check buffers with fragments of html code ==
=== Description ===
The problem is described on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19363837/how-can-i-highlight-unmatched-html-tags-in-emacs/19364696#19364696
Citation:
"How can I highlight unbalanced HTML tags, without writing full HTML documents?"

You can use:

Lisp:html-check-frag.el

For installation and usage see comments therein.

=== Possible improvements ===
# Store parser stack in overlays at tags to speed up jit-font-lock. Currently, an error can cause jit-lock to parse the whole buffer again. With the overlays we only need to parse back to the last overlay.
# The overlays fulfill the following requirements:
## The already parsed region is fully covered by non-overlapping overlays.
## Each of these overlays starts either at the beginning of the buffer or at a html tag. (Where exactly within a tag is yet unspecified.)
## Each of these overlays has the parser stack of its position as its property.
## On re-fontification through jit the driver uses the overlays at the start and the end of the re-fontification region to initialize the parser stack if such overlays exist. Otherwise the currently implemented mechanism is run. After re-fontification the overlays may be extended. At tags new overlays are started.
=== Changes ===
# 2013-10-19: Colorize the error notification in the mode-line. (Implementation already tried but does not work. I assume that is caused by the minor mode highlighters already setting the propertize attribute. Do not mark <!DOCTYPE ...> as error. Regard that html is case-insensitive for detection of void-tags.
