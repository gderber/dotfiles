== sync-window-mode ==
The minor mode [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/sync-window.el|sync-window-mode]] keeps two side-by-side windows synchronized.
You can switch it on by {{{M-x sync-window-mode}}}.

The mode resulted from a discussion on [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20254174/in-split-window-emacs-how-to-search-the-other-buffer-first-line-for-then/20264759#comment33445763_20264759|stackoverflow]].

It is only tested with GnuEmacs 24 and is still experimental.

To use it with mercurial.el put the following lines into your configuration:
{{{
;; mercury related stuff:
(add-hook 'sync-window-master-hook 'mercury-blame-resize)

(add-hook 'sync-window-mode-hook '(lambda ()
                    (set (make-local-variable 'isearch-update-post-hook) #'(lambda () (set-window-hscroll (selected-window) 0)))))
}}}

== Discussion about improvements ==

* TODO: From [[http://stackoverflow.com/users/2639885/ammari|user Ammari at stackoverflow]]: Basically I would like to have both windows synced, so scrolling in one window would scroll the other as well.
* TODO: Make the mode more stable.
* TODO: Maybe, introduce Master-slave principle instead of the requirement that only two side-by-side windows are open?
* TODO: Maybe, allow more windows in frame to be synchronized?
