= XEmacs =

As of version 21.5b24 [[XEmacs]] has support for Xft fonts included (but it must be selected at build time). The release notes at http://xemacs.org/Releases/21.5.24.html have all the details. [http://blog.clemens.endorphin.org/2006/02/beautiful-xemacs.html Additional configuration suggestions] available from CFruhwirth's Weblog.

= GNU Emacs =

Support for this is in GNU Emacs version 23.1. See [[XftGnuEmacs]]. Most X systems will have sub-pixel antialiasing configured by default, but see this [http://jmason.org/howto/subpixel.html HOWTO] if you have trouble.

AquamacsEmacs (on Mac OS X) comes configured to use a range of scalable fonts with antialiasing, which are usable out-of-the box.
