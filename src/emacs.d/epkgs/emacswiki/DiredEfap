From [[dired-efap.el]]:

<pre>
;; dired-efap.el allows the user to edit the filename at point, by
;; hitting a key (like f2) or double-clicking it. The name is edited
;; in the dired buffer, and the renaming takes effect when the user
;; hit the RET key. Only the name of the file at point is tangible and
;; editable, and it uses an special font.
;;
;; This package is an attempt to provide the same user interface to
;; renaming files that some graphical file managers offer.
;;
;; Please, don't confuse dired-efap with wdired package, which I also
;; wrote. Both "packages" provide alternative ways of renaming for
;; dired users, but, while they are both compatible between them, they
;; are oriented to different kind of users. wdired is for users who
;; like the incredible flexibility and power of Emacs editing
;; features. dired-efap is for users that are habituated to use other
;; graphical file managers (or "explorers", however they are called).
