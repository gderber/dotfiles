Categories are a way to organize the navigation and organization of a Web site (see WikiOrganization).

Constructing a taxonomy that is useful and broad enough to encapsulate a diversity of users and authors for written material and even source code and graphics is a difficult job---but somebody's got to do it.  We see enforcement as part of this commitment.

Members of the force:

* AaronHawley, on-duty sergeant.

Job openings:

* Full-time officers
* Part-time police chief
