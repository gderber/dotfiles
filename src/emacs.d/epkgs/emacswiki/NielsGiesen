Been using Emacs since 2005.

Several Emacs Lisp packages carry my signature:

* [[GimpMode]], an interaction/editing mode for GIMP script-fu code.
* [[Mingus]], an mpd-interface for emacs.  
* Both GimpMode and Mingus repositories can be found on [http://github.com/pft/ github], on which I also host some [http://github.com/pft/elisp-assorted smaller libraries].

Also I am -- though not very actively -- making an emacs interface for use of TV-cards:
[http://niels.kicks-ass.org/index.php/emacs/zap zap.el]. Zap.el is what you might call a
settopbox-application. Changing channels, ripping output of tv%%_grab_%%** for a tv-guide in
emacs lisp, scheduling recordings, stuff like that is on my (partially fulfilled)
wish-list.

Note that zap.el is way from being produktionsfaehig, but for the interested, there it is.

I started using emacs beginning 2005 because I got fed up with
word processors dictating what I write while I was writing papers for
my study of Public International Law (in the intermediate phase, I
simply used a typewriter). Using emacs and GNU/Linux (which I began to
use because of my inner tendency to question mainstream thoughts and
practices), and a desire to make things work as I want them drew me
into the world of programming. 

For more info on me you can look on [http://pft.github.com my website].

On IRC and elsewhere on this wiki, I happen to be known as [::pft].
