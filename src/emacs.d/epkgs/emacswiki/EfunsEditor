Efuns is a small text editor, entirely written in ObjectiveCaml.

The following is quoted from the web site.

Compared to Emacs, it offers the following features:

* Unlike Emacs which uses Lisp for dynamic extension, Efuns uses ObjectiveCaml. Advantages of Caml over Lisp are numerous. In particular, static typing gives some security before loading a module inside the editor. Of course, Efuns can compile a module and immediately load it with the "ocaml-eval-buffer" function.
* As Efuns is written in Caml, configuration modules can be integrated directly in the sources when they are mature.
* Efuns is cheaper than Emacs in resources (memory, CPU).
* Efuns integrates lots of Emacs features (undo, minibuffer, accents, compilation with error search, regexps, indentation, completion,...) and some special modes (TeX, Caml, HTML, Makefile, ...). As it was in born in october 1998, it can still evolve a lot ...
* Its interoperability with Caml is really interesting. For example, it can understand Caml binary files to get more informations on compiled modules. Indeed, Efuns already integrates a "ocaml-print-type" function to print the type of values in compiled modules.
* It can use modules generated by Ocamllex and Ocamlyacc, which makes analysing sources files more efficient. Indentations, colorisations and indexing is then easier.
