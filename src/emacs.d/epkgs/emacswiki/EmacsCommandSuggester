Since at least 2002, there's been an item in the EmacsTodo to:

: //Have a command suggestion help system that recognizes patterns
of commands which could be replaced with a simpler common command.
It should not make more than one suggestion per 10 minutes.//

* EmacsCommandSuggestions -- Further discussion of the problem and a list of possible suggestions.

* [[Recs]] or "[R]egular [E]xpression based [C]ommand [S]uggester" is one possible solution based on a simple regexp-based command suggestion minor
mode. It allows you to define patterns of commands as regular
expressions, along with suggestions for more efficient replacements.
