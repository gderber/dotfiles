World Time is great but I wanted a day display. So I made one:

{{{
M-x world-time-list
}}}

Gives you something like:

[[image:WorldTimeScreenshot]]

== Where to get it ==

It's in [[http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/world-time-mode|Marmalade]]

or the GitHub is [[https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-world-time-mode|here]]

== Interesting things ==

This is an example of TabulatedListMode which is a very useful mode for presenting tabular data.
