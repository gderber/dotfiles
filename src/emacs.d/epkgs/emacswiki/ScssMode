== Installation ==

Command line utility sass is required, http://sass-lang.com/. Make
sure sass location is in emacs PATH, example:
   
    (setq exec-path (cons (expand-file-name "~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin") exec-path))

Or customize `scss-sass-command' to point directly to your sass executable.

Add something like this to your emacs load file:

{{{
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/folder-where-you-put-scss-mode-el"))
(autoload 'scss-mode "scss-mode")
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.scss\\'" . scss-mode))
}}}
