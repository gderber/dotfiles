Most applications include primitive editing capabilities.  The use of Emacs as an external editor to provide Emacs editing capabilities to these applications has been discussed previously (see MuttInEmacs, [[Mozilla]]) however these solutions are specific to the application being used and rely on the application's own abilities to launch external editors (typically though plugins such as [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125 It's All Text]).

[http://bur.st/~benc/site/?external-edit external-edit] is a shell script which takes advantage of xautomation and xsel on X11 displays and enables any editor to be launched as an external editor for any application.  Of course, this works really well with EmacsAsDaemon and EmacsClient.
