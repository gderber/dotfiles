Simply typing

    make install

should install pass to the standard locations.

The makefile is aware of the following environment variables:

PREFIX      default: /usr
DESTDIR     default: 
BINDIR      default: $(PREFIX)/bin
LIBDIR      default: $(PREFIX)/lib
MANDIR      default: $(PREFIX)/share/man
SYSCONFDIR  default: /etc

-- Completion Files --

The install target will automatically determine the existance
of bash, zsh, and fish, and install the completion files as
needed. If you'd like to choose manually, you may set WITH_ALLCOMP,
WITH_BASHCOMP, WITH_ZSHCOMP, or WITH_FISHCOMP to "yes" or "no". The
exact paths of the completions can be controlled with BASHCOMPDIR,
ZSHCOMPDIR, and FISHCOMPDIR.

-- Test Suite --

Pass has a test suite which uses Sharness:
<https://github.com/mlafeldt/sharness>

To run all tests, run 'make test'.

To debug an individual test, run it directly with '-v', e.g.:
    $ tests/t0001-sanity-checks.sh -v
