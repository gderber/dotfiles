The equivalent of TransientMarkMode under [[XEmacs]] is known as [[Zmacs]] Regions.  This is enabled by default.
It works just like text selection under all other editors.

If you want the traditional Emacs behavior, use the following init.el code:

  (setq zmacs-regions nil)

This way, the mark (the place you began a selection) is always present once set, and commands that want to
operate on a region will always work, and will operate between the last mark and the current value of point.
No highlighting exists to show you what text will be cut.

With the standard Zmacs Regions behavior, you can get similar behavior by using `M-C-z'; this activates and
displays a highlighted region between wherever you last began a selection and the current value of point.

To get the standard behavior where typing a character deletes the active region, use PendingDeleteMode.
This will probably be the default behavior under XEmacs 22.
