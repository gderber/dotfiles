[http://www.foldr.org/~michaelw/emacs/mwe-screen-server.tar.gz mwe-screen-server] provides a mechanism by which you can run emacs in server mode
in a screen session.  When emacs is run, it will automatically
switch to the screen window with emacs server running.  When
finished in the buffer (C-x #), this will automatically switch the
user back to the screen window they originated from.

This code provides roughly the same functionality as screenserver.el, 
but does not rely on temporary files for Emacs<->screen communication.  On the
downside, it therefore only works with GnuClient.

Additional features compared to screenserver.el:
* handles multiple (client) editing session correctly (it
  switches each back to the screen where it was started from)
     
* attaches to a running screen if not currently running inside
  one (also detaches if editing is finished)

* gracefully handles X vs. TTY Emacs servers

Requirements:

* GnuClient (mw-screen-server does NOT work with EmacsClient since
    it lacks the "-eval" feature)
: Note: emacsclient from emacs cvs now has -eval capabilities, just like XEmacs -- BasKok
* [http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/ GNU screen]

Tested with:
* GNU Emacs 21.3.50.1
* gnuserv 3.12.4
* screen 3.9.12
