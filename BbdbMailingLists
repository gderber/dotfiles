There are two different things you must consider when talking about
mailing-lists.

(These instructions are correct for BBDBv3 as of 2015-04-28).

== One mail alias for several people ==

If you have a group of people that you often send mail to, eg. your
family, you can define a _mail-alias_ for every group-member in your
database.  Here is an example for how I do it:

* Search for all family members.  Use `M-x bbdb' and search for "schroeder".
* Elide (suppress display) any non-family records using `o'.
* Add a mail-alias for all remaining records.  Use `*a' and type the mail-alias "schroeder".

You also need to tell the BBDB to define the mail abbreviations for
you.  This depends on the mail package you use -- here is the code for
your ##~/.emacs## for both plain mail-mode, or the message-mode that comes
with Gnus.

In BBDBv2:

    (add-hook 'mail-setup-hook 'bbdb-define-all-aliases)
    (add-hook 'message-setup-hook 'bbdb-define-all-aliases)

In BBDBv3:

    (add-hook 'mail-setup-hook 'bbdb-mail-aliases)
    (add-hook 'message-setup-hook 'bbdb-mail-aliases)

Now you can create a new mail and type `schroeder SPC' at the To:
header.  Since "schroeder" is a mail-abbrev, this will get expanded to
all the recipients with the schroeder mail-alias in the BBDB.

== A record for a real mailing-list ==

You can treat a mailing list just like an ordinary person.  The only
thing you might want to consider are the gnus-public and gnus-private
fields, if you want to SplitMailUsingBbdb.
