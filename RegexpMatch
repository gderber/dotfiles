The following code will search a list for a string matching a regular expression and return it.

    (catch 'match
      (dolist (str '("foo" "bla.gz"))
         (when (string-match ".*gz" str)
           (throw 'match str))))

Here is something similar using CL, and as a defun:

  (defun member-re (re lis)
    (member-if (lambda (item)
                 (string-match re item))
               lis))
