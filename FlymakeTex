The following are hints for using FlyMake with TeX and LaTeX.

Note: If your latex file has digits immediately before the dot (e.g. <code>design2.tex</code>), flymake will assume it is a portion of a larger work and try to find another file that <code>\include</code>s it!

Is it possible to use latex with flymake on linux machines? I try it today and it seems that the mode works only under miktex.

This mode works on linux machines with customization. The default program (texify) is incorrect, so I used [http://baruch.ev-en.org/proj/chktex/ chktex]:

  (defun flymake-get-tex-args (file-name)
    (list "chktex" (list "-q" "-v0" file-name)))

If you use a recent version of LaTeX having the option "-file-line-error-style",
you can use:

  (defun flymake-get-tex-args (file-name)
    (list "latex" (list "-file-line-error-style" file-name)))

== ChkTeX ==

Another setting to use [http://baruch.ev-en.org/proj/chktex/ ChkTeX]:
After installing the checking tool, you can put the following .chktexrc on your home direcotry:

  # ~/.chktexrc
  OutFormat
  {
  
  # -v0; silent mode : change the default setting of -v0 as follows:
  "%f%b%l%b%c%b%k: %m!n"
  
  }

Then, write .emacs for flymake as follows:

  ;; Flymake for LaTeX
  (defun flymake-get-tex-args (file-name)
    (list "chktex" (list "-g0" "-r" "-l" (expand-file-name "~/.chktexrc") "-I" "-q" "-v0" file-name)))
  (push
    '("^\\(\.+\.tex\\):\\([0-9]+\\):\\([0-9]+\\):\\(.+\\)"
     1 2 3 4) flymake-err-line-patterns)

For Japanese, unfortunately, chktex doesn't understand 2byte code e.g. Japanese character.
Trick: we can pass the tex file to the kakasi filter, then check it.

Here is another solution for Japanese TeX users:

  ;; Flymake for LaTeX
  (defun flymake-get-tex-args (file-name)
    (list (expand-file-name "~/bin/flycheck_latex.sh") (list file-name)))
  (push
    '("^\\(\.+\.tex\\):\\([0-9]+\\):\\([0-9]+\\):\\(.+\\)"
     nil 2 3 4) flymake-err-line-patterns)

  #!/bin/sh
  
  real_file_name=$@
  file_name=`basename "$real_file_name"`
  tmp_file=`mktemp`
  tmp_dir=`mktemp -d`
  fake_name="$tmp_dir/$file_name"
  
  # assumed that the source code has EUC-JP encoding                                                                                             
  cat "$real_file_name" | kakasi -ieuc -Ha -Ka -Ja -Ea -ka -s > "$tmp_file"
  
  mkdir -p $tmp_dir
  cp $tmp_file $fake_name
  chktex -g0 -r -l ~/.chktexrc -I -q -v0 $fake_name
  
  # clean up                                                                                                                                     
  rm -fr "$tmp_file"
  rm -fr "$tmp_dir"

== Tex Live! ==

To use flymake with latex or pdflatex from the texlive distribution 
on linux (as e.g., included in OpenSuse):

  (defun flymake-get-tex-args (file-name)
    (list "pdflatex" (list "-file-line-error" "-draftmode" "-interaction=nonstopmode" file-name)))
