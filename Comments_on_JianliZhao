I tried to update my page ExtendSMIME. However, previews of the current as well as the new version fail, as my page includes URIs that match one of your Ban rule. I'm not even allowed to mention that word here. Is is o n l i n e. Why do you think that this rule is necessary?

This is the error message:

hi jianli,

Thanks for this nice package. There's a problem with the faces: it is compatible with light themes, but not dark themes. Is it ok to inherit instead of hard coding faces?

Sorry I just found this "comments" zone and today is 2016.4.12... However I am glad to see there is users. And for further suggestion please send to my email jianlizhao1@gmail.com which I will check regularly.
