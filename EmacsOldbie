: ''One problem is that both Emacs and I are growing old.'' -- Fran√ßoisPinard, Thoughts on editors (Emacs in particular) [http://pinard.progiciels-bpi.ca/notes/Thoughts_on_editors.html]

This is the page for people who have used Emacs for a loooong time.  For those people, in fact, that have considered ''quitting'' using Emacs.

* Moving from Emacs to Vim because Emacs is like a non-sinking ship going in the wrong direction: "Emacs is a heavy cargo that, even if it used to establish a direction for everybody, might now have trouble manoeuvring along directions established elsewhere, because of its terrible inertia, both political and technical. Not that it doesn't move, but a great deal of energy is required every time." [http://pinard.progiciels-bpi.ca/notes/Thoughts_on_editors.html]
* Sticking to Emacs until it doesn't get ported to some fancy new architecture: "What Emacs doesn't do is to give up that foundation in order to follow the latest trend. Instead, it incorporates what is good and compensates for the rest. This, of course, will make Emacs feel "old" for the followers of hype, but the wise will see its intrinsic power and lasting value." -- EmacsDefense
* I'm kinda moving away from Emacs to !TextMate after about 12 years of continuous Emacs usage.  It seems to me that the smartest people in my current field are all using !TextMate and developing bundles for !TextMate.  It's a momentum thing.  The circles of people who happen to work with some new fangled technology doesn't always overlap with the Emacs community.  In that situation, the new fangled technology's community is likely to grow around a different editor. -- DougAlcorn
** It seems [[Lathi]] my have lost his religion, but isn't entirely willing to give up on his favorite free software, especially Emacs, "As a long time Emacs user, I'm confident Emacs can do whatever !TextMate can."[http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/EmacsAndRuby]
* I've been using Emacs for nearly my entire programming career, which spans over 25 years now, and can't imagine moving to another "hot new editor".  The path since the beginning is littered with the carcasses of "new fangled technology", yet I feel I will always be able to use Emacs on any platform I work on (which currently includes Linux, *BSD, Windows and !MacOSX). And that counts for a lot in this profession. I don't have time  to waste learning a new editor because I have to work on a new platform. -- JonathanArnold
** In this case I think you've posted on the wrong page! You don't seem to be considering quitting... In fact, your argument sounds a lot like EmacsDefense (also in CategoryHumor). Maybe you should write something on EmacsAndXEmacs... -- AlexSchroeder
