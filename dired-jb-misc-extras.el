;;
;; This library provides various miscellaneous `dired' related commands & functions
;; that I use occasionally. 
;;

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below is a complete command list:
;;
;;  `dired-get-size'
;;    Get total size of marked files using linux du command. This only works on local directories.
;;  `dired-up-dir'
;;    In dired go up a directory and replace current buffer, instead of creating a new one.
;;  `dired-do-shell-command-regexp'
;;    Create and run shell commands from selected filenames which match REGEXP.
;;  `dired-find-file-other-window'
;;    Wrapper around dired-find-file-other-window.
;;  `image-dired-show-all-tags'
;;    Show all tags that have been used to tag files.
;;  `image-dired-display-thumbnail-original-image-fullsize'
;;    Display current thumbnail's original fullsize image in display buffer.
;;  `image-dired-rename-original'
;;    Rename original file corresponding to current thumbnail.
;;  `image-dired-copy-original'
;;    Copy original file corresponding to current thumbnail.
;;
;; The following existing commands are advised:
;;
;;  `image-dired-display-thumbnail-original-image'
;;    Display current thumbnail's original image in display buffer.
;;  `image-dired-thumbnail-display-external'
;;    Display current thumbnail externally using `run-associated-program' (if installed).

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put dired-jb-misc-extras.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'dired-jb-misc-extras)

  REGEXP defaults to the last regexp used.
  Output of shell commands (along with commands executed) will be displayed in `Dired regexp shell commands output*'
  which will pop-up underneath the dired buffer.

  With non-zero prefix argument ARG, the command operates on the next ARG
  files.  Otherwise, it operates on all the marked files, or the current
  file if none are marked.

  As each match is found, the user must type a character saying
    what to do with it.  For directions, type \\[help-command] at that time.

  With a zero prefix arg, the regexp matches the absolute file name.
  Normally, only the non-directory part of the file name is used.

  Note: before running the shell command, it will cd into the directory containing the file,
        and this cd command will be displayed in the confirmation prompt."
