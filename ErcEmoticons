==Tips==
* If you think the text is replace incorrectly, you can use M-x emoticons-erase-region to remove the icons.
* If you want look the text of the icon , put mouse on the icon. It will show by tooltip if you turn on tooltip-mode. Or you can use C-u C-x = to see the text properties you self. Or you just turn on eldoc-mode like:
<pre>
   (add-hook 'erc-mode-hook
             (lambda ()
                (eldoc-mode t)
                (setq eldoc-documentation-function
                  'emoticons-help-echo)))
</pre>
the help-echo will show in minibuffer when cursor is on the icon.
