The function defined below, `dired-of-file', will open DiredMode for the currently visited file only.  It is similar to `M-x dired-jump RET', except the listing in Dired is only for the current file, and nothing else.  Included here is a `dired-of-file-other-window'.

{{{
(defun dired-of-file (&optional file other-window)
  "Open Dired of FILE for current buffer in OTHER-WINDOW if nil.
If FILE is non-nil, then open Dired with only the file.
If FILE is nil and the current buffer has an associated file,
  then open Dired with only the current file.

See `dired'.  See also `dired-jump'."
  ;; Based on `browse-url-of-file' that comes with Emacs.
  (interactive)
  (if (not (or file
	       (setq file (buffer-file-name))))
      (error "Current buffer has no file")
    (if other-window
	(dired-other-window file)
      (dired file))
    (dired-goto-file file)))

(defun dired-of-file-other-window (&optional file)
  "Open Dired in other window for FILE or current buffer if nil.
See `dired-of-file'."
  (interactive)
  (dired-of-file file t))
}}}

Really, you should just use `M-x dired-jump'.
