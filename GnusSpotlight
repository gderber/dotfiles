Search mail with Gnus and Spotlight (Mac OS).

You may need to install "MailSpool.mdimporter" (http://www.yoshidam.net/diary/Spotlight/)
to index your mail spool files of to spotlight.  That importer decodes non-UTF mails, attaching
sender, receiver attributes to spotlight index.

Note: This tool no longer works on MacOS X 10.9.  Its source codes are put on github
(https://github.com/kawabata/MailSpool.mdimporter).  Someone needs to re-write it to work with
newest MacOS X.

Download the code from Lisp:gnus-spotlight.el.

Installation:
{{{
(require 'gnus-spotlight)
(gnus-spotlight-insinuate)
}}}

This makes `C-c C-n' in the Summary buffer search your mail using Spotlight and lets you browse the result in Gnus.

Note:  nnir-spotlight.el (http://github.com/kawabata/nnir-spotlight) uses Gnus nnir interface for searching mails.
