* I already had CygWin installed.
* Grabbed these Cygwin ispell binaries: ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/win32/develop/gnuwin32/cygwin/porters/Humblet_Pierre_A/V1.1/ispell-3.2.06-cygwin-1.3-bin.tar.gz (Here's the <a href="ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/win32/develop/gnuwin32/cygwin/porters/Humblet_Pierre_A/V1.1/ispell-3.2.06-cygwin-1.3-bin.README">README</a>.)
* From the Cygwin shell:
 
    cd / #change to cygwin root dir impt!
    tar zxvf [path/to/tarball/]cygwin-1.3-bin.tar.gz

* At the Windows desktop right-click My Computer and choose Properties, click the Advanced tab and then the Environment Variables button.
* Highlight <b>Path</b> in the bottom pane and click Edit. Add the following directories to the end of your path: 

    C:\cygwin\usr\local\bin;C:\cygwin\bin

Now Windows can find both <b>ispell.exe</b> and <b>cygwin1.dll</b>.
* Launch a new DOS shell (Start Menu -> Run -> cmd) and type: 

    C:\Documents and Settings\luser>ispell -v
    @(#) International Ispell Version 3.2.06 08/01/01
    @(#) Copyright (c), 1983, by Pace Willisson

    @(#) 2001, by Geoff Kuenning, Claremont, CA.  All rights reserved.
    ...

If you don't see that ispell output, there's probably something wrong with your PATH variable. 
* Launch a new Emacs.  M-x ispell-buffer should start ispell. 


Another option might be to compile the source here http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/tars/ispell-3.3.02.tar.gz under Cygwin.  I ran into missing programs and was too impatient to go through that.

This inspired me to test with CVS Emacs. 
To use ispell just install aspell from Cygwin.

== Configuring Ispell with Russian Dictionary ==

(This is a repost from my blog entry, hopefully someone will find it useful)

Emacs <code>ispell</code> package is capable of running both Ispell and Aspell, but
as far as I've tried Aspell, it gives some nonsensical results. Maybe this 
was due to some misconfiguration, but I wasn't eager to sort it out.

So I went with Ispell. Configuring it is also a bit of obscure process, so 
I thought it would be good to have an installation guide step by step:

Download Ispell from [ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/win32/develop/gnuwin32/cygwin/porters/Humblet_Pierre_A/V1.1/ispell-3.2.06-cygwin-1.3-bin.tar.gz here].

You should have Cygwin installed on your machine. Let's say, it is in folder <code>c:\Programs\Cygwin</code>.

Unpack aforementioned Ispell to your Cygwin directory.

Go to <code>c:\Programs\Cygwin\usr\local\bin</code> and copy <code>ispell.exe</code> to <code>c:\Programs\Cygwin\bin</code>. This is needed to run ispell directly from Windows, bypassing Cygwin shells.

Download russian dictionaries from [ftp://scon155.phys.msu.su/pub/russian/ispell/rus-ispell.tar.gz here] and unpack them to some temporary folder. Let's say it would be <code>d:\temp</code>.

Run Cygwin shell and perform the following commands (modify them appropriately):

<pre>
    cd /cygdrive/d/temp
    make win
    mv russian.hash russianw.hash
    mv russian.aff russianw.aff
    mv russianw.* /usr/local/lib
</pre>

From now on, you sould be able to check files encoded in windows-1251 charset directly under Cygwin, like that:

<pre>
    LANG=ru_RU ispell -drussianw file.txt
</pre>

Or, under <code>cmd.exe</code>:

<pre>
    set LANG=ru_RU.CP1251
    c:\Programs\Cygwin\bin\ispell.exe -drussianw file.txt
</pre>

Now all we need to do is to configure Emacs correctly. Add the following lines to your dotemacs:


    (setq ispell-program-name "c:\\Programs\\cygwin\\bin\\ispell.exe")
    (setq ispell-dictionary "russianw")


This should do the task. Now restart emacs and try running ispell on some file.
