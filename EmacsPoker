EmacsPoker is a very simple video poker game that runs inside of Emacs.

It's available from my web page: http://marc.abramowitz.info/archives/2006/04/17/emacs-poker/

or Lisp:poker.el

If you have ideas or code that you want to contribute, e-mail me at msabramo at yahoo dot com.


Replace line 30 with :

    (defconst poker-suits '(♥ ♦ ♠ ♣))

and it look a litle bit nicer :-)
