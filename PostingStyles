Posting styles are using in Gnus to set various headers of outgoing messages (mail and news) depending on which group you are in.  Read the Gnus manual for more.

Here is an example.

* The ".*" entry holds my default signature.
* The ""de.rec.spiele.rpg.misc" entry holds an alternate signature.
* The "emacs" entry has an alternate signature and calls a function for more.  The function `vfaq-entry' returns a string.  [http://www.messengers-of-messiah.org/~csebold/emacs/emacsvfaq.el]
* The "emacs.sources" entry changes the Followup-To header.
* The "atlantis" header changes name and email address.
* The "mail.foo" entry has a very long signature.
* The "mail.foo.bar" entry adds a Reply-To header for the mailing list, and it adds a Cc header unless there already is one.  This is a hack.  It assumes that the variable `header' will have a value when replying (therefore a new Cc header is not needed).  When sending a new message, the variable `header' is undefined and therefore the custom header is added.

Here's something I just did with posting-styles.  Here at work we use the MDaemon mail server.  It is configured to allow relaying iff you use a valid "From:" address (note that IP address is not taken into account at all).  So, I have to set my "From:" address to be my work address.  However, I don't always want to use my work address.  So, I'm able to use posting-styles to handle conditional setting of "Reply-To:".  This basically says to default to using my own mail address if the 'm' key is hit from the *Group* buffer.  If I'm replying to an article, then use whatever was in the "To:" field of the article.  Also, if I'm sending a message from within my work account (always nnml backend), use my work address.  It's much simpler in elisp than english. --LathI


 (setq gnus-posting-styles
      '((""
         ("Reply-To" (save-excursion
                       (or (and (get-buffer gnus-article-buffer)
		                (set-buffer gnus-article-buffer)
		                (message-fetch-field "To"))
		            "mailbox@home"))))
        ("nnml.*"
          ("Reply-To" "mailbox@work"))))
