[http://www.mulgasoft.com/emacsplus Emacs+] is an Eclipse plug in by MarkFeber designed to provide a more Emacs like experience in the Eclipse text editors.  Some of the major features are listed below.  In cases where the normal Emacs binding interferes with the default eclipse binding, the Emacs binding is preferred.

* Keyboard macros 
* M-x command execution
* C-u universal-argument
* C-x b (switch to buffer) with search
* Emacs style point/mark selection with both global and buffer-local mark rings
* Emacs style search and query/replace with regular expressions and subcommands
* A kill ring for deleted text
* Balanced expression (s-expression) commands
* Split editor windows (C-x 2, C-x 3)
* Rectangle Commands
* Named registers
* Tags search (without tags)
* Transposition of characters, words, lines and s-expressions
* Line and character commands
* Space and blank line handling
* Simple text manipulation commands
* End-of-line comment operations

It is available at no cost

Calling Emacs+ free software is a terrible lie! - There is no source code available.

According to the author whom I contacted about this issue this is not by accident, but by design.

The plugin uses the Eclipse Public License (EPL). According to the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html GNU license list], it "is similar to the Common Public License, and our comments on the CPL apply equally to the EPL. The only change is that the EPL removes the broader patent retaliation language regarding patent infringement suits specifically against Contributors to the EPL'd program." The Common Public License "is a free software license. Unfortunately, its weak copyleft and choice of law clause make it incompatible with the GNU GPL."

Thus, no matter what the author says, the license says that it is free software and not "a terrible lie".

Furthermore, if the plugin is distributed without source code, then it must inform "licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange" according to section 3 a iv. If you really want to force the issue, you could contact the Eclipse Foundation or post on the community forum.

This interpretation was exactly the way I read it, as I am no lawyer, I was not quite sure, if I missinterpreted it.

If this is the right interpretation of the EPL let me restate my proposition:

Emacsplus is EPL is a terrible lie!
