[[de:Pastebin]]
[[de:pastebin]]
pastebin is an Emacs interface to [http://pastebin.com pastebin.com].

You can use it to send little snippets of code (or whole buffers) to the web for sharing with others.

pastebin allows sending of regions or whole buffers and let's you specify the virtual host for pastebin. So you can send code to emacs.pastebin.com or myproject.pastebin.com.

The code is downloadable from the wiki here: [[pastebin.el]] 

[new:IvanKorotkov:2010-11-25 19:04 UTC] Apparently this version is broken as reported by RyanDavis: <code>pastebin-version-path</code> is undefined. - IvanKorotkov
[new:NicFerrier:2010-11-25 19:56 UTC] Fixed now. Thanks. - NicFerrier

----

The code is also on a [https://github.com/nicferrier/elpastebin github repo here.]
----

There are two versions of pastebin's code. One is the main site available on the Internet, the other is an earlier downloadable version. The pastebin elisp library supports both of these via configuration which allows the version supported by a particular domain to be specified.

----

IvanKorotkov kindly updated this code to match the new [http://pastebin.com/api.php pastebin.com API] and also added customization group added allowing to set default prefix (subdomain) and modes-alist. 

He keeps his version here: [http://tweedle-dee.org/svn/emacs.d/site-lisp/pastebin.el pastebin.el]

---

That version varies widely from the one on here and it looks like the
one on here is newer. Unfortunately, the one on here seems more than a
little shortsighted. To use subdomains you used to be able to
customize the following:

    '(pastebin-default-subdomain "zenspider")

Now, you must do all of:

    '(pastebin-default-domain "zenspider.pastebin.com")
    '(pastebin-domain-versions (quote (("pastebin.com" "/api_public.php")
                                       ("zenspider.pastebin.com" "/api_public.php")
                                       ("pastebin.example.com" "/pastebin.php"))))

The subdomain code was much more straightforward.

---

I just found another bug. Using it with subdomains now returns urls
like:

    http://zenspider.pastebin.com.pastebin.com/BAPMb2A3

asvil updated IvanKorotkov's code to match the new [http://pastebin.com/api pastebin.com API].

New pastebin.el version here: [[newpastebin.el]]

----

I've change newpastebin.el, if no name is provided to pastebin function, buffer-name is used. Also
fix the check for region. 
Here is [[buffer-name-pastebin.el]]

Editing: I create a new version of pastebin.el, supporting fetch and deletion, here is:
[https://github.com/gkos/emacs-pastebin gkos/emacs-pastebin]

[new:NicFerrier:2013-01-21 17:47 UTC] Get in touch with me via github? I'd be quite happy to assign you the repo for pastebin.el

You access your API-key from a text file rather than inserting it directly in your emacs init-file. See the [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Comments_on_pastebin|Comments] page.
