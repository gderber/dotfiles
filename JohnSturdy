I use emacs for just about everything.

You can see most of my elisp at http://www.cb1.com/~john/computing/emacs/lisp/index.html, and I have also started some sourceforge projects in elisp:

* EmacsVersor (http://emacs-versor.sourceforge.net/)
Versatile cursors -- lets you switch the arrow keys etc easily between different dimensions, and also provides high-level editing like converting inline code blocks to out-of-line functions

* SideBrain (http://sidebrain.sourceforge.net/)
A sidekick for your forebrain -- keeps track of stacks of open tasks, and of observations (I've now stopped using this myself, and recommend PlannerMode instead)

* MuLVoc (http://mulvoc.sourceforge.net/)
MUlti-Lingual Vocabulary -- pops up translations of words as you type

* Emacs-Ringing (http://emacs-ringing.sourceforge.net/)
Learning aid for change-ringing methods (the "tunes" for the bell-ringing style used largely in the UK)

An unusual thing about my emacs is that it can be used largely handsfree, with pedals driving a navigation system I have invented (emacs-versor), and with extensions to voice input, too.  And I also wrote the JoyStick / GamePad interface, all of these to make editing quicker and more efficient and more elegant... and less painful.  I'm aiming towards having a ConversationalEmacs.

Wow, hands free!! That must be quite amazing.  Why did you do it? [[RSI]]? Welcome to the wiki! -- AlexSchroeder

Indeed, the fancy input stuff is largely because of [[RSI]].
