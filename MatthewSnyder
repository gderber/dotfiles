My name is Matthew Snyder. I write about Lisp and Emacs at http://msnyder.info.

Some notable entries include:

* [http://msnyder.info/posts/2012/05/icloud-reminders-orgmode/ Syncing
  iCloud Reminders and Org-mode]. This essay introduces the ElStar
  project, whose goal is to provide synchronization support between
  Emacs and various OS X data stores: Contacts, Calendars, Reminders,
  iTunes, and the like.

* [http://msnyder.info/posts/2011/11/introducing-gopher.el/
  Introducing gopher.el]. This essay introduces GopherEl, whose goal
  is to provide a typographically pleasing Gopher extension to Emacs.

* [http://msnyder.info/posts/2011/07/introducing-narcissus/ Narcissus,
  a blogging platform built on Org-mode]. This essay describes a goal
  to use OrgMode for static blog generation in an intelligent manner.

== Current Inbox ==

* Yaoddmuse doesn't allow creating pages.

* Starting a comment with [<nowiki>new::</nowiki>] doesn't add the
  user's name and the timestamp to the visible HTML output.

* Something about being able to actually track bugs with ElispArea
  code.

* Should discussions on pages be moved to their respective
  <nowiki>Comments_on_ pages</nowiki>? I really wish that prefix was
  `Talk:` or something. It'd be so much cleaner.

* Yaoddmuse font-faces do not respect color theme.
