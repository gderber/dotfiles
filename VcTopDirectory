One particulary nasty thing with VersionControl and such version control systems as git or Bazaar, is that <code>vc-dir</code> invoked on a sub-directory shows status for whole repository. 

Not only does it list files you probably don't want to see, it makes all paths in <code>vc-dir</code> buffer invalid: suppose you have directory A with directory B. <code>vc-dir</code> buffer on A will have A/B entry but if you click on it, it will try to open A/A/B and complain about no such file existing.

There are some workarounds for particular control systems, like [http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=1589#15 this one].

The following code can be used as general workaround. It makes <code>vc-dir</code> buffer always open top-level directory of the repository, thus at least making all entries have correct path. Tested with (please add other VCS if it works):
* Git
* Bazaar

  (defadvice vc-dir-prepare-status-buffer (before my-vcs-goto-top-directory activate compile)
    (let* ((backend (ad-get-arg 2))
           (vcs-dir (ad-get-arg 1))
           (vcs-top-dir (vc-call-backend backend 'responsible-p vcs-dir)))
      (when (stringp vcs-top-dir)
        (ad-set-arg 1 vcs-top-dir))))
