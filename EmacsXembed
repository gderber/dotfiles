= Emacs and Xembed =

GNU Emacs 23.1 supports the XEmbed specification. You can embed Emacs in another application on X11.  The command line option --parent-id is used to pass the parent window id to Emacs.  See http://standards.freedesktop.org/xembed-spec/xembed-spec-latest.html for details about XEmbed.

== embedding emacs in other apps ==

currently I have no good example of how this works with existing apps, but I made a small
gtk app that creates a gtk_socket, and prints the window id of that socket.
When the program runs, emacs can be started with the --parent-id flag with the socket id, and 
emacs shows up in the demo app. Cool!

It would be very cool to embed Emacs into [[http://www.srware.net/en/software_srware_iron.php Iron]] or Firefox so every TEXTAREA would be governed by Emacs. Maybe [[http://people.ksp.sk/~martin/firefox/extensions/EmbeddedEditor/ EmbeddedEditor]] can be updated to do this. I tried it at some point but I could not get it to work properly.

I created a small [[http://bitbucket.org/ArneBab/kembed-emacs/src/tip/qxembed-emacs.py proof-of-concept PyQt4]] program which just opens a window and embeds emacs in it.

You can now embed emacs in KMail: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=255008
emacs --parent-id %w %f 
I still have some issues with it, though: the emacs frame starts tiny instead of filling the textarea (I filed an emacs bug for that: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2013-01/msg00623.html ).

I've created an extensions that use XEMBED to embed emacs (and other editors) into firefox or chromium which you can find here: https://github.com/larsjsol/edembed
 . I hope it will be useful for some of you.
