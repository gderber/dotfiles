== Investigate the font-lock face ==

One approach is to check the ##face## property at point. For instance, comments can commonly be identified as having the ##font-lock-comment-face## (press '##C-u C-x =##'):

    (eq (get-text-property (point) 'face)
        'font-lock-comment-face)

Similarly, strings have the ##font-lock-string-face##:

    (eq (get-text-property (point) 'face)
        'font-lock-string-face)

This will of course only work if using [EnablingFontLock Font Lock Mode].
