TamakoshiHiroki wrote tategaki.el which can do simple Japanese typesetting.

Here is a simple example:

 A B C D                     F A
 E F G ?   turns into        G B
 H I                         ? C
                             H D
                             I E

You can get it from here:

* [[Lisp:tategaki.el]]

Note: The page is in japanese, but by examining all the links on the page, you will find the one linking to the lisp file.

The elisp source file is encoded using the euc-jp encoding.  This is not automatically detected in Emacs 20.7.  Use the following sequence to save the file in a different encoding.  The new encoding is automatically detected by Emacs 20.7 and will enable you to read the comments without fancy finger acrobatics.

# Open using euc-jp: `C-x RET c euc-jp RET C-x C-f tategaki.el RET'
# Save using iso-2022-jp: `C-x RET c iso-2022-jp RET C-x C-w RET'
