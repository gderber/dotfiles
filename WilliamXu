Hi, I'm William Xu (AKA [::xwl] on EmacsChannel), from Beijing, China. I
began to use Emacs since 2003, and can not live without it ever
since. I love it!

I have a homepage -
http://xwl.appspot.com.  You can contact me via
william.xwl@gmail.com.



== Some Extensions ==

[Note: latest version for the following extensions could be found at my homepage and hopefully, also at gnu.emacs.sources.]

* [http://xwl.appspot.com/ref/ga.tar.gz ga.tar.gz] - Generic apt alike interfaces for various package management tools, such as apt-get, pkgsrc, fink, etc. 
* [http://xwl.appspot.com/ref/finkinfo-mode.el finkinfo-mode.el] - Major mode for editing fink info files.
* [http://xwl.appspot.com/ref/buffer-action.el buffer-action.el] - Based on ideas from SmartCompile, but is a rewritten & extended version.
* [http://xwl.appspot.com/ref/smart-operator.el smart-operator.el] - Automatically insert whitespaces before and after
operators. e.g., type "=", get " = "; type "+=", get " += ". Handy for writing C-style sources.
* [http://xwl.appspot.com/ref/wordnet.el wordnet.el] - A simple interface to wordnet dictionary.
* [http://xwl.appspot.com/ref/less.el less.el] - View files using less keys, like j, k, f, b, g, G, etc.
* WajigMode - a wrapper around ‘wajig’, deb package manager for Emacsers.
* [http://xwl.appspot.com/ref/cal-china-x.el cal-china-x.el] - Localizes calendar display for chinese users.
* DiredIsearch - Do isearch in Dired but match only at file names
* [http://xwl.appspot.com/ref/easy-todo.el easy-todo.el]  - Manage your todos in an extremely easy way.

== Emacs Tips ==

=== Revert buffer with tramp sudo without losing already made changes ===

I often find myself editing some system config files owned by
root, and then desperately realize that I have no permission to
write.  With this function, now I can revert current buffer as
root(with sudo) without losing my early modifications!

Note: for this function to work on a remote machine as well, i.e., login as root@remote_host, you need to config tramp-default-proxies-alist properly, for example:

    (add-to-list 'tramp-default-proxies-alist
                 '("remote_hostname" "\\`root\\'" "/ssh:%h:"))


    (defun xwl-revert-buffer-with-sudo ()
      "Revert buffer using tramp sudo.
    This will also reserve changes already made by a non-root user."
      (interactive)
      (let ((f (buffer-file-name)))
        (when f
          (let ((content (when (buffer-modified-p)
                           (widen)
                           (buffer-string))))
            (if (file-writable-p f)
                (revert-buffer)
              (kill-buffer (current-buffer))
              (if (file-remote-p f)
                  (find-file
                   (replace-regexp-in-string "^\\/[^:]+:" "/sudo:" f))
                (find-file (concat "/sudo::" f)))
              (when content
                (let ((buffer-read-only nil))
                  (erase-buffer)
                  (insert content))))))))

=== Use "symbol link file" for attached files in Gnus mail ===

Instead of making copies.  This could save you some space.

    (setq gnus-gcc-externalize-attachments 'all)

=== Apply xterm color scheme to dired ===

So different types of file will be colored like in xterm.  See Lisp:XwlXtermDired.

=== Config file drag-n-drop behaviour ===

As an example:

    (defadvice find-file-noselect (around config-drag-n-drop activate)
      "配置文件 drag-n-drop 行为。"
      (let ((file (ad-get-arg 0)))

        ;; 添加音乐、视频文件至 EMMS
        (when (string-match (emms-player-get emms-player-mplayer 'regex) file)
          (emms-add-file file)
          (unless emms-player-playing-p
            (with-current-emms-playlist
              (goto-char (point-max))
              (forward-line -1)
              (emms-playlist-mode-play-smart)))
          (error (format "File `%s' opened in EMMS" file)))

        ;; 粘贴邮件附件
        (save-excursion
          (goto-char (point-max))           ; for handling mmm-mode
          (when (eq major-mode 'message-mode)
            (insert
             (format
              "<#part type=\"%s\" filename=\"%s\" disposition=attachment>
    <#/part>"
              (mm-default-file-encoding file)
              file))
            (error (format "File `%s' attached" file))))

        ad-do-it))

== Wish Lists ==

* Scheme Emacs - Scheme is so elegant!

Will here be my little web home for Emacs ? :-)
