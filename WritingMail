WritingMail in GNU Emacs is as simple as typing `C-x m'.

Action behind this key binding depends on `mail-user-agent' variable.
It is set to `sendmail-user-agent' by default which means you will be
using MailMode to composer your mail.

Other candidates are:

# `mh-e-user-agent' mostly used with [[MH-E]] client.
# `message-user-agent' for [[Gnus]]. It uses MessageMode.
# `gnus-user-agent' also for [[Gnus]]

[[Rmail]] and [[VM]] users are likely to use the default value and
thus they use MailMode.

These are the default clients shipped in the GNU Emacs distribution.
There are many other [[MUA]] not part of GNU Emacs
(WanderLust,[[Mew]], etc.).

Here is a short list of how you would configure GNU Emacs

* [[Rmail]]:

 (setq mail-user-agent 'sendmail-user-agent)

* [[Gnus]]:

 (setq mail-user-agent 'gnus-user-agent)

* [[MH-E]]:

 (setq mail-user-agent 'mh-e-user-agent)

* WanderLust:

 (setq mail-user-agent 'wl-user-agent)

To change the package used for composition, just add one of the above
line to you InitFile.
