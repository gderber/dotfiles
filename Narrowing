In Emacs terms, '''[::narrowing]''' the [[buffer]] means that you restrict
yourself from accessing anything but a certain part of the current
buffer.  The rest of the buffer is invisible, unreachable, ineditable
(inedible, so to speak).

This is useful when you want to work on one part of the buffer only,
while making sure you can't mess up the other parts of it.  The most
common way to narrow the buffer is `C-x n n' which calls
<code>narrow-to-region</code>.

This is very often used in EmacsLisp code.  It is used whenever a large
file is loaded into memory and only part of it is visible at any given
moment.  Examples: Reading a mail file and displaying one mail at a
time; reading an info file and displaying one node at a time.

A similar effect could be achieved by using text properties, but
narrowing is much easier to use.

In order to undo narrowing, use `C-x n w' which calls the function
<code>widen</code>.

*Note to Emacs Lisp hackers*: The use of <code>widen</code>
in EmacsLisp programs to "temporarily" move to sections of the file, that
some calling code has narrowed away, usually points to some design
problems.  Widening may confuse the calling code.
