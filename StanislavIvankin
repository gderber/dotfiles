I am emacs user. It's my favourite tool almost for everything. :)

Well, nothing to add right now. Maybe someone will be interested in my [http://github.com/grepz/emacsconfigs/tree/master init files].

I saw your dot emacs, I think function `add-subdirs-to-load-path' is you want, it can recursive add directories to `load-path'.
Below the define of `add-subdirs-to-load-path':

{{{
(defun add-subdirs-to-load-path (dir)
  "Recursive add directories to `load-path'."
  (let ((default-directory (file-name-as-directory dir)))
    (add-to-list 'load-path dir)
    (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path)))
}}} -- AndyStewart

Thanks. This function will be useful. Made some changes to dot files loading process. Just interested, is there any library that is trying to load dot files in init.d style ?
