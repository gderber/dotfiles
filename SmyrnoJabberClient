Smyrno was intended to be a Jabber client for Emacs.

Unfortunately, as with many of my other half-finished projects, I will
likely never get it up to speed to be actually useful as such.

Low-level prerequisites for an Elisp XMPP implementation (SAX-like XML
parsing and XML Streams support) which were implemented for Smyrno can
be found here:

* http://edward.oconnor.cx/elisp/xml-event.el
* http://edward.oconnor.cx/elisp/xml-stream.el

These are a good, solid foundation on which further Emacs Jabber work
can be done.

I'm attempting to refactor ERC enough such that it can use XMPP as an
alternate backend protocol, but I make no guarantees that it will ever
be usable as such, or that I'll ever have anything to check into ERC on
this front. (Actually, to be honest I ran out of steam working on Smyrno
because I didn't feel like reinventing all of the wonderful UI work that
ERC embodies, so perhaps I'll eventually get somewhere with this.)
