= visual-regexp =

The project is hosted under GitHub - https://github.com/benma/visual-regexp.el. 

##visual-regexp## for Emacs is like ##replace-regexp## (or ##query-replace-regexp##), but with live visual feedback directly in the buffer.

While constructing the regexp in the minibuffer, you get live visual feedback for the matches, including group matches:

[[image:VisualRegexpSearch]]

While constructing the replacement in the minibuffer, you get live visual feedback for the replacements:
[[image:VisualRegexpReplace]]

= visual-regexp-steroids =

Hosted under https://github.com/benma/visual-regexp-steroids.el/.

This is an extension to ##visual-regexp## which lets you use an external, modern regexp engine for searching and replacing. The package comes with an interface to Python's regexp engine and pcre2el-support out of the box. 

Note the absence of escape characters in the search string:
[[image:VisualRegexpSteroidsSearch]]

Besides having a nicer regexp syntax, you can also use Python expressions for replacements, as seen in the following example:
[[image:VisualRegexpSteroidsExpression]]

The package can also be used to power ##isearch-forward-regexp## and ##isearch-backward-regexp## with a modern regexp engine. See the project page for details.
