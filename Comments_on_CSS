Is there any reason why HTTPS urls for CSS files wouldn't work?

This:

https://raw.github.com/nicferrier/nics-emacswiki-css/master/nicferrier.css

does not work when used in a CSS enabler:

http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?action=browse;id=CSS;css=https://raw.github.com/nicferrier/nics-emacswiki-css/master/nicferrier.css

Are you sure that is the problem? I can't check the MIME type on my phone but that has been a problem for me in the past, for example.

You're right... how frustrating. Did I miss how to upload a CSS file here? I don't notice any instructions.

You can host it anywhere. If I has to be here, use this as an example:

##http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CSS?css=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.communitywiki.org%2Fen%3Faction%3Dbrowse%3Bid%3DCommunityMaintainedCss%3Braw%3D1%3Bmime-type%3Dtext%2Fcss##

* http://www.communitywiki.org/en/CommunityMaintainedCss

* http://www.communitywiki.org/en/raw/CommunityMaintainedCss

Ok... I still don't understand how that helps me upload it to emacswiki?

You just edit a page, of course.

Try it with NicFerrierCss: 
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Comments_on_CSS?css=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.emacswiki.org%2Femacs%3Faction%3Dbrowse%3Bid%3DNicFerrierCss%3Braw%3D1%3Bmime-type%3Dtext%2Fcss

Return:
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Comments_on_CSS?css=
