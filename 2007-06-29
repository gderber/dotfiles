== GPLv3 and LGPLv3 have been released! ==
[[image/right:http://gplv3.fsf.org/gplv3-127x51.png|GPLv3|http://gplv3.fsf.org/]]

From the [http://gplv3.fsf.org/ GPLv3 site]:

: The [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html final text of GPLv3] is accompanied with a rationale document explaining the few changes since the “Last Call” draft. […] Please see our [http://www.fsf.org/news/gplv3_launched press release]. The [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html GPL FAQ] has already been updated with additional information, and we'll continue to improve it over the next few weeks.

I guess this means we should encourage authors of EmacsLisp packages to change their blurb.

Every footer on this wiki mentions and links to the GPL. I think I will replace the GPLv2 with GPLv3.
Anybody disagree?
