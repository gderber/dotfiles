=== Wiki Mission Statement ===

The discussion on the Wiki's MissionStatement page about mentioning non-free software packages is stale and the issue has lost the force it once had.  It seems the Wiki doesn't have an agreed upon mission statement, though there's a /de facto/ and unspoken mission statement we operate on that just isn't formally published.  I've refactored the discussion in hopes of highlighting the positions on the issue.  It would likely be good for the Emacs Wiki community if we could come up with something.  I hope what I developed is both representative and useful.  Any help from others would be appreciated.  I know it's decreased the page's size by half. -- AaronHawley
