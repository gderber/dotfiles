Basically hexl is a standard package for editing and viewing hexadecimal code.

In this page I'll attempt to merely touch on some of the basic functions so that you can experiment and find the best usage for yourself.

There are 2 functions you will mostly be using.  The first is hexl-mode.

hexl-mode translates your current buffer into hex much like any other hex editor would, but doesn't do a very good job of providing editing functions for you.

The second function is hexl-find-file.  This allows you to open up a file and edit the translations.  There are a few other functions, but defining them would be beyond the scope of what I want to do this evening.

These functions come standard with Emacs, I'm not sure if they come with XEmacs or not.

Try it out, and soon you won't have to close emacs to cheat at your favorite games!  :-)

Note that hexl also works only within the EmacsFileSizeLimit.  It is not usable for viewing very large binary files such as movies.

Hexl mode also provides some useful functions for manipulating hex and decimal numbers. Library Lisp:hexrgb.el expands on that, offering functions to convert between hex and decimal RGB color values. -- DrewAdams

I've patched hexl-mode (from emacs22) so that it can group characters in 8, 32 and 64 bit chunks as well
as 16 (the default) `hexl-bits` controls this. You probably want to erase your old hexl customisations
before using this. I've also backported the patched hexl.el to emacs 21.

I have some searching problem in Hexl mode. For example, I want to search a hex number like 04 00 03, but in default hexl mode, I do not know wether to search 0400 03, or 04 0003. so I browse wiki and come here. Does anyone knows how to search it in default hexl mode?
I find the patch above(Thanks fledermaus :) ) is what I want, to change hexl mode's format. I merge it to may Emacs 23(ntemacs 20070819), it works good. 
But, this patch still has some problems: when use hexl-bits 16, all the ADDRESS region and ASCII region have special background face, just like default hexl mode, but when hexl-bits set to 8, 32 or 64, the background property losted. I do not know how to fix it. 
Does anyone can help me? Thanks a lot. :)
I do not know how to upload files, so I can not give you my file. But I think the hexl22.el has the same problem. 

==Alternatives==
HexlMode is too simple: you can't for instance type in hex codes directly, or change the display options. Are there better alternatives?

Of course you can enter hex codes directly in HexlMode: just type C-M-x than the hex code.  
C-h a hexl <RET> will give you all the hexl commands.

Cheers,
Alex.

: Oh no, that's not really ''directly''. I mean type   c a f e   and see 0xCA and 0xFE appear at the left side... Without having to call other functions. Switching between left and right side with a key.

: Open the file with hexl-find-file, navigate to the location that you want to edit, and type characters directly (e.g. "c a f e") -- the hex codes will appear appropriately on the left side.

:: No good. I don't want to enter the word cafe (4 bytes), but 2 bytes (0xCA and 0xFE) by typing only four consecutive letters: c a f e
