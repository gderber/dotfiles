Emacs uses the symbol <code>mouse-1</code> for the first mouse button, while
XEmacs uses the symbol <code>button1</code>.  XEmacs still allows the use of the Emacs symbols for backwards compatibility.  Therefore the following
will also work for both emacsen:

    (global-set-key (kbd "S-<mouse-3>") 'apropos)

For those interested in ComparativeEmacsology -- the expression (kbd
"S-<mouse-3>") yields [S-mouse-3] on Emacs, and [(shift mouse-3)] on
XEmacs.

== Down Events Take Precendence ==

Note however, that for Emacs, a binding for "<S-down-mouse-1>" takes
precedence over a binding for "S-mouse-1".  Always use <code>C-h k</code> to
check whether the "down" event is already bound, if you find that a
set-key statement seems to not work at all.  Example:  Per default
"<S-down-mouse-1>" is bound to <code>mouse-set-font</code>.  The following has no effect:

    (global-set-key (kbd "S-<mouse-1>") 'apropos)

You also need to unset the down event:

    (global-unset-key (kbd "S-<down-mouse-1>"))
