The code for a copy of `insert-date' is shown below.  You can bind it to a key as follows:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d") 'insert-date)

Usage:

* `C-c d': 13.04.2004
* `C-u C-c d': 2004-04-13
* `C-u C-u C-c d': Dienstag, 13. April 2004

Code:

  (defun insert-date (prefix)
    "Insert the current date. With prefix-argument, use ISO format. With
   two prefix arguments, write out the day and month name."
    (interactive "P")
    (let ((format (cond
                   ((not prefix) "%d.%m.%Y")
                   ((equal prefix '(4)) "%Y-%m-%d")
                   ((equal prefix '(16)) "%A, %d. %B %Y")))
          (system-time-locale "de_DE"))
      (insert (format-time-string format))))

This is a piece of code from JorgenSchaefersEmacsConfig - it's very
specifically tailored for my needs. E.g. it explicitly sets a german
locale for the third variant, since I usually don't want german stuff,
except in this special case.

This command prompts the user for a date format:

  (defun insert-date (format)
    "Wrapper around format-time-string." 
    (interactive "MFormat: ")
    (insert (format-time-string format)))

This command will insert the standard date format:

  (defun insert-standard-date ()
    "Inserts standard date time string." 
    (interactive)
    (insert (format-time-string "%c")))

I have something like this bound to a keystroke, so with just a tap-tap, I can insert a timestamp into any document I am editing. --DinoChiesa
