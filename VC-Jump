VC-Jump provides vc-jump, which jumps to the VersionControl status buffer if detected.

== Description ==
`##M-x vc-jump##' jumps to corresponding VC status buffer.

If you're familiar with `##M-x dired-jump##' (or ##C-x C-j##), you might already knew what `##M-x vc-jump##' goes.

For example, if you are visiting a file controlled by CVS, `##M-x vc-jump##' will launch `##cvs-update##' automatically.  If the ##*cvs*## buffer (resulting from `##cvs-update##') already exists, it just switch to ##*cvs*##, and refresh it.

Likewise, if you are visiting a file controlled by GIT, `##M-x vc-jump##' will launch `##git-update##'.

Currently, supported VC backends are CVS, SVN, and GIT.

It is tested on GNU Emacs 23.2.1, git.el from git 1.7.2.2, psvn.el from subversion 1.6.13 on Gentoo Linux system.

== Installing ==

Download [[vc-jump.el]] and place it any directory in `##load-path##'.

In your ~/.emacs,

    (require 'vc-jump)
    (global-set-key [f12] 'vc-jump)    ; for your convenience

I'll be embarassed if this feature is already provided by Emacs.  Let me know if that is the case. -- CinSK
