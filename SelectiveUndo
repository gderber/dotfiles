'''Selective Undo'''

Select an area of text, then press C-u C-_ (undo with a prefix argument). This undoes the last change to the selected region, even if you've later made changes to some other area. You can repeat it. How cool!

Note: if you enable TransientMarkMode temporarily by pressing C-SPC C-SPC, undo will only affect this region.
