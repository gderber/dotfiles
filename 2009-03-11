Grabbing a copy of the [[Rsync repository]], I was able to determine what pages on EmacsWiki mention CategoryHomepage, but aren't listed on CategoryHomepage.  This is something I had done in the past, but here's a concise Bash shell script that does the job.

    find ./emacs/page -type f -name '*.pg' -execdir bash -c 'grep -iqFe CategoryHomepage "$0" \
     && ! grep -qFe CategoryEmacsWikiSite "$0" \
     && echo "$0"' {} \; \
      | while read userpage; do \
          username="$(basename "${userpage}" .pg)"; \
          grep -qFe "${username}" ./emacs/page/C/CategoryHomepage.pg \
            || grep -qFe "$(echo "${username}" | tr _ ' ')" \
                         ./emacs/page/C/CategoryHomepage.pg \
            || echo "${username}"; \
        done

Today, the result was over 150 pages.  Some pages mention CategoryHomepage, but are not actually UserName pages -- for example, consider SiteMap.  I went through and grabbed the obvious UserName''''''s, and added them to CategoryHomepage.  Please review [EmacsWiki:diff=2;id=CategoryHomepage;diffrevision=656;revision=657 revision 657] to make sure there aren't any false positives -- pages that aren't actually UserName pages.

I've also added some Emacs Lisp code to maintain the alpha-order of the entries on the page.  It is located at AlphabetizeHomepageList.

Congratulations on EmacsWiki having over 800 users on the wiki!  Who's going to be user 1000?  What should they win as a prize? -- AaronHawley
