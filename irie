I use Emacs.

== Programs I wrote ==

* [ScimBridge scim-bridge.el] -- SCIM-Bridge client for GNU Emacs
* [IBusMode ibus.el] -- IBus client for GNU Emacs
* [RedoPlus redo+.el] -- a fork of redo.el which can correctly work in newer version of Emacs
* [PosTip pos-tip.el] -- a library for easily showing tooltip at arbitrary buffer position
* [TransEJ trans-ej.el] -- English-Japanese translator using multiple Web translation services
* [MenuTree menu-tree.el] -- Localize menu-bar items (Originally written by YAGI Tatsuya)
* [GrabAndDrag grab-and-drag.el] -- Scroll a window by mouse dragging
* [TransposeFrame transpose-frame.el] -- Transpose windows arrangement in a frame
* etc.

== Web sites I maintain ==

Hi, Irie, remember me? :) -- AndyStewart
: Yes, of course. How are you? -- [[irie]]
:: Not bad, long time no see. :) scim-bridge.el is awesome, do you want write an Emacs interface for [http://code.google.com/p/ibus/ ibus] ? -- AndyStewart
::: I'm interested in iBus interface, but it seems quite hard to implement. -- [[irie]]

I found grab-drag.el very nice to use on a lenovo x201t tablet pc! Can we also look forward to more gestures and multi-touch support in the future? -- JoakimVerona
: Thanks! Umm... multi-touch support seems difficult unless Emacs can detect multi-touch event. -- [[irie]]
