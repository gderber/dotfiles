=Loading remote libraries=

*Warning*: Evaluating remote source code can be a security risk to your computer.


By defining the following functions you'll be able to load files located
on remote web servers, in this instance the ElispArea.  This requires HttpGet.

    (defvar http-default-url "http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/download/")

    (defun http-load-file (url)
      (interactive "surl: ")
      (let ((buf (process-buffer (http-get url  nil nil nil "*temp.el"))))
        (sleep-for 5)
        (eval-buffer buf)
        (kill-buffer buf)))

    (defun http-require (feature &optional url)
      (if (not (featurep feature))
          (http-load-file (if url url
                            (concat http-default-url (symbol-name feature) ".el")))))

==Usage examples==
To load the latest version of MenuBarPlus you would type
##M-x http-load-file RET http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/download/menu-bar+.el##.
.

Or you could put either

    (http-load-file "http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/download/menu-bar+.el")

or

    (http-require 'menu-bar+)

in your ##~/.emacs## to have it loaded every time you start emacs.
