==Overview==

Test the content of a value.

==Quickstart==

    (require 'truthy)
 
    (truthy "")                   ; nil
    (truthy '[])                  ; nil
    (truthy 0)                    ; nil
    (truthy (lambda ()))          ; nil
    (truthy (make-sparse-keymap)) ; nil
    (truthy 1)                    ; t
    (truthy '(a b c))             ; t
    (truthy '(nil nil nil))       ; nil

==Explanation==

This library has no user-level interface; it is only useful
for programming in Emacs Lisp.  Two functions are provided:

    `truthy'
    `truthy-s'

Truthy provides an alternative measure of the "truthiness" of a
value.  Whereas Lisp considers any non-nil value to be "true" when
evaluating a Boolean condition, `truthy' considers a value to be
"true" if it has *content*.  If the value is a string or buffer, it
must have non-zero length.  If a number, it must be non-zero.  If a
hash, it must have keys.  If a window, it must be live.  See the
docstring to `truthy' for more details.

To use truthy, place the truthy.el library somewhere Emacs can find
it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'truthy)

==Availability==

truthy.el is available at github:
