You can use `C-x v d' (or `C-u C-x v d'?) for a recursive directory listing of all the files in RCS or CVS.  (You might have to use `v t' in the listing to display even the non-locked files.)

You could then check out all the files, use `Q' to do the replace in all files, then check them all in again.  Optimizing this so that only those files are checked out that contain the string is a little more difficult, but not at all impossible.

To check out all the files, mark them and do `v v'.  To check them in again, do the same.
