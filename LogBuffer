Lisp:log-buffer.el

The purpose of this file is just to help the logging of information.
The first feature of a log-window is: read-only. 
The second is: if the cursor is at the bottom of the text, the windows
scrolls automatically.

; ''make-new-log-buffer'': create a read-only buffer to log the code
; ''log-printf'':          do a c-style printf in the log buffer
                           also scroll the buffer to the bottom if the cursor
                           was at the end of it.

e.g:

   (make-new-log-buffer "*test*")
   (log-printf "*test*" "this is a test!!!\n")
   (log-printf "*test*" "a text of %s and number like %i\n" "string" 12)
   (log-printf "*test*" "Test\nof\nmultiple\nlines\nof\ntext\ndisplayed\nat\nonce..\nto\nsee\nif\nthe\nscrolling\nis\nstill\nok\n")
