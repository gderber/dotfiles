==What's is ChmView==
: ChmView is a mode to view CHM files in Emacs.

: It is based on "archmage". 
:: (archmage is a program that acts as  HTTP server on specified port number, so you can read CHM file with your favorite browser.)
:: And ChmView integrates "archmage" with Emacs, you can use [[emacs-w3m]] (or any browser you like) to browse a CHM file.

==Install==
* Install archmage:
: ChmView is based on archmage(1) so make sure you have it installed on your system. On a Debian-based OS :
:: sudo aptitude install archmage

* Install the elisp file:
: Put Lisp:chm-view.el in your load-path, and add 
:: (require 'chm-view)
: in ~/.emacs

==Setup==
: I recommend you install [[emacs-w3m]], and setup the variable  `browse-url-browser-function' with the value `w3m-browse-url', then you can view a CHM file in Emacs!
Like below:
:: (setq browse-url-browser-function 'w3m-browse-url)

==Usage==
* View CHM file:
: You can use the command `chm-view-file' to view a CHM file in the browser.

* Integrate with dired:
: You can bind the command `chm-view-dired' with `dired-mode-map', so that you can view a CHM file that is marked in a dired buffer.

==Note==
: Because `archmage' needs time to extract the CHM file, the browser (such as [[emacs-w3m]]) might open a special port before the `archmage' extract is completed. If this occurs,  you will get an error: "Cannot retrieve URL: http://localhost:531560 (exit status: 0)". Just refresh the current page to fix this issue.
: If you always get this error when opening a CHM file, you need to set 'chm-view-delay' to a larger number (default is 0.3 seconds).

==Customize==
: All above setup can customized using
: ##M-x customize-group RET chm-view RET##

* `chm-view-delay' 
:: The delay time before view CHM file.
:: This is necessary spend time start sub-process.
