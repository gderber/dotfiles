Library ##mb-depth.el## provides an indicator in the [[minibuffer]] of the current minibuffer depth. That is, when recursive minibuffers are used, you can see what the current depth (level) is. Just turn on `minibuffer-depth-indicator-mode' by putting this in your [[init file]]:

  (minibuffer-depth-indicate-mode 99)

Starting with Emacs 23, ##mb-depth.el## is included as part of GnuEmacs. It also works with Emacs 22, however. You can download it separately from Emacs's sources at:

* GIT:mb-depth.el

Library <tt>[[mb-depth+.el]]</tt> enhances ##mb-depth.el## by letting you customize the depth indicator and its face (they are hard-coded in ##mb-depth.el##).
