SESE is a small utility I wrote for creating subtitles for a movie.

It's inspired by [http://www.1010.co.uk/gneve.html GNEVE].  GNEVE promises
to do much more than what I needed, but the generated subtitles didn't work
fine for me (timing was totally wrong) so I decided to write my own little
tool.

SESE is very convenient and easy to useâ€”you just watch the movie and press a
shortcut to insert subtitles at appropriate position.

I wrote some documentation here: http://mihai.bazon.net/projects/sese

Hope it will be useful to others too. ;-)
