Hey guys.

RepetitionDetection sounds like a good idea.

But...

1. I'm wary of frobbing pre-command-hook.
2. I would like the system to detect any length sub-key-sequence.
3. and I'm OK with it not being real-time.

And since I don't have a job, I get to hack on this all day. <tt>:)</tt>
So I started working on a longest-repeated-substring detector (with a suffix tree) to run on dribble files.
The idea is, you'll `open-dribble-file' at the top of your .emacs.
After a few days or whatever of playing, you run the analysis tool thingy, which will report to you in descending order the longest repeated sub-key-sequences you typed.
At this point, you could have some mechanism for auto-macroizing them or some such.

So, anyway, I'll post dribble-x.el once I have a preliminary version working.
