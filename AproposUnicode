This page is about library '''<tt>[[apu.el]]</tt>''', which provides apropos help for Unicode characters.

Command `apropos-unicode' shows you the Unicode characters that
match an apropos pattern you specify: a regexp or a
space-separated list of words.  The characters whose names match
are shown in a help buffer, along with the names and code points
(decimal and hex).

In the help buffer, you can use these keys to act on the character
described on the current line:

* `RET' or `mouse-2' - see detailed information about it.
* `i' - google for more information about it.
* `^' - insert it in the buffer where you invoked `apropos-unicode'.
* `c' - define a command to insert the character, having the same name.   (You need library <tt>[[ucs-cmds.el]]</tt> for this.)
* `k' - globally bind a key to insert it.
* `l' - locally bind a key to insert it
* `M-w' - copy it to the `kill-ring'.
* `M-y' - copy it to the secondary selection.

Some simple tips for matching some common Unicode character names:

* You can match chars that have a given base char, such as `e', by
  using a regexp `## \(BASE-CHAR \|$\)##'.  That matches ##BASE-CHAR## after a
  `SPC' char and before a `SPC' char or at the end of the line.
* You can use `small letter' to match lowercase letters, and `capital letter' to match capital letters.  Just `small' matches lots of
  chars that are not letters.  Just `capital' matches chars that
  include capital letters that serve as math symbols and such.
