The question was: Is there an easy way to do a delimited search and replace?

In other words, one would like to replace the prefix
and suffix of a given pattern while leaving the middle
bits alone.

For example, suppose one wanted to replace occurrences of

 filbert[(i+1)*8.4-(a*t)]

with

 george((i+1)*8.4-(a*t))

or vice versa?

Naively one would issue

  M-% filbert[ RET george( RET

and then go back and change the appropriate <code>]'</code>s to <code>)'</code>s by hand -- very error prone and time consuming.

The answer is to use a RegexpGroup to save the middle bits, viz,

 C-M-% filbert\[\([^]]*\)\] RET george(\1) RET
