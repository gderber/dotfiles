Maintainer of sql.el [[SqlMode]]

I'm always interested in hearing from fellow Emacs and/or sql.el users:

* Workflows from other Emacs/SQL-mode users (I use sql-mode like this:...)
* Product specific keywords for font-lock.  I try to stay on top of Free databases (Sqlite, Postgres, !MySQL/!MariaDB) but don't have time for other vendor products.  I do use Oracle professionally so I do tend to keep that more up-to-date.  Assistance with other tools is always appreciated.
* Bugs or disruptive or unanticipated behavior.
* Code samples related to workflow convenience, indenting, or completion.  Obviously, larger contributions may require an FSF copyright assignment covering the submission to Emacs.
* Small cash gifts ;-)   Actually, large cash gifts are welcome too!

I use GNU Emacs and sql.el to develop software in a data warehouse environment.  Much of my day is spent with the Emacs frame full screen on my monitor with Eshell, shell, and SQL/SQLi buffers.  My co-workers are always when they discover I can edit scripts on our servers directly from my desktop using [[TrampMode]] and not have to start a terminal session, log in and fire up ##vi##.  Unfortunately, I am stuck with a non-Free desktop currently, but [http://www.cygwin.com Cygwin] and it's new Emacs-w32 package (Cygwin memory, file and process management, W32 window, font interface; faster and lighter-weight that the emacs-x11 package), make life very bearable.  

I keep the bulk of my Emacs customization's on a personal [http://www.ownCloud.com ownCloud] directory that is synced between my professional installations and my home computers.  Each site has a small ##~/.emacs.d/init.el## which invokes the scripts in my cloud directory.  This allows me to drag 20+ years of Emacs cruft along with me so that I am immediately functional at a client site.

I can be reached at mailto:Michael@Mauger.com (or my still active, older address mailto:mmaug@yahoo.com)

I also actively read the emacs-devel ([[EmacsMailingLists]]) mailing lists.
