This program provides some interactive functions in order that we can easily request the text translation between English and Japanese to multiple Web translation services. These functions were implemented using `url-retrieve', so the responses will be displayed asynchronously in the popup window.

This program is tested on GNU Emacs 22, 23.

== Downloading ==

: Lisp:trans-ej.el
: [[https://code.launchpad.net/~irie/+junk/trans-ej.el Bazaar branch in Launchpad]]

== Installation ==

First, save this file as trans-ej.el and byte-compile in a directory that is listed in load-path.

Put the following in your .emacs file:

 (require 'trans-ej)

== Usage ==

To translate the buffer text, select region you desire, and just type as:

 M-x trans-ej

Have fun!

== Display results by tooltip ==

If you want to display the results of `trans-ej' command in a tooltip instead of a buffer popped up, install [PosTip postip.el] and add the following to .emacs file:

 (require 'pos-tip)
 (setq trans-ej-string-all-display-function nil
       trans-ej-string-all-update-function
       (lambda (buf)
         (pos-tip-show (with-current-buffer buf (buffer-string))
                       nil nil nil 0 80)))

: Yeah, of course I've known it. I created this program in order to test `url-retrieve'. -- [[irie]]
