;;; CODE:

(server-start)
;; (setq debug-on-error t) 

;; Replace <LOCAL-PATH-TO> below with an appropriate path to these files.

;; Where MON stores elisp that encapsulates private user data. 
;; This allows exposing more code in public forums:
;;
(load-file "<LOCAL-PATH-TO>/mon-site-local-defaults.el")

;; Bootstrap core load-paths.
;; The constants/variables established are needed across all MON systems.
;; 
(load-file "<LOCAL-PATH-TO>/mon-default-loads.el")

;; Finish loading required packages and site-local procedures.
;; The here routines are evaluated conditional to current MON system. 
;;
(load-file "<LOCAL-PATH-TO>/mon-default-start-loads.el")
