[[fr:Frames Speciaux]]

'''This page is part of the description of OneOnOneEmacs, by DrewAdams.'''

Emacs lets you "make certain chosen buffers, for which Emacs normally
creates a second window when you have just one window, appear in
special [[Frame]]s of their own" (from the EmacsManual). 

So, I did. This may not have a grand utility, but it does make it clear
when a special buffer is involved -- and you can give these special
frames different properties from normal frames. 
Here is a screenshot of a frame for a special buffer (<code>*Occur*</code>) and a normal buffer (<code>elect-mbuf.el</code>):

More importantly,
perhaps: special buffers are effectively in ''dedicated frames'' (you
cannot dissociate the buffer and its frame).

So, what's a "'''[::special buffer]'''" (aka '''[::special display buffer]''')? Any buffer that corresponds to
`special-display-regexps' or
`special-display-buffer-names'. In my case,
`special-display-regexps' is just
<code>"[ ]?[*][^*]+[*]"</code>, so buffers that start and end 
with an asterisk (<code>*</code>) are displayed in special frames.
Examples:
<code>*grep*</code>, <code>*Messages*</code>, <code>*scratch*</code>.

Special frames are similar to ''dedicated'' Emacs windows (windows
satisfying predicate `window-dedicated-p'): function
`display-buffer' does not use a window or frame that is
dedicated to its buffer to display a different buffer.

Treating frames the way windows are usually treated also meant
modifying a few existing functions that treat dedicated windows
specially. For example, I modified command
`Buffer-menu-select' so that it uses
`pop-to-buffer' (which uses a new frame, provided
`pop-to-frames' is non-nil) whenever a window is
dedicated to its buffer (`window-dedicated-p').

= Invisible Special Frames =

Since special frames are dedicated to their buffers, it doesn't make
much sense to delete them. An alternative to iconifying them when they
are no longer needed is to make them ''invisible''. An '''invisible
frame''' is just what the name says: it is neither visible nor
iconified -- ''nothing'' representing it is visible.

I modified several commands to make special frames invisible instead
of deleting them or iconifying them.

For example, command `remove-window' is like
`delete-window', but it treats one-on-one windows this
way: If the window is dedicated to its buffer, then its frame is made
invisible. Otherwise, its frame (as well as the window) is deleted.
`remove-window' is the command I use to replace
`delete-window' interactively (even my redefined version -- 
see [[Delete Frames Easily - But Not Too Easily#Redefineddelete-window]]):

  (substitute-key-definition 'delete-window
                             'remove-window
                             global-map))

Command `mouse-remove-window' (<code>[mode-line
C-mouse-3]</code>) is the mouse equivalent of
`remove-window'.

The `special-display-regexps' and`special-display-buffer-names' are obsolete since GNU Emacs 24.3, as they can be replaced by
appropriate entries in the `display-buffer-alist' function. -- XueFuqiao
