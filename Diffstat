Diffstat is a simple Emacs lisp implementation of [http://invisible-island.net/diffstat/ diffstat utility]. It is useful in reviewing large and complicated diff files.

DiffMode is a really nice mode. However, for the large patch/diff files, which contain changes across many files, it is not easy to see the overall changes. As VersionControl(vc-mode) relies on DiffMode, this situation can happen quite often. Diffstat will solve this problem.

== How to use ==

Add followings in your .emacs:
{{{
;; (require 'diffstat)
;; (add-hook 'diff-mode-hook (lambda () (local-set-key "\C-c\C-l" 'diffstat)))
}}}

In any diff-mode buffer, for example after vc-diff, press C-c C-l to show diffstat. In diffstat-mode buffer, press C-c C-l or C-c C-c to go back to the diff buffer and move to the beginning of diff line corresponding to the file on the point.

[new:PhilHudson:2011-09-04 20:15 UTC]Seems not to work with DistributedVersionControl's ##dvc-diff-mode##, the docstring of which /says/ it extends DiffMode. In fact ##dvc-diff-mode## extends ##fundamental-mode##, so it's not surprising. Looks like the bug may be in DVC, not this file. 

[new:HansJang:2011-09-04 23:12 UTC] diffstat seemed to be too restrictive. Fixed now. Thanks. -- Hans.
