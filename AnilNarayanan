I became a believer in Jan 2004 (thanks to [[alephnull]]).

Just like most believers I use emacs to edit text also. Mostly I use gnus, erc, muse 
(emacs-wiki at work), planner (which replaced the diary and to-do), dired. I don't use 
elisp much. Recent attempt was making a gnus hook to make my mail multipart with html
versions (it worked!). 

My interests include (playing) computer games (fps, rpg, flight sim), 3d modelling, ascii-art,
a bit of programming computer games (yeah, the usually newbie interest, stuck to me). My homepage 
is [http://hcoop.net/~anil/ here] and I hang around (mostly lurking) in #emacs as [::aniline].
