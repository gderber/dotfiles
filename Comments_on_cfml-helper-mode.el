Could someone with admin rights please remove all provided features except the correct one. It seems I cannot edit this because there are three consecutive lines of whitespace. Is it that really a good idea?

Done -- I commented out all of the `provide's except the first.  What that what you intended?

You should ask Alex for admin rights, I would think.

(I can't answer the question about the 3+ consecutive blank lines.)

Yeah, I'll comment the "three links" spam rule.

Alex: Did you actually comment that rule?

Here are two more files that need fixing StripeBuffer and PowerLine. I added a space between the protocol and the rest of the url. (When I just tried doing the same here it did not work; the spam rule still kicked in.)

The message should list the rule it triggers. You can then find the rules on BannedContent and BannedRegexps.
