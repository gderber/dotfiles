I use Emacs. I've been using it for the longest time and I can't really remember when it started. Like you probably, I have a "~/.emacs" that is way too large, and I'm sorting out some of the stuff I wrote and contributing here.

On this wiki I published a [[CategoryProgrammerUtils|programer util]] called [[Profiles]]. It helps you in the same way as [[dirvars.el|directory variables]] does, with a different, more generic and less invasive, approach.
