Wohoo, we're in 2015! Happy New Year!

NicFerrier and I have been busy setting up a new site. It is paid for and maintained by Nic. It uses nginx as a caching proxy with some pretty aggressive caching rules.
If you're editing a page, however, and once you have edited a page, you should be bypassing the cache and everything should work as it used to do.

I'm still looking at [https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/Emacs_Wiki_Migration my backlog] of things to do. All I have to do is test this git backend. If it works, we're ready to make the wiki editable again.

/Time passes.../

Done! The site is editable again.

Things to watch out for:
# Caching issues. The new setup involves a lot of caching.
# Lost edits. I don't think we lost any edits in our move, but one never knows.
