Ask questions, answer questions, build up your reputation. Have fun!

There are multiple %%StackExchange%% sites for Emacs questions. 
The main two sites are these. Each has about the same amount of traffic and equally interesting questions and answers:

* [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/ Emacs.StackExchange]]

* [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/emacs StackOverflow, tag `emacs']] (just add tag '''##emacs##''' when you post a question)

But you will also find Emacs Q & A on other %%StackExchange%% sites, such as [[http://superuser.com/questions/tagged/emacs Super User]].

You can filter using tag `emacs' across any number of %%StackExchange%% sites, to pick up Emacs questions that are not on [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/ Emacs.StackExchange]]
