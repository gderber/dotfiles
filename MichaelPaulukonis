[[http://michaelpaulukonis.com|Michael Paulukonis]] often refers to himself in the third person. He is also known as (the) Other Michael.
Unsurprisingly for somebody who has a user-page in this wiki, he uses Emacs.

But only since the summer of 2007, and mainly on [[EmacsW32|Windows]].

He can also be found online at http://michaelpaulukonis.com/ and http://www.xradiograph.com/Emacs

He's a member of the FSF -- and [[http://www.fsf.org/register_form?referrer=8082 you should be, too]] (especially if you use Emacs) !

== Projects ==
[:todo]
=== TODOs ===
* look at MiniMap
* look at PrintWithWebBrowser, which cites <code>browse-url-of-file</code>
** page needs cleanup
** mentions some functions I'd like to know
* look at WikiModes
* [[CSS]]
** look into darkstrap
** look into variant on [EmacsWiki:action=browse;bootstrap=0;id=CSS;css=/css/pedia.css wikipedia css] -- I like how the layout works, just not the stark-white fluorscently-lit colors (it's like a website at walmart)
** [EmacsWiki:action=browse;bootstrap=1;id=MichaelPaulukonis reset CSS]
* whee! [[CategoryGames|games!]] I didn't know most of these existed. As if I'd have the time....
* do git from w/in Emacs?
** get list of pages, incl. GitCommitMode
** Magit
* look at EmacsScreencasts
* look at GuileEmacs
* look at EmacsPortableApp
* opening and closing frames.
** seriously. Why have you been missing out this whole time?!?!?
** <code>C-x 5 2</code> new frame
** CategoryFrames
** [[Frame]]
* EmacsSuperCollider
** might finally start working in SC
** Isn't the prefix "Emacs" redundant?

=== DropBox ===
* look at DropBox notes -- implement, test, and update page
* I've been using DropBox for years, and Emacs, and never investigate the full potential
* I believe I saw something about TODOs in Emacs and dropbox in the soi-distant past....
* my notes @ http://www.xradiograph.com/Programming/DropBox
* and this [[https://twitter.com/noahsussman/status/969924361 cryptic, pregnant tweet]]

=== deftheme ===
==== Theme handling system ====
<code>deftheme</code> is the theme-handling system introduced in Emacs 23, and enhanced in Emacs 24.
As such, it is something of a replacement for ColorTheme.

[quote]Emacs 24 finally introduced a new standard way of dealing with color themes (based on Emacs’s built-in customize facility). While it doesn’t have a proper name (as far as I know) it’s commonly referred to as the deftheme facility, since deftheme is the name of the macro you’d use to create such a theme. -[[http://batsov.com/articles/2012/02/19/color-theming-in-emacs-reloaded/ source]][/quote]

==== provided themes ====
By default Emacs24 comes with several themes.

==== Adding new themes ====
You can add more.... somehow....

==== Switching Themes ====
* Switching themes does not //roll-back// changes applied in a theme. You need to disable the current (or any previously applied) themes to have a blank slate.
* [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9900232/changing-color-themes-emacs-24-order-matters order matters]]

==== See Also ====
* Further information at http://batsov.com/articles/2012/02/19/color-theming-in-emacs-reloaded/
* http://emacsfodder.github.io/blog/notes-on-deftheme/
* http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/08/21/color-themes-redux/ where he's _still_ calling it <code>deftheme</code> in late 2013.

==== standalone page ====
* This was [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=browse;id=DefTheme;revision=2 its own page]] for a while, but selected elements were merged into the page for the ColorTheme package.
** but added were some notes on how <code>deftheme</code> ("Custom Themes") differed from ColorTheme (can't roll-back changes applied in <code>deftheme</code> for instance).
** Doesn't make sense to me, since ColorTheme is a specific package, and the notes on using <code>deftheme</code> have nothing to do with that package.


=== re-org(ing) my init-file(s) ===
* IN-PROGRESS as of 2013.07
*** see https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/dot-emacs
* some things to stare at
** https://github.com/ghoseb/dotemacs and https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live
** http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3968124/sacha-emacs.html
** http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/DL/elisp/dot-emacs/
*** I like the message-dumping


=== tetris ===
* I wanted to tweak tetris. But most things appear to be untweakable without tweaking all over the place. tsk tsk.
* so, see https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/tetris.el - which as of 2013.07.18 is the original version with no tweaks.
* http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/31390/is-it-possible-to-change-the-keyboard-controls-in-emacs-tetris

=== OrgMode ===
* learning and using....
* reading:
** http://swaroopch.com/2013/01/16/orgmode/
* writing
** http://www.xradiograph.com/Emacs/OrgMode
** http://www.xradiograph.com/Emacs/Journal

=== pmwiki-mode ===
* hoping to work on pmwiki-mode
* started up an org/repo @ https://github.com/emacs-pmwiki-mode
* need to start an Emacswiki page for it....

=== journal ===
* [[Journal]] - I use a modified version of this.
** created a repo @ https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/fisler-journal.el
*** contains original code as found @ [[Journal]] and my modifications
** TODO: Clean up code, prefix-space ("namespace") the code, and fix the issues
** I'm migrating over to use org-mode, but I used [[Journal]] for about 6 years; I have a lot of fondness for it
** and it's influenced how I ''want'' to work with org-mode (which may not be how I ''should'' work with org-mode)

=== emacs-wiki work ===
* working on documentation within CategoryJavaScript
** see my random blog notes on [http://www.xradiograph.com/interference/tag/emacs-js/|emacs.js]

=== Gravatar from Emacs ===

The [[#gravatar|image at top]] is my [[http://gravatar.com|Gravatar]]. It's a useful service that ties an email address to an image, so if someone gives you an email you can maybe find a picture of them.

You need to hash the email to generate the url though, here's how in EmacsLisp:

{{{
(print (md5 (downcase "me@mail.com")) (current-buffer))
}}}

and the markup:

    portrait:http://gravatar.com/avatar/2c387befb1ee085fd6706bd59efa042f

Once you define it with that markup, it will now display w/in the wiki when your user-name is referenced in certain contexts
For example: <code>MichaelPaulukonis</code> and <code>[MichaelPaulukonis]</code> do not render, but <code>[new:MichaelPaulukonis:2013-05-13 13:28 UTC]</code> is displaying, but <code>[new:MichaelPaulukonis 2013-06-11 13:54 UTC]</code> (colon replaced with space) is NOT displaying.

[new:MichaelPaulukonis:2013-06-11 13:54 UTC]

[new:MichaelPaulukonis 2013-06-11 13:54 UTC]

[new:MichaelPaulukonis :2013-06-11 13:56 UTC]

Can't find any notes on this, yet, other than what I blatantly stole from [[NicFerrier]].
