Chong suggested changing the font-lock-* faces colors, see http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-07/msg01577.html.

I checked the WAC guidelines at http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast and wrote a file for checking Emacs font-lock-* face colors:

Lisp:font-lock-color-test.el

This file contains Chongs suggestion and a test of the contrast they gives.
I have also added my own suggestions.
To see those suggestions, load the file and enable font-colors

  S-M-: (with-temp-buffer (url-insert-file-contents "https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/font-lock-color-test.el") (eval-buffer))
  M-x flct-show-colors-suggestions

To reset, eval following code:

  S-M-: (progn (flct-use-suggestion "lennart1") (sit-for 2) (flct-use-suggestion "chong") (sit-for 2) (flct-reset-faces-default-colors))

You are welcome to add your own suggestions to this file.
