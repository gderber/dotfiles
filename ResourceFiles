Some Emacs settings, such as colors, fonts and faces can be set via
''X resources'', which reside in a hierarchial database (X Resource
Database, or ''XRDB'') handled by the X11 server.

== Example ==

The usual way to
set it up is via the ##.Xdefaults## file.  Here is a sample entry:

{{{
Emacs*Background: DarkSlateGray
Emacs*Foreground: wheat
}}}

There are many more resource names, see the EmacsLispReference for details.
The resource class ''Emacs'' is common for both GnuEmacs and XEmacs.
See HowtoChangeFrameColors for other ways to change the frame colors.

== Console ==

If you're using Emacs in a terminal, then you might find that blue on black
is hard to read. In which case you can change the colors used by the
terminal emulator:

{{{
*color4: #204a87
}}}

== A Mode ==

Needless to say, a mode exists for editing ResourceFiles, and it's
called 'xrdb-mode.el'.  See WikifiedEmacsLispList for it.

== Technical Details ==

Emacs faces can be configured by setting resources of the form
'''Emacs'''.''face''.'''attribute'''''Attrib'',
f.ex. <code>Emacs.italic.attributeColor: yellow</code>.  At least in
GnuEmacs 21.2.1 a ProblemSettingCertainFaceAttributesFromXResources
exists, but elisp patch exists for it.

Changes to your .Xdefaults file have no effect straight away, as it's
just a file on a disk.  The concents must be merged into the X11
servers database with '''xrdb'''(1x) program (the xrdb-mode has a
command for this, the
<code>xrdb-database-merge-buffer-or-region</code>, bound to <code>C-c
C-c</code> by default).  The X11 clients usually only receive their
resources on startup, so you must either restart your Emacs, or
specifically tell it to update from the resource database with
EmacsLisp.  One handy way to test resources without the edit/merge
cycle is the general command-line parameter <code>--xrm</code> which
is recognized by all well-behaved X11 programs (well, they use one
dash only).

In addition to the resources from the XRDB (which isn't a resource
file at all, but is initialized from them) Emacs, again like all
well-behaved X11 programs, reads an application specific resourcefile
(often called ''app-defaults'' files) for more resources.  See the
manual-page '''X'''(7).

The XRDB is usually initialized automatically when your X session
starts.  Here is some background information:

If I remember my X11R4 conventions correctly...

If you use xdm to manage your X display then the default system
start-up script looks for a file called .Xdefaults and ~/.xsession
for personal customizations (this is just a shell script which runs
the window manager, clock and emacs; you can explicitly load your X
resources with xrdb in this file).

If you login via console and start X with startx, then the file
.Xresources is loaded by the default system start-up script and your
personal customizations file is called ~/.xinitrc.

NB: you should never run X stuff in your .(bash|csh|z)rc file.
