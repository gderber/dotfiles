rcircLisppaste is a rcirc extension.

When in a rcirc multiline mode buffer, you can now submit your buffer content directly on lisppaste with current channel, nick and a title.

Code:
<pre>
(defun rcirc-multiline-minor-send-to-lisppaste ()
  "Send the text in buffer back to lisppaste."
  (interactive "sTitle: ")
  (assert rcirc-parent-buffer)
  (untabify (point-min) (point-max))
  (let ((text (buffer-substring (point-min) (point-max)))
          (buffer (current-buffer))
          (pos (point)))
      ;; We need some informations here
      (with-current-buffer rcirc-parent-buffer
        (let ((nick rcirc-nick)
              (channel rcirc-target))
          (xml-rpc-method-call "http://common-lisp.net:8185/RPC2" 'newpaste
                               channel nick title text)))
      (set-buffer rcirc-parent-buffer)
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (kill-buffer buffer)
      (set-window-configuration rcirc-window-configuration)
      (goto-char (+ rcirc-prompt-end-marker (1- pos)))))
</pre>

Bind this onto rcirc-multiline-minor-mode-map with this (for example):

<pre>
(define-key rcirc-multiline-minor-mode-map
  (kbd "C-c C-l") 'rcirc-multiline-minor-send-to-lisppaste)
</pre>

Questions:

[new]
Is there a reason you're not using an interactive form? This would facilitate calling the defun from lisp itself.

[new]
No there is no reason :) I just did this really quickly. Fixing it.

And what's the connection to [[rcircBack]]? This page had a "see also" pointer to the other page, but there seems to be no connection at all. -- AlexSchroeder

No reason too :)
