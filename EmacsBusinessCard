This is a businesscard CD containing Emacs -- ready to boot, including
Linux, some tools, and X.  It is based on LNX-BBC, a small rescue and
debugging system on a businesscard CD -- the same you get as your FSF
membership card.  You can get the 50MB ISO image; mailto:alex@emacswiki.org.

For the source code of the entire system (ie. not including the exact
configuration used for the above image), check out the LNX-BBC site.
This is also the site where you will find more information about the
businesscard-sized CDs.

Known problems:

# On the console, you can switch keymaps using `loadkeys', but the
  output remains 7bit, so no German Umlauts.  In Emacs, you can type
  umlauts using `C-x 8 " o' for example, or use input methods such as
  latin-1-prefix.

Features:

# Emacs 21.3 including input-methods, elisp sources and info files.
# Latin-1 fonts, Japanese fonts.
