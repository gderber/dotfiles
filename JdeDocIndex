The jde-docindex package provides a quick and convenient interface to javadoc directly within Emacs.

You can see description and get sources from http://www.peerfear.org/jde-docindex/

ArjenWiersma: Looks like this site is gone... I am getting (3-nov-2005) a links only site now... 

I did a search on the Internet. It looks like jde-docindex has been on freshmeat.net. 
I asked on freshmeat.net about it and Daniel Pearson kindly replied that they do not know anything about it now.

I have also asked on the gnu-emacs-help list, but there are no replies yet.

Perhaps someone has this package locally and can put it up here or elsewhere so that we might still be able to find it.. I was actually looking for this functionality :(

Since no one has replied I am starting to wonder if perhaps this functionality is included in JDEE (ie JavaDevelopmentEnvironment which I have not had time to look into yet)?

I don't think it is part of JDEE. I have version 0.93. Here is what the comment section says:
<pre>
 This is a package for the jde which supports building javadoc, exporting it
 to .info files and installing the relevant content into the Emacs info
 system.  The nice thing is that this provides a *quick* and nice interface to
 javadoc without having to resort to using Mozilla and also using completion.
</pre>
Last time I tried it didn't work. The maintainer is listed in the package, I will drop him a note.

One more thing: JDEE knows how to find a HTML JavaDoc page from a class name (at point or not), either locally or from a web site. I use w3m to read JavaDoc inside Emacs and it works quite well.

I've been unable to upload the version 0.9.3 of jde-docindex directly. Meanwhile, I've made it available through a temporary url [1].
