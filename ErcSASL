= Connect to servers that allow authenticating with SASL =
JosephGay has a patched version of [[ERC]] with SASL support on GitHub.

https://github.com/joseph-gay/erc-sasl


The important file to get is https://github.com/joseph-gay/erc-sasl/blob/sasl/erc-sasl.el

When you've put either his [[ERC]] or the erc-sasl in your load-path edit your [[.emacs]] with

  (require 'erc-sasl)
  (add-to-list 'erc-sasl-server-regexp-list "host\\.server\\.com") ;; e.g. irc\\.freenode\\.net, or .* for any host

You'll need to initially pass a password to Erc for authentication.

Update: There is also a small modification to the function erc-login required for erc-sasl to work. This is the reason for cloning the entire ERC repo. Pending a few modifications, I hope to have this merged.
