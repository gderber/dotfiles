The Authinfo library provides ##authinfo-copy-password## which allows you to copy a password from your ##~/.authinfo.gpg## file, for 10s.
You provide the hostname, with completion, and the username, with completion, if necessary, and the code will copy the password into the
kill-ring and the system clipboard. After 10s of idletime, it will be purged.

This uses the ##auth-source## library which does the parsing and searching of your ##~/.authinfo.gpg## file.
Note that the variable ##auth-source-cache-expiry## says how long it caches its data, defaulting to 2h.
As far as I'm concerned, however, the important part is that the clipboard is cleared after a while in order
to prevent mispastes, and that the kill-ring is cleared such that it doesn't get saved to disk using
##desktop## or some other session management library (see CategoryPersistence).
