erc-speedbar.el currently provides a hierarchical view of all the servers you are connected to,
and all the channels you joined. You can expand servers or channels, and expand nicknames to get user information.

== Feedback! ==

I don't use speedbar myself very often, so I'd like to receive feedback
and/or bug reports from erc-speedbar.el users on how to improve it.
