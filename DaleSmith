Hi.  I'm [::dsmith] on #emacs. I'm a fairly long time emacs user, since around version 18.something.  I've not messed with xemacs much.  Usually, I use Emacs.  You can thank me for that ntemacs sink icon.

Recently I've started using planner, very nice.  Very flexible.

There is *always* something new to learn in emacs!
