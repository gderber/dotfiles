<b>I don't like the layout of summary and article buffer, how to change it?
Perhaps even a three pane display?
</b>

You can control the windows configuration by calling the function
gnus-add-configuration. The syntax is a bit complicated but explained
very well in the EmacsManual InfoMode node "Window Layout". Some popular examples:

* Instead 25% summary 75% article buffer 35% summary and 65% article
  (the 1.0 for article means "take the remaining space"):

<pre>
(gnus-add-configuration '(article (vertical 1.0 (summary .35 point) (article 1.0))))
</pre>


* A three pane layout, Group buffer on the left, summary buffer top-right, article buffer bottom-right:

<pre>
(gnus-add-configuration
 '(article
   (horizontal 1.0
	       (vertical 25
			 (group 1.0))
	       (vertical 1.0
			 (summary 0.25 point)
			 (article 1.0)))))
(gnus-add-configuration
 '(summary
   (horizontal 1.0
	       (vertical 25
			 (group 1.0))
	       (vertical 1.0
			 (summary 1.0 point)))))

</pre>
Put the above code in your .gnus.el file.

Note that the first symbol in each configuration is a key indicating when the configuration should be applied.
See the `gnus-buffer-configuration' variable for a list of all possible window config keys.
Here are the main ones that you may want to alter:

* `group' : used when the group buffer is to be displayed (e.g. when starting gnus or quitting a Summary buffer)
* `article' : used when an article is opened
* `summary' : used when a group is opened
* `message' : used when starting to compose a new mail
* `reply' : used when replying to an article
* `forward' : used when forwarding an article
