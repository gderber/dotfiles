The `goto-address-mode' and `goto-address-prog-mode' minor modes highlight URLs and mail addresses, so that you can browse or mail them using a mouse.  They are provided by the built-in `goto-addr' package, which also provides an interactive command `goto-address' to set this up in the current buffer.
