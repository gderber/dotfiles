Emacs user for more than 4 years, since I started my !PhD thesis (in Mathematics), when I needed a good cross-platform editor. I already knew a little emacs from my Lisp-love, and vi from being the editor of choice in the first courses... It is still the editor of choice among the department staff. I pity them, poor Satan lovers.

I have small experience in editing emacs lisp (mostly to repair some minor errors I have encountered sometimes, or adding a small funcionality I like), now I am writing a major mode to interact with my fractal drawing console programs, via command line arguments. For now, it can load the image and zoom in from a "drag and drop" over that image, reload and repeat (over the same buffer, still buggy thus). But it is getting better :)

I started a 30 day challenge on 1st December 2010 in which I would use only emacs (as far as possible) to do all my standard work stuff. You can read more about this in the following posts:
