<code>info-apropos.el</code> provides an <code>M-x info-apropos</code>
for Emacs, the same as <code>M-x index-apropos</code> in the stand-alone
info reader.

<code>M-x info-apropos</code> searches for a string in the indexes of
all info documents installed on the system.  This is good for finding
references to something when you're not sure what documents might be
relevant.

The Emacs cvs head (which will be Emacs 22 or whatever) has adopted
this feature, so <code>info-apropos.el</code> is only needed for Emacs
21.
