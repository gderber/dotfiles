There are *many* different ways to find the files you want to open in Emacs. Here is a list of some of them:

= The Basics =

* FindFile -- the basic command
* FindFileAtPoint -- filename (and other things) at [[point]]
* ViewMode -- Emacs as a pager
* DiredMode -- find files by browsing directories
** use the Unix or GNU/Linux `find' command to fill a Dired [[buffer]] with file names
** WThirtyTwoFindDired
** WThirtyTwoFindDiredWithUnixUtils
* RecentFiles -- open recently used files from a menu
* BookMarks -- find bookmarked files

= Other ways =

* [[Icicles - File-Name Input]]

** open files with prefix, substring, fuzzy, or [[regexp]] match
** open recently used files
** find and open files located anywhere, even if you don't know where they are -- find by date
** find files whose names match '''''or''''' whose content matches '''''or''''' both at the same time
** match against multiple patterns ([[progressive completion]])
* InteractivelyDoThings -- open files with prefix, substring, or regexp match
* IswitchRecentFiles -- open recently used files
* LocateFilesAnywhere, GlobalFF -- find and open files located anywhere, even if you don't know where they are
* EmacsClient, GnuClient -- open files from outside of Emacs (or even inside), without starting a new, separate Emacs session
* [[Anything]] -- open anything `M-x anything-find-files', `M-x anything-find-file', or `M-x anything-for-files'
* [[Gpicker]] – quickly pick a file in project by typing just few characters of it’s name
* [[FindFileSuggest]] – create file indexes under certain directories, and navigate them using a convenient autocompletion interface
