[[ja:新規ページの命名方法]]
Use CamelCase for new pages.
Here's some help for choosing page names:

* If the name is short, such as Sql or Tcl, add "Mode" if you are
somehow describing an Emacs mode.  Therefore: <nowiki>SqlMode,
TclMode</nowiki>.
* For something as big as Gnus, you can expect a lot of sub pages.
Therefore just make it a category: <nowiki>CategoryGnus</nowiki>.
* If the page contains your configuration for a specific package, use
the suffix "Configuration", eg. <nowiki>BbdbConfiguration</nowiki>.
* If you still can't find a good name, just append "Page".  I haven't
seen this used on other wikis.  They usually use ugly capitalization
tricks such as <nowiki>UgLy</nowiki>.  Oh well.
<nowiki>TrampPage</nowiki> is nice because you can use it to say, "For
more information, see the <nowiki>TrampPage</nowiki>".

== When should links like [[This]] be used? ==

Links in double square brackets (also known as FreeLink""s) are used for the following:

# single-word pages such as [[Gnus]], acronyms such as [[BBDB]], and other non-words such as [[w3]]
# page names containing spaces in foreign languages
# page names in scripts that don't use upper and lower case pages such as [[網站地圖]]
