Eshell works fine with Viper in window systems, but on terminals, the two don't quite get along by default.
It turns out that this is due to some bad interaction between Viper's auto-indenting feature and Eshell's command line input handling.
Here's my work-around (for your .viper file):

 (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook
           (lambda ()
             (when viper-mode
               (setq viper-auto-indent nil))))

Unfortunately Viper occasionally reverts to the bad behavior despite this setting.
Toggling your Viper state to Emacs and back seems to fix this.

I'm still looking for a better work-around.
