Eight puzzle  ---  A game of eight puzzle

It is an simple game. I think the game is too easy, but when use image not just the 
letters or numbers, it may be more interesting.

You can get the source code here:

* Lisp:eight-puzzle.el

I had some [http://learn.tsinghua.edu.cn:8080/2005211356/emacs/8puzzle.zip images](dead link)
 in my homepage, and a simple perl script to split a image to nine pieces(require 
Image::Magick). Enjoy it!
