:: I use Emacs since 2009.08 to work on c/c++/java/asm code, so I write some packages for this purpose. 


=  Bellow zjl-hl.el and region-list-edit.el are updated in 2016.5.27 and have lot improvement on =

*  C++/JAVA highlight
*  The recognize rate of the local var/parameters is much much higher and thus highlighted properly. This is mostly by copying the function body to a temp buffer and do code clean so semantic can recognize the local var with much higher rate.
*  Good stability (was using this version for half year by myself)

{{{
NOTE: 
1. The faces are only optimized for white background and for black background if you have recommendation please let me know, I can merge it.
2. If you experience extreme long frozen of emacs when using both of evil (especially the dd/o/O cmd) + zjl-hl, please update your evil version. mine of 20180723 is fine and 20170624(and before) is problematic

= 1. http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/zjl-hl.el =

* This highlight C/C++JAVA file local variable/parameters, function call and some other to make code easier to read

* To install: 

**  download 
*** zjl-hl.el

*** region-list-edit.el(bellow)

*** highlight.el on ELPA or this emacswiki


**  add below into .emacs (load-file can be replaced by require if wish)

* These lines are minimum configuration needed in emacs 24.5.1
{{{
(semantic-mode 1)
(require 'semantic/bovine/c nil 'noerror)
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/myconfig/site-lisp/highlight.el") ;;OR in ELPA
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/myconfig/site-lisp/region-list-edit.el")
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/myconfig/site-lisp/zjl-hl.el")
(zjl-hl-enable-global 'c-mode)
(zjl-hl-enable-global 'c++-mode)
(zjl-hl-enable-global 'java-mode)
}}}

= 2. http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/region-list-edit.el =

* This file can add/delete a region into/from a region list, such as '((4 . 7) (11 . 15) (17 . 17) (20 . 25)) 
* zjl-hl use it to record/merge/invalid the region has been hl. Better method might be use text property or layer of orignal emacs, but I wrote the zjl-hl.el after 1 or 2 month I started use emacs, so this looks rough though, but work fine nevertheless.
