== Example ==

Write this in your html buffer:

    <!--webbot bot="Timestamp" S-Format="%Y-%m-%d" -->

This is a "bot".

Save the buffer. The result on disk is:

    <!--webbot bot="Timestamp" S-Format="%Y-%m-%d" startspan -->
    2003-09-21<!--webbot bot="Timestamp" endspan -->

Load the file again and you see your bot:

    <!--webbot bot="Timestamp" S-Format="%Y-%m-%d" -->


Thus, the "bot" always inserts the current time if you save the file.


== Compatibility ==

This feature is also known as Webbot and fully implemented by Microsoft Frontpage.

gm-webbot.el is compatible with files edited with Frontpage. That means you can edit a HTML file alternating with (X)Emacs and Frontpage without giving a up the Webbot functionality.

Naturally, you can use Emacs as your only HTML editor, too :-)


== Download ==

There are two required files:

* elisparea: Lisp:gm-webbot.el (the framework)
* elisparea: Lisp:gm-bots.el (the bot defintions)

You can download my whole Emacs customization (includes the most recent version of WebBot) via CVS:

http://www.gmdsoft.de/mitsch/emacs/index.htm

== Features ==

At the moment there are three bots available:
* "Timestamp" (you can see it above)
* "Substitution" - Substitutes variables - only for the user-name at the moment)
* "Navigation2" - makes simple "go one level up" hyperlinks for homepages; an example is my homepage: http://www.gmdsoft.de/mitsch/fun/index.htm; the hyperlink in the upper right corner).
This bot is called 'Navigation2' because MS Frontpage uses a 'Navigation' bot for more complex navigation structures.

You can add any bot you want by writing a small LISP function that must meet some conditions. You can register it with:

    (gm-bot-register-bot "YourBot" 'your-bot-func)

Here is an example for the Timestamp bot:

    (gm-bot-register-bot "Timestamp" 'gm-bot-bot-timestamp)

Details: see Lisp:gm-bots.el.

The Webbots are not bound to HTML files, only. You can specify any mode (e. g. php-mode) that should be "bot-enabled" (see: Lisp:gm-webbot.el)
