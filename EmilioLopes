Also known as [::ecl] or sometimes [::eclig].  I live near Munich, Germany.

In my free time I like to hack [[Scheme]] (also MeatBall:SchemeLanguage), play with TheOneTrueEditor (I use Emacs since 18.58) or ride my road bicycle.  I'm a member of The ChurchOfEmacs.

Some of my interests are FunctionalProgramming, ExtremeProgramming, MeatBall:ArtificialIntelligence, GnuEmacs, LispMachines, FreeSoftware, etc.  I would be happy to make contact with people sharing similar interests, specially people who live inside their Emacsen.

For an overview of my interests see my bookmarks at http://del.icio.us/eclig.  In particular you find my Emacs bookmarks at http://del.icio.us/eclig/emacs.  My [[http://del.icio.us/eclig/keyboard|keyboard bookmarks]] may be also of interest for some here.

I decided to not contribute to the current Internet flood and refrain from blogging.  Let's see how long I will keep with this :-)

You can reach me at <code>eclig</code> ''<at>'' <code>gmx.net</code>.  I speak German, English and Portuguese.
