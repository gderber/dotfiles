I've been an Emacs hacker off and on for almost 30 years (yes, I first played with it when it was in Teco).  I've never really written any Emacs Lisp (or Teco) -- I've just hacked together pieces of code that I found in various places (like the various Emacs newsgroups).  Lately, though, it seems that Emacs is changing so fast that I can't keep up with it anymore.

I've used Emacs.
I've used XEmacs.
