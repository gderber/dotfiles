This is one of the ways to change foreground and background colors.  See 
HowtoChangeFrameColors for others.

You can use <code>M-x set-foreground-color</code> and <code>M-x set-background-color</code> interactively to set the colors for the selected frame.

If you use these in your .emacs file, the colors will only be changed for the first frame.

Sample:

 (set-foreground-color "white")
 (set-background-color "blue")

Note that the colors must be strings -- and there must be a mapping from the
name to a RGB value somewhere on your system.  One of these places is typically
the /usr/X11/include/rgb.txt file.  Instead of naming the colors, you can also
use the RGB values directly:

 (set-foreground-color "#FFF")
 (set-background-color "#0000FF")

These RGB values cannot be entered interactively, because the interactive input
checks whether the names are defined.  The RGB values can have 3, 6, or 9 hex digits.

1. To enter RGB values interactively, just use `<code>M-: (set-background-color "000000FFF")</code>', or whatever.

2. To find a color interactively, try ColorPalette. You can also use the color palette to analyze color components in color models RGB and HSV or to convert between them.

3. See library '''Lisp:doremi-frm.el''' for commands to convert and tweak colors:

* `'''<code>doremi-color-name-to-RGB</code>'''' -- Return the hexadecimal RGB code for a given color name. Provides [[Completion]] based on all existing color names.

* `'''<code>doremi-increment-color-component</code>'''' -- Increment any component (red, green, blue, hue, saturation, value) of a given color. This returns another color that is redder, greener,..., or brighter than a given color by some amount.

4. See library '''Lisp:hexrgb.el''' for functions to do the following:

* convert between decimal and hex RGB values
* convert between RGB and HSV (hue, saturation, value) component values
* increment hex RGB color specs such as <code>#FFAD39C40A16</code>

5. You can set foreground and background [[Face]] color interactively by incrementing/decrementing the current color components (RGB, HSV, or CMY: cyan, magenta, yellow). You can do that using the arrow keys or mouse wheel with library '''Lisp:doremi-frm.el''', commands `doremi-face-bg-rgb' and `doremi-face-fg-rgb'. Just hold down an arrow key to continue modifying the color; stop when you get the face color you like -- WYSIWYG. See '''DoReMi'''.

6. At first <someone> misread the statement above to mean that "there must be a mapping" between a name and an RGB value in order for you to use a particular RGB value, which is incorrect: any hex RGB values can be used. The statement above is, however, correct: in order to use a given ''name'', that name must map to RGB.
