This page describes what is probably the simplest method of getting a network
printer to work with Emacs.  The method described works for a network printer
that has a network card and its own IP address.  
If you are fortunate enough to have a !PostScript printer, this method will
give you !PostScript printing without installing /GSView/ and /GhostScript/.
Essentially it boils down to three steps:-



== Install a Generic Text Printer Driver ==

Before starting, make sure that the printer you want use works properly from
a standard Windows application such as /Word/ or /Notepad/.  When you are sure
it is working properly, right-click the printer icon and select /Properties/.
Check the /Ports/ tab and make a note of the port that is being used by the
Windows printer driver.

Now use the /Add Printer/ wizard to install a Generic/Text printer driver
(the Manufacturer name is /Generic/ and the model name is
<i>Generic/Text Only</i>). Specify the port that you noted down (that is, the port
used by the full Windows printer driver).

Once the generic printer driver is installed, right-click the icon and select
/Properties/. Check the /Ports/ tab and make sure the driver is using the same
port as the full Windows driver.  Then use the /Print Test Page/ button on the
Properties/ dialog box to make sure the generic driver is working properly.
It <u>must</u> work successfully before you carry on.

== Map the Generic Printer to a DOS Device ==

Right-click the Generic printer icon, select the /Sharing/ tab and share the
printer, giving it a suitable share name.  Check that this worked by using
Emacs /shell/ or a command prompt window and entering the following command:-

: ##net view \\127.0.0.1##

Assuming the printer's sharename appears in the list, we can now map it to a DOS
device. ##LPT3:## is a good choice for this purpose. This is the command to use:-

: ##net use LPT3: \\127.0.0.1\<i>sharename</i> /persistent:yes##

The ##/persistent:yes## parameter ensures that the device will be available the
next time you log on.  Check that this worked by creating a small text file
(for example, /test.txt/) and printing it using the following DOS command:-

: ##print C:\path\to\test.txt /d:lpt3##

You <u>must</u> be able to print a text file using the ##PRINT## command before
continuing.  If the file did not print out, go through the
preceding steps again (but the most likely error is that you got the path to
the text file wrong).

== Set the Printer up in Emacs ==

Configuring the printer in Emacs is easy.  Add the following line to your
InitFile :-

: ##(setq printer-name "LPT3:")##

Emacs won't process this line until the next time you start it.  To make it work
straight away, evaluate it by placing the cursor after the closing parenthesis and typing
##C-x C-e##.

You should now be able to print from Emacs using the printer icon in the
toolbar or the /Print Buffer/ and /Print Region/ options in the /File/
menu.  If the printer is a !PostScript printer, the /Postscript Print Buffer/ and
/Postscript Print Region/ options in the /File/ menu will also work.

If the printer is not a !PostScript printer, you will have to use something
like !GhostScript and GSView to get formatted printing.  See PrintingFromEmacs
for some further information.

[new]
Unfortunately I doubt that this will work for all networked printers.
I do not remember all the cases I found where this could fail now,
but one thing I noticed is that you can not always rely on the state of the printer when
accessing it this way.
For some printers it worked and for others it did not.
That is why I wrote PrintWithWebBrowser

== Setup a printer that works over a TCP/IP port

http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/McMahanDotEmacs defines how to do this. However, I have a minor modification:

 ; if you map to the tcp/ip port, then once the printer
 ; is installed, share it from the printer properties dialog, and
 ; assign the SHARE name to 'MyPrinter' or similar

 (defconst PRINTER_NAME "MyPrinter"
   "printer to use within emacs")

 ;; now build the network printer name
 (defconst MY_PRINTER  (concat "//" (getenv "COMPUTERNAME") "/" PRINTER_NAME)
   "Point to the printer emacs is to use. Defaults to host/`PRINTER_NAME'")

 (defconst MY_PS_PRINTER MY_PRINTER
   "Point to the ps printer emacs is to use. Defaults to `MY_PRINTER'")

 (setq printer-name MY_PRINTER)


== Sending raw text to a postscript printer results in an error ==
So for me the test print using the generic driver caused a failure at the printer. The printer is expecting postscript.
