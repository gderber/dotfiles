perlnow.el is a package that fills in some of the existing gaps in emacs support for 
developers working in the [PerlLanguage perl] language:

Features of perlnow.el:

* makes heavy use of the template.el package (TemplatesMode) to speed up the initial creation of perl code 
of various sorts (scripts, proceedural modules, object-oriented modules and automated tests). 

* makes it eaisier to use the compile/next-error features of emacs by supplying default run commands 
that are more likely to be suitable for perl code.  

* re-uses these buffer-local run commands (which are also user-modifiable on the fly) when running the perl debugger. 

* encourages the creation of test files by automatically applying some naming and location conventions.

Limitations: 

perlnow.el was developed under Gnu Emacs 21.  There have been reports of difficulties with using it under xemacs.
