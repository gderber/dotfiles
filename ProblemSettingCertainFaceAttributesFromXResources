It seems that at least in GnuEmacs 21.2.1 and 21.3.1, a problem exists
where certain face-attributes, namely '':inherit'', '':overstrike'',
'':underline'' and '':strike-through'' are not correctly set up from
ResourceFiles, or X11 Resources in general.  This leads to error
messages similar to this in the MessagesBuffer

 Face woman-bold-face, frame #<frame emacs@DreamHouse.lahti 0x86e74f0\ >: invalid attribute :inherit 'bold from X resource

It is not (yet) explained here where why this happens, but if the
following lot of EmacsLisp by VivekDasmohapatra (alias [[fledermaus]])
is loaded, the attributes are set properly.  This is a candidate to be
put in ones DotEmacs.

    ;; Loading this patch will make face-attributes inherit, underline,
    ;; overline and strike-through properly be set up from X11 resources.
    ;; Values `t', `nil' and facenames must be quoted.
    ;;
    ;; code by fledermaus
    (defun set-face-attribute-from-resource (face attribute resource class frame)
      "Set FACE's ATTRIBUTE from X resource RESOURCE, class CLASS on FRAME.
    Value is the attribute value specified by the resource, or nil
    if not present.  This function displays a message if the resource
    specifies an invalid attribute."
      (let* ((face-name (face-name face))
    	 (value (internal-face-x-get-resource (concat face-name resource)
    					      class frame)))
        (when value
          (if (and (string-match "^'" value)
                   (or (eq attribute :inherit       ) 
                       (eq attribute :underline     ) 
                       (eq attribute :overline      ) 
                       (eq attribute :strike-through)))
              (progn
                (setq value (intern (substring value 1)))
                (condition-case ()
                    (internal-set-lisp-face-attribute
                     face attribute value frame)
                  (error
                   (message "Face %s, frame %s: attribute %s %S from XRDB"
                            face-name frame attribute value))))
            (setq value (downcase value))
            (condition-case ()
                (internal-set-lisp-face-attribute-from-resource
                 face attribute value frame)
              (error
               (message "Face %s, frame %s: bad attribute %s %s from X resource"
                        face-name frame attribute value)))))
        value))
    

It seems that because the basic faces ''default'', ''italic'',
''bold'' and so on are set up at startup before this patch kicks in,
they cannot be cured this way.
