I'm sorry because I assume what I'm about to ask is a very novice questions. I'm super new to emacs so please understand...
I'm really annoyed by the loud "ding" sound of the bell and I would love to change the sound to something else and also the volume of it. I see the code you provided (thank you!) but I'm too stupid/novice to know how to use the code in emacs... Where am I suppose to put the code? Please teach me... thank you!!

The traditional alternative is for Emacs to flash the screen.

# you need to edit your InitFile: ##C-x C-f ~/.emacs##
# put ##(setq visible-bell t)## at the very end
# save it: ##C-x C-s##
# restart Emacs---or evaluate the sexpr (the expression in parenthesis) just in front of point using ##C-x C-e##

Hope that helps. :)
