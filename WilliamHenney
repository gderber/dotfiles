I use Emacs. Specifically,  AquamacsEmacs on my powerbook and vanilla Emacs 22 from CVS on linux. 

More specifically, I started off with emacs 18.something back around 1990, when I first discovered Unix. For most of the intervening years I have used XEmacs but recently returned to the fold. 

==My life inside Emacs==

; Favourite major modes: AUCTeX + RefTeX

; Favourite command: query-replace-regexp

; Favourite keystroke: "M-# q"  (quick-calc) - This is much easier on a UK keyboard than a US one. 

; Favourite Emacs feature: the first line in a buffer is number 1, the first column is number 0. "Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds"--- Emerson. 

==My life outside Emacs==

I am an astrophysicist working in Mexico. I have two children. Only one has used Emacs. With the other, I figured I'd leave it until after she learns to talk.
