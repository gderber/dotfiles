= Welcome! =
Hi, I’m Giorgos Keramidas.
I use Emacs mostly on Unix-like systems, since about 1994.
Emacs and Mercurial are the first two programs I install on new systems.

You can easily reach me by email, in one of the following addresses (in order of preference):

  keramida@linux.gr
  keramida@FreeBSD.org
  keramida@ceid.upatras.gr
  gkeramidas@gmail.com

I'm also known as [::keramida] on IRC.

Welcome to the wiki! I don't obfuscate email addresses and just spend more CPU cycles [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/alex/Spam spam filtering]... -- AlexSchroeder

Thank you, Alex :)  I've unobfuscated the email addresses, since all my email is already filtered by spamassassin.
