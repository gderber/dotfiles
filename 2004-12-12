        What's in a name? that which we call a rose
        By any other name would smell as sweet;
        So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
        Retain that dear perfection which he owes
        Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
        And for that name which is no part of thee
        Take all myself.
          -- William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet,
             Act II, Scene II

An XEmacs developer asked Alex in a recent mail whether he would object
to the renaming of "Emacs" to "GNU Emacs" on the wiki when clearly
only GNU Emacs is meant, ie. to use Emacs only when something applies
to both emacsen.

One such example would be the renaming of EmacsAndXEmacs to !GNUEmacsAndXEmacs.

Also note the changes from revision 44 and 45 on EmacsAndXEmacs.

Personally I'd favor the use of "Emacs" for GNU Emacs, "XEmacs" for Emacs, and "both
Emacs and XEmacs" or "emacsen" when we're talking about both.  But I'm not too attached
so I'd just go with whoever volunteers to do the editing.  I'm also not sure how ardently
I'd follow these new guidelines, however. -- AlexSchroeder
