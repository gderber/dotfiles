The wiki community needs to provide a walk-through for a current version of Emacs, which is complicated by buff-menu.el being hard-wired into the executable during the build process such that Emacs (once built from source) no longer uses buff-menu.el -- as such, replacing buff-menu.el with an older version (which is required to use frame-bufs.el) is not possible.  The workaround is to build Emacs from source, but delete the contents of buff-menu.el prior to building.  Thereafter, it is possible to use an older version of buff-menu.el and put a provide statement at the bottom and then require it when loading Emacs.

I don't understand all that you write. But it sounds like you might have a disagreement with Emacs Dev.  If so, the first (and maybe best) place to bring that up is on ##emacs-devel@gnu.org##.
