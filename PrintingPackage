This page describes package Lisp:printing.el.gz, by ViniciusJoseLatorre.

: .:: ''v6.9.3'' :: ''part of GNU Emacs'' ::.
: .:: ''depends on PsPrintPackage v6.6.4 (or later)'' :: ''##lpr.el##'' :: ''mule'' :: ''ghostscript'' ::.

== About printing ==

With ##printing## you can preview or print a %%PostScript%% file.  You can also
print a text file using %%PostScript%%, and preview or print buffers that use
certain special modes like mh-folder-mode, rmail-summary-mode,
gnus-summary-mode, etc.  This package also includes a %%PostScript%%/text
printer database.

There are two user interfaces:

: Menu interface
:: The ##printing## menu replaces the usual print options in the menu bar.
:: This is the default user interface.

: Buffer interface
:: You can use a buffer interface instead of menus.  It looks like a
customization buffer.  Basically, it has the same options found in the
menu and some extra options, all this on a buffer.

: CUPS
:: If you are running CUPS the ##cups-bsd## system-package provides an lpr interface.

##printing## is prepared to run on GNU, Unix and NT systems.

On GNU or Unix system, ##printing## depends on ##gs## and ##gv## utilities.

On NT system, ##printing## depends on ##gstools## (##gswin32.exe## and ##gsview32.exe##).
To obtain ghostscript, ghostview and GSview see the URL
http://www.gnu.org/software/ghostscript/ghostscript.html.

##printing## depends on ##ps-print## package to generate %%PostScript%% files, to
spool and to despool %%PostScript%% buffer.  So, ##printing## provides an
interface to ##ps-print## package and it also provides some extra stuff.

To download the latest ##ps-print## package see
PsPrintPackage.
Please, see ##README## file for ##ps-print## installation instructions.

##printing## was inspired by:

: ##print-nt.el## -- Frederic Corne <_frederic_._corne_@_erli_._fr_>
:: Special printing functions for Windows NT

: ##mh-e-init.el## -- Tom Vogels <_tov_@_ece_._cmu_._edu_>
:: PS-print for mail messages

: ##win32-ps-print.el## -- Matthew O. Persico <_mpersico_@_erols_._com_>
:: %%PostScript%% printing with ghostscript

: ##ps-print-interface.el## -- Volker Franz <_volker_._franz_@_tuebingen_._mpg_._de_>
:: Graphical front end for ps-print and previewing


== Log Messages ==

The buffer ##*Printing Command Output*## is where the ##printing## log messages
are inserted.  All program called by ##printing## has a log entry in the
buffer ##*Printing Command Output*##.  A log entry has the following form:

   PROGRAM (ARG...)
   MESSAGE
   Exit status: CODE

Where
: ##PROGRAM## is the program activated by ##printing##,
: ##ARG## is an argument passed to ##PROGRAM## (it can have more than one argument),
: ##MESSAGE## is an error message returned by ##PROGRAM##
(it can have no message, if ##PROGRAM## is successful),
: and ##CODE## is a numeric exit status or a signal description string.

For example, after previewing a %%PostScript%% file, ##*Printing Command Output*##
will have the following entry:

   /usr/X11R6/bin/gv ("/home/user/example/file.ps")
   Exit status: 0

In the example above, the previewing was successful.  If during previewing,
you quit gv execution (by typing ##C-g## during Emacs session), the log entry
would be:

   /usr/X11R6/bin/gv ("/home/user/example/file.ps")
   Exit status: Quit

So, if something goes wrong, a good place to take a look is the buffer
##*Printing Command Output*##.  Don't forget to see also the buffer ##*Messages*##,
it can help.


== Novices (First Users) ==

First of all, see printing documentation only to get an idea of what
##printing## is capable.

Then try to set the variables: ##pr-ps-name##, ##pr-ps-printer-alist##,
##pr-txt-name##, ##pr-txt-printer-alist## and ##pr-path-alist##.  These variables
are the main variables for printing processing.

Now, please, see these variables documentation deeper.  You can do this by
typing ##C-h v pr-ps-name RET## (for example) if you already loaded printing
package, or by browsing ##printing.el## source file.

If the documentation isn't clear or if you find a way to improve the
documentation, please, send an email to maintainer.  All ##printing## users
will thank you.

One way to set variables is by calling ##pr-customize##, customize all
variables and save the customization by future sessions (see Options
section).  Other way is by coding your settings on Emacs init file (that is,
##~/.emacs## file), see below for a first setting template that it should be
inserted on your ##~/.emacs## file (or ##c:/_emacs##, if you're using Windows 9x/NT
or MS-DOS):

; **NOTE 1** : Don't forget to download and install ghostscript utilities (see Utilities section).

; **NOTE 2** : The ##printer-name## and ##ps-printer-name## variables don't need to be
set, as they are implicit set by ##pr-ps-printer-alist## and ##pr-txt-printer-alist##.

; **NOTE 3** : The duplex feature will only work on %%PostScript%% printers that
support this feature.

: You can check if your %%PostScript%% printer supports duplex feature
by checking the printer manual.  Or you can try these steps:

:: 1. Open a buffer (or use the ##*scratch*## buffer).
:: 2. Type:

::: ##First line (on first page)##
::: ##^L##
::: ##Second line (on second page)##

:: 3. Print this buffer with duplex turned on.

: If it's printed 2 (two) sheets of paper, then your %%PostScript%%
printer doesn't have duplex feature; otherwise, it's ok, your
printer does have duplex feature.

; **NOTE 4**: See Tips section.


== Tips ==

[new]
; **Tip 1.** : If you have a local printer, that is, a printer which is connected
directly to your computer, don't forget to connect the printer to your
computer before printing.
[new]

; **Tip 2.** : If you try to print a file and it seems that the file was printed, but
there is no paper in the printer, then try to set ##pr-delete-temp-file##
to nil.  Probably ##printing## is deleting the temporary file before your
local system can get it to send to the printer.

[new]
; **Tip 3.** : Don't try to print a dynamic buffer, that is, a buffer which is
modifying while ##printing## tries to print.  Eventually you got an error
message.  Instead, save the dynamic buffer to a file or copy it in
another buffer and, then, print the file or the new static buffer.
An example of dynamic buffer is the ##*Messages*## buffer.
[new]

; **Tip 4.** : When running Emacs on Windows (with or without cygwin), check if your printer is a text printer or not by typing in a DOS window:

      print /D:\\host\printer somefile.txt

: Where, ##host## is the machine where the printer is directly connected,
##printer## is the printer name and ##somefile.txt## is a text file.

: If the printer ##\\host\printer## doesn't print the content of
##somefile.txt## or, instead, it returns the following message:

      PostScript Error Handler
      Offending Command = CCC
      Stack =

: Where ##CCC## is whatever is at the beginning of the text to be printed.

: Therefore, the printer ##\\host\printer## is not a text printer, but a
%%PostScript%% printer.  So, please, don't include this printer in
##pr-txt-printer-alist## (which see).

[new]
; **Tip 5.** : You can use gsprint instead of ghostscript to print monochrome %%PostScript%%
files in Windows.  The gsprint utility documentation says that it is more
efficient than ghostscript to print monochrome %%PostScript%%.

: To print non-monochrome %%PostScript%% file, the efficiency of ghostscript
is similar to gsprint.

: Also the gsprint utility comes together with gsview distribution.

: For more information about gsprint see http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/gsprint.htm.

: As an example of gsprint declaration:

      (setq pr-ps-printer-alist
            '((A "gsprint" ("-all" "-twoup") "-printer " "my-b/w-printer-name")
              (B "gsprint" ("-all" "-twoup") nil "-printer my-b/w-printer-name")
              ;; some other printer declaration
              ))

: The example above declares that printer A prints all pages (-all) and two
pages per sheet (-twoup).  The printer B declaration does the same as the
printer A declaration, the only difference is the printer name selection.

: There are other command line options like:

:: ##-mono##    Render in monochrome as 1bit/pixel (only black and white).
:: ##-grey##    Render in greyscale as 8bits/pixel.
:: ##-color##   Render in color as 24bits/pixel.

: The default is ##-mono##.  So, printer ##A## and ##B## in the example above are
using implicitly the ##-mono## option.  Note that in ##-mono## no gray tone
or color is printed, this includes the zebra stripes, that is, in ##-mono##
the zebra stripes are not printed.

: See also documentation for ##pr-ps-printer-alist##.

== Using printing ==

To use ##printing## insert in your ##~/.emacs## file (or ##c:/_emacs##, if you're
using Windows 9x/NT or MS-DOS):

   (require 'printing)
   ;; ...some user settings...
   (pr-update-menus t)

During ##pr-update-menus## evaluation:

: On Emacs 20
:: it replaces the ##Tools/Print## menu by ##Tools/Printing## menu.
: On Emacs 21
:: it replaces the ##File/Print*## menu entries by ##File/Print## menu.

Please, see section Menu Layout below for menu explanation.

To use ##printing## utilities you can use the ##Printing##
menu options, type ##M-x##
followed by one of the commands below, or type a key associated with the
command you want (if there is a key binding).

##printing## has the following commands:

   pr-ps-name
   pr-txt-name
   pr-ps-utility
   pr-show-ps-setup

   pr-show-lpr-setup

The general meanings of above commands are:

: //PREFIX//:
:: ##pr-interface##
::: buffer interface for printing package.
:: ##pr-help##
::: help for printing package.
:: ##pr-ps-name##
::: interactively select a %%PostScript%% printer.
:: ##pr-txt-name##
::: interactively select a text printer.
:: ##pr-ps-utility##
::: interactively select a %%PostScript%% utility.
:: ##pr-show-*-setup##
::: show current settings.
:: ##pr-ps-*##
::: deal with %%PostScript%% code generation.
:: ##pr-txt-*##
::: deal with text generation.
:: ##pr-toggle-*##
::: toggle on/off some boolean variable.
:: ##pr-despool-*##
::: despool the %%PostScript%% spooling buffer.
:: ##pr-printify-*##
::: replace nonprintable ASCII by printable ASCII representation.

: //SUFFIX//:
:: ##*-customize##
::: customization.
:: ##*-preview##
::: preview a %%PostScript%% file.
:: ##*-using-ghostscript##
::: use ghostscript to print.
:: ##*-fast-fire##
::: fast fire command (see it for documentation).
:: ##*-print##
::: send %%PostScript%% directly to printer.
:: ##*-ps-print##
::: send %%PostScript%% directly to printer or use
ghostscript to print.  It depends on ##pr-print-using-ghostscript## option.

: //INFIX/SUFFIX//:
:: ##*-directory*##
::: process a directory.
:: ##*-buffer*##
::: process a buffer.
:: ##*-region*##
::: process a region.
:: ##*-mode*##
::: process a major mode (see explanation below).
:: ##*-file-*##
::: process a %%PostScript%% file.
:: ##*-file-up-*##
::: process a %%PostScript%% file using a filter utility.

Here are some examples:

; ##pr-ps-buffer-using-ghostscript## : Use ghostscript to print a buffer.

; ##pr-ps-file-print## : Print a %%PostScript%% file.

; ##pr-toggle-spool## : Toggle spooling buffer.

So you can preview through ghostview, use ghostscript to print (if you don't
have a %%PostScript%% printer) or send directly to printer a %%PostScript%% code
generated by ##ps-print## package.

Besides operating one buffer or region each time, you also can postpone
previewing or printing by saving the %%PostScript%% code generated in a
temporary Emacs buffer.  This way you can save banner pages between
successive printing.  You can toggle on/off spooling by invoking
##pr-toggle-spool## interactively or through menu bar.

If you type, for example:

   C-u M-x pr-ps-buffer-print RET

The ##pr-ps-buffer-print## command prompts you for a n-up printing number and
a file name, and save the %%PostScript%% code generated to the file name instead
of sending to printer.

This behavior is similar with the commands that deal with %%PostScript%% code
generation, that is, with ##pr-ps-*## and ##pr-despool-*## commands.  If
spooling is on, only ##pr-despool-*## commands prompt for a file name and save
the %%PostScript%% code spooled in this file.

Besides the behavior described above, the ##*-directory*## commands also
prompt for a directory and a file name regexp.  So, it's possible to process
all or certain files on a directory at once (see also documentation for
##pr-list-directory##).

##printing## has also a special way to handle some major mode through
##*-mode*## commands.  So it's possible to customize a major mode printing,
it's only needed to declare the customization in ##pr-mode-alist## (see
section Options) and invoke some of ##*-mode*## commands.  An example for
major mode usage is when you're using ##gnus## (or ##mh##, or ##rmail##, etc.) and
you're in the ##*Summary*## buffer, if you forget to switch to the ##*Article*##
buffer before printing, you'll get a nicely formatted list of article
subjects shows up at the printer.  With major mode printing you don't need
to switch from ##gnus## ##*Summary*## buffer first.

Current global keyboard mapping for GNU Emacs is:

   (global-set-key [print]     'pr-ps-fast-fire)
   (global-set-key [M-print]   'pr-ps-mode-using-ghostscript)
   (global-set-key [S-print]   'pr-ps-mode-using-ghostscript)
   (global-set-key [C-print]   'pr-txt-fast-fire)
   (global-set-key [C-M-print] 'pr-txt-fast-fire)

And for XEmacs is:

   (global-set-key 'f22                'pr-ps-fast-fire)
   (global-set-key '(meta f22)         'pr-ps-mode-using-ghostscript)
   (global-set-key '(shift f22)        'pr-ps-mode-using-ghostscript)
   (global-set-key '(control f22)      'pr-txt-fast-fire)
   (global-set-key '(control meta f22) 'pr-txt-fast-fire)

As a suggestion of global keyboard mapping for some ##printing## commands:

   (global-set-key "\C-ci"  'pr-interface)
   (global-set-key "\C-cbp" 'pr-ps-buffer-print)
   (global-set-key "\C-cbx" 'pr-ps-buffer-preview)
   (global-set-key "\C-cbb" 'pr-ps-buffer-using-ghostscript)
   (global-set-key "\C-crp" 'pr-ps-region-print)
   (global-set-key "\C-crx" 'pr-ps-region-preview)
   (global-set-key "\C-crr" 'pr-ps-region-using-ghostscript)

# and then customize ##printing## options.

Through this way, you may choose if the settings are kept or not when you leave out the current Emacs session.


== Menu Layout ==

The ##printing## menu (Tools/Printing or File/Print) has the following layout:

See ##pr-visible-entry-list## for hiding some parts of the menu.

The menu has the following sections:

//A. Interface//:

: **0.** You can use a buffer interface instead of menus.  It looks like the
customization buffer.  Basically, it has the same options found in the
menu and some extra options, all this on a buffer.

<i>I. %%PostScript%% printing</i>:

: **1.** You can generate a %%PostScript%% file (if you type ##C-u## before activating
menu) or %%PostScript%% temporary file for a directory, a buffer, a region
or a major mode, choosing 1-up, 2-up, 4-up or any other n-up printing;
after file generation, ghostview is activated using the file generated
as argument.  This option is disabled if spooling is on (option **16**).
Also, if you already have a %%PostScript%% file you can preview it.
Instead of previewing each buffer, region or major mode at once, you
can save temporarily the %%PostScript%% code generated in a buffer and
preview it later.  The option ##Despool...## despools the %%PostScript%%
spooling buffer in a temporary file and uses ghostview to preview it.
If you type ##C-u## before choosing this option, the %%PostScript%% code
generated is saved in a file instead of saving in a temporary file.
To spool the %%PostScript%% code generated you need to turn on the option
**16**.  The option ##Despool...## is enabled if spooling is on (option
**16**).

:: //NOTE 1//:
::: It's possible to customize a major mode printing, just declare
the customization in ##pr-mode-alist## and invoke some of
##*-mode*## commands or select ##Mode## option in ##Printing## menu.  An
example for major mode usage is when you're using ##gnus## (or ##mh##,
or ##rmail##, etc.) and you're in the ##*Summary*## buffer, if you
forget to switch to the ##*Article*## buffer before printing,
you'll get a nicely formatted list of article subjects shows
up at the printer.  With major mode printing you don't need to
switch from ##gnus## ##*Summary*## buffer first.

:: //NOTE 2//:
::: There are the following options for %%PostScript%% file processing:

:::: **Ia.** Print the file ##*No Preprocessing*##, that is, send it directly to %%PostScript%% printer.
:::: **Ib.** %%PostScript%% utility processing selection.
See ##pr-ps-utility-alist## and ##pr-setting-database## for
documentation.
:::: **Ic.** Do n-up processing before printing.
:::: **Id.** Toggle on/off landscape for %%PostScript%% file processing.
:::: **Ie.** Toggle on/off duplex for %%PostScript%% file processing.
:::: **If.** Toggle on/off tumble for %%PostScript%% file processing.

:: //NOTE 3//:
::: Don't forget to download and install the utilities declared on ##pr-ps-utility-alist##.

: **2.** Operate the same way as option **1**, but it sends directly the %%PostScript%%
code (or put in a file, if you've typed ##C-u##) or it uses ghostscript to
print the %%PostScript%% file generated.  It depends on option **18**, if it's
turned on, it uses ghostscript; otherwise, it sends directly to
printer.  If spooling is on (option **16**), the %%PostScript%% code is saved
temporarily in a buffer instead of printing it or saving it in a file.
Also, if you already have a %%PostScript%% file you can print it.  Instead
of printing each buffer, region or major mode at once, you can save
temporarily the %%PostScript%% code generated in a buffer and print it
later.  The option ##Despool...## despools the %%PostScript%% spooling
buffer directly on a printer.  If you type ##C-u## before choosing this
option, the %%PostScript%% code generated is saved in a file instead of
sending to printer.  To spool the %%PostScript%% code generated you need
to turn on the option **16**.  This option is enabled if spooling is on
(option **16**).  See also the //NOTE 1//, //NOTE 2// and //NOTE 3// on option **1**.

: **3.** You can select a new %%PostScript%% printer to send %%PostScript%% code
generated.  For selection it's used all %%PostScript%% printers defined
in ##pr-ps-printer-alist## variable (see it for documentation).
See also ##pr-setting-database##.

//II. Text printing//:

: **4.** If you have control characters (character code from ##\000## to ##\037##) in a
buffer and you want to print them in a text printer, select this
option.  All control characters in your buffer or region will be
replaced by a printable representation.  The printable representations
use ##^## (for ASCII control characters) or hex.  The characters ##tab##,
##linefeed##, ##space##, ##return## and ##formfeed## are not affected.  You don't need
to select this option if you use any option of section I, the
%%PostScript%% engine treats control characters properly.

: **5.** If you want to print a directory, buffer, region or major mode in a
text printer, select this option.  See also the //NOTE 1// on option **1**.

: **6.** You can select a new text printer to send text generated.  For
selection it's used all text printers defined in
##pr-txt-printer-alist## variable (see it for documentation).
See also ##pr-setting-database##.

<i>III. %%PostScript%% page toggle options</i>:

: **7.** If you want a %%PostScript%% landscape printing, turn on this option.

: **8.** If you want to have a header in each page in your %%PostScript%% code,
turn on this option.

: **9.** If you want to draw a gaudy frame around the header, turn on this
option.  This option is enabled if print header is on (option **8**).

: **10.** If you want that the line number is printed in your %%PostScript%% code,
turn on this option.

: **11.** If you want background zebra stripes in your %%PostScript%% code, turn on
this option.

: **12.** If you want a duplex printing and your %%PostScript%% printer has this
feature, turn on this option.

: **13.** If you turned on duplex printing, you can choose if you want to have
a printing suitable for binding on the left or right (tumble off), or
to have a printing suitable for binding at top or bottom (tumble on).
This option is enabled if duplex is on (option **12**).

: **14.** If you want a %%PostScript%% upside-down printing, turn on this option.

: **15.** With this option, you can choose if you want to print all pages, odd
pages, even pages, odd sheets or even sheets.
See also ##ps-even-or-odd-pages##.

<i>IV. %%PostScript%% processing toggle options</i>:

: **16.** If you want to spool the %%PostScript%% code generated, turn on this
option.  To spool the %%PostScript%% code generated use option **2**.  You
can despool later by choosing option **1** or **2**, sub-option ##Despool...##.

: **17.** If you use colors in your buffers and want to see these colors on
your %%PostScript%% code generated, turn on this option.  If you have a
black/white %%PostScript%% printer, these colors are displayed in gray
scale by %%PostScript%% printer interpreter.

: **18.** If you don't have a %%PostScript%% printer to send %%PostScript%% files, turn
on this option.  When this option is on, the ghostscript is used to
print %%PostScript%% files.  In GNU or Unix system, if ghostscript is set
as a %%PostScript%% filter, you don't need to turn on this option.

//V. Printing customization//:

: **19.** If you want that region is automagically detected, turn on this
option.  Note that this will only work if you're using transient mark
mode.  When this option is on, the ##*-buffer*## commands will behave
like ##*-region*## commands, that is, ##*-buffer*## commands will print
only the region marked instead of all buffer.

: **20.** Turn this option on if you want that when current major-mode is
declared in ##pr-mode-alist##, the ##*-buffer*## and ##*-region*## commands
behave like ##*-mode*## commands.

: **21.** If you want that Printing menu stays open while you are setting
toggle options, turn on this option.  The variables
##pr-menu-char-height## and ##pr-menu-char-width## are used to guess the
menu position, so don't forget to adjust these variables if menu
position is not ok.

//VI. Customization//:

: **22.** Besides all options in section III, IV and V, you can customize much
more %%PostScript%% options in ##ps-print## option.  Or you can customize
some ##lpr## options for text printing.  Or customize ##printing##
options.

: **23.** Show current settings for ##printing##, ##ps-print## or ##lpr##.

: **24.** Quick help for printing menu layout.

How can I specify a printer (e.g. %%PostScript%%) using its IP address (URL)? For example, if all I know it that the printer is at ##foo.my.company.com##, how do I specify that in `pr-txt-printer-alist' and `pr-ps-printer-alist'? I'm using MS Windows, but the network printer in question is not a Windows share (i.e. not of the form ##\\printers\pname##). -- DrewAdams

[new:ViniciusJoseLatorre:2009-07-24 01:09 UTC]
: First of all, I think the printer must be added to your TCP/IP printer in your Windows.
: Maybe the following link can help you to do this:
: http://www-jerry.oit.duke.edu/community/howto/pc/add_tcpip_printer.html
: Hmm, after the steps above you'll have a ''local printer pointing'' to your ##TCP/IP:port## printer.
: Maybe it'll be better to do a test in a DOS prompt window:
:: ##copy file LPT1 /B##
: or
:: ##print /D:LPT1 file##
: **Note:** in the example above ##LPT1## should be a ''free'' driver __before__ the association with the ##TCP/IP:port## printer.
: If it's all right, just change your PrintingPackage setting, probably adding one more entry for this new printer.
: -- ViniciusJoseLatorre
: ''**PS:** I'm not a MS Windows user, so, maybe some extra steps should be done. Can someone else help?'' :-)


[new:DrewAdams:2009-08-03 01:45 UTC]
Thanks, but I tried that, as I mentioned by email.

LPT1 is not free, however; it is assigned to a real local printer. I have several such "IP" printers that I need to be able to print to. I have no problem using them in any other application, besides Emacs.

Seems like there should be a way to do as in other apps. Both of these would be welcome:

* Call up (from Emacs) the Windows printer selection dialog box, and then use whatever printer you choose that way.

* Print using the default printer (default for Windows).

I've been using Emacs and ##printing.el## fine for years to print to shared network printers (e.g. ##\\foo\bar\...##). But now my company is replacing all of those with printers configured using just an IP address, as I described. I hope some solution becomes available. Otherwise, I'll end up printing listings with %%TextPad%% or something. ;-) -- Thx, DrewAdams

Isn't it clear from the discussions that Eli and I have had on Emacs Devel that printing on MS Windows is broken?
It happens to work sometimes but there is absolutely no guarantee.
That is why I wrote the routines to print through the web browser.
(They are part of [NxhtmlMode nXhtml].)

Or, you can use ghostscript, see http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PrintingFromEmacs.

-- LennartBorgman

[new:DrewAdams:2009-08-03 04:18 UTC]
Lennart, I don't want to get into a polemic about this. I think you're changing the subject, at least in part, if not a great deal. ##printing.el## and ##ps-print## work fine, for me at least. Let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater.

I do not want this discussion to be diverted to something off-track and more general. I sinned I guess by raising a more general question, but I'll retract it from this discussion, since I don't want to lose track of the immediate issue.

My immediate need is simply to be able to register an IP printer with ##printing.el##. There might be a way to do it, or perhaps that could be added if it doesn't yet exist.

Beyond that, it's true that I asked the question whether Emacs couldn't move toward working with the normal MS Windows print dialogs: (a) let you choose a printer using the standard dialog (outside Emacs) and have Emacs use that choice, and (b) be able to use the default printer, as set up in Windows in the usual way (outside Emacs).

Those two concerns I raised, my immediate request and my question about a possible major new feature, do not, I think, have much, if anything, to do with your arguments that Emacs "printing is broken" on Windows. But I admit that I didn't follow that thread much, so I might be mistaken that you have changed the subject completely. 

In any case, I would like to curb the subject here to my immediate need, which is to be able to use ##printing.el## and ##ps-print## with an IP printer. As to any more general discussion, including the question I raised about using the normal Windows printer interface, we should take that elsewhere -- e.g. to ##emacs-devel@gnu.org##. Thanks. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Ok, but my comments has nothing to do with ##printing.el## etc.
It is about the ability to send data to the printer, setting the printer mode etc.
Good luck.

: Hi Drew,
: Maybe there is another solution.
: Could you try to use the package Lisp:ipp.el ?
: This package allows to use printer located as ##ipp://some.host.ip:port/##.
: Please, let me know the results.
: -- ViniciusJoseLatorre
: ''**PS:** If it works, I'll have to modify PrintingPackage.''

[new:DrewAdams:2009-08-05 06:47 UTC]
Thanks, Vinicius, but I couldn't figure out how to use it, or get it to work. I tried various formats, including the one you mention. Nada.  I tried telnetting to the printer using port 631 and also using the port it is configured with. Nada. I tried to email EricMarsden to ask for some more info, but the email bounced. Basically, I don't really know what I'm doing. ;-) -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2009-08-05 15:25 UTC]
My bad: actually, something was printed, but not correctly. I'll follow up with you by email, Vinicius. Thanks for your help. -- DrewAdams
