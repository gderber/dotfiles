== Original code ==

<code>perldoc.el</code> by SteveKemp looks up [PerlLanguage Perl] function documentation within Emacs, using Perl's [http://perldoc.perl.org/perldoc.html perldoc program].

The package was posted to the <code>gnu-emacs-sources</code> list (<code>gnu.emacs.sources</code> newsgroup, see EmacsMailingLists and EmacsNewsgroups) in 2001 and can be found in the archives.

: Groups:perldoc.el

== Debian version ==

On a [[Debian]] system it can be found in DebianPackage:emacs-goodies-el, and the version there includes a few enhancements:

* generate the list of functions dynamically

Since 30.4-1, Debian ships the perldoc.el version that is available from intrigeri's Git repository:

<code>
git clone git://gaffer.ptitcanardnoir.org/lunar-mode-line.git
</code>

... with a few more features:

* ability to have several uniquely-named perldoc buffers open at the same time
* completion for Perl modules names

* CPerlMode -- has its own separate <code>M-x cperl-perldoc</code> doing a similar thing
