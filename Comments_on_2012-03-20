Nice move to add the link to show the wiki in Wikipedia style :)

Meh, "Talk" pages.  I say we just ignore the troll baiting and keep the old CSS and the inline discussion.  These two changes aren't going to fix the issues with the material on the site anyway.

Not so sure about that.
IIRC the idea of the comment in the page was that someone will see the mess and delete the comments and refactor the page.
In practice I don't think it has worked. See http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=browse;diff=2;id=Magit for instance, the guy just put a question out of the blue in the middle of the page and after 2 months nobody answered, nobody removed the questions.

How do you navigate between a site and it's discussion (apart from adding "Comments_on" to the URL by hand)? Ah, I see it on the bottom. Should this be a bit more obvious?

shjk, I can make it more obvious if you can suggest a particular change you'd like to see. My web design-fu is weak...

AlexSchroeder: here is an attempt. It's put just below the page title in the hope that's a location which will not be missed. I created a little CSS/Html mess, though. It might be a good idea to ask someone with better knowledge of this stuff than me to implement this properly :)

[[image:LinkToTalkPageSuggestionImage]]

The article itself would get a "To Discussion" link.

Added to wiki.css:

    .article_talk_nav {
        font-size: 40%;
        line-height: 30%;
        letter-spacing: 0;
    }

    div.article_talk_nav a:link {
        color:#00F;
        text-decoration: underline;
    }
    div.article_talk_nav a:visited {
        color:#A0A;
        text-decoration: underline;
    }
    div.article_talk_nav a:active {
        color:#F00;
        text-decoration: underline;
    }


Added to page html:

  <div class="article_talk_nav">
    <br><a title="To Article" href="article">To Article</a>
  </div>

This is added into the page title like this (formatting changed):
    <br><span class="specialdays">Bangladesh, Independence Day</span>
    
    <h1>
      <a title="Click to search for references to this page" rel="nofollow"
         href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=004774160799092323420:6-ff2s0o6yi&amp;q=%22Comments%20on%202012-03-20%22">
        Comments on 2012-03-20
      </a>
      <div class="article_talk_nav">
        <br><a title="To Article" href="article">To Article</a>
      </div>
    </h1>
    </div>

Hm, below the title. Interesting… Ideally, this would work without modification of the HTML source, though. Otherwise all the other CSS files (including the ’Pedia theme) would get messed up. Sometimes it is possibly to do this using absolute positioning. This necessarily requires the header to not have line-breaks (which introduces usability issues for people with narrow screens). Here's a first attempt at achieving it:

* [EmacsWiki:action=browse;id=Comments_on_2012-03-20;css=/css/talkative-emacs.css;theme= use Talkative Emacs theme]

* [EmacsWiki:action=browse;id=Comments_on_2012-03-20;css=;theme= back to the default theme]

* [http://www.emacswiki.org/css/talkative-emacs.css CSS source]

Depending on how this looks on narrow screens, perhaps we should force a linebreak in front of the search box.

I'm not sure what to think.

Glad to see that EmacsWiki is moving forward. :-)

The problem is we don't have enough Emacs users contributing.  People seem more interested in spinning a yarn on their personal blogs.

FWIW, I generally agree with AaronHawley's first comment, about ##Talk##.  I will probably not use ##Talk## often (dunno) --- but I don't mind it existing.

I do however wish that the ##Talk## link were moved a bit.  It takes the place (former position) of the ##Edit this page## link, which I use a lot.  Call it finger memory, but it was easier to just pick the ##Edit this page## link as the leftmost link in the last line of links on the page.  (Yes, just a nit.)

While I'm on the subject, I'll repeat an old request that the ##Edit this page## link be moved or copied to the page ''header'', to obviate needing to scroll the page down to get to it.

And on an editing page, I'd like to see the ##Save## and ##Preview## buttons copied to the page top, for the same reason: to obviate needing to scroll.

I think this is doable. The 'pedia theme would be a good starting point since it moves the Edit link to the top:

* [EmacsWiki:action=browse;id=Comments_on_2012-03-20;css=/css/pedia.css;theme=top#switch use Wikipedia Top theme]

* [EmacsWiki:action=browse;id=Comments_on_2012-03-20;css=;theme=#switch back to the default theme]

AlexSchroeder: I've been using your new CSS for a few days now and I like it a lot. Would the line breaking issue be fixed by putting the talk/article link on top of the page title?

-- shjk 2012-03-29 01:15 UTC


----

Wrt moving Edit link to the top: I do not want to change from the default display (CSS, presumably) to something else.  Why would the Edit link location need to depend on which CSS you choose?

-- DrewAdams 2012-03-29 02:06 UTC

How about the *Talkative* theme up above, then?
