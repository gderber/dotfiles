Hi DrewAdams

well I want to Emacs to start up clean (without loading any desktop file) and then select the project which I like working on using your Bookmark+ extension.

Therefore, I need ‘desktop-save-mode’ to 'nil'. That means desktops do not get saved, no matter if I load any with Bookmark+. The variable ‘desktop-save’ (which is set to ‘ask-if-new‘ in my configuration) will be ignored also.

That means if I'd like to save the latest state of my desktop (before switching to another desktop file using Bookmark+ or closing emacs) I need to do that manually. This is the reason for those funtions. 

> Also, I would think that ‘kill-emacs-hook’ would be what you want, not ‘before-save-hook’.

upps...yeah that was the wrong hook :) thanks

OK, thanks for the info.  Let's both think about it some more. -- DrewAdams

What do you mean with that? Think about what?

If you want, I will think about possible enhancement to the existing Bookmark+ code, to, for example, (optionally) save a current desktop before switching, etc.  I don't have time to look at this more right now, but I will keep it in mind.  And it is of course good if you provide your code as a separate library as well.

OK sounds good.

I added some information to the file and changed the first function so that it doesn't start with bmkp prefix. The second one overwrites your bookmark+ function and therefore needs to have the same name. 

For a whole library that seems a little bit too small for me.
