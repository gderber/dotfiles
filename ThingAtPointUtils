Deliver a set of functions to return, mover over or  manipulate a given THING. 

THING may be a well known form as word, paragraph, but also a char class as  `alnum' or a new defined thing.

For example `ar-alnum-atpt' will return  alpha-numerical chars below and around cursor as a
 string. 
`ar-bounds-of-alnum-atpt' returns the  borders of that string as a list and so on.


Some example key-settings

 (global-set-key [(super \()] 'ar-parentize-region-atpt)

 (global-set-key [(super \/)] 'ar-slash-region-atpt)

 (global-set-key [(super \<)] 'ar-lesser-angle-region-atpt)

 (global-set-key [(super \>)] 'ar-greater-angle-region-atpt)

 (global-set-key [(super \[)] 'ar-bracket-region-atpt)

 (global-set-key [(super \\)] 'ar-backslash-region-atpt)

 (global-set-key [(super \{)] 'ar-brace-region-atpt)


Beside of <super>, the key already tells what to pick.
 Quite often used are commands like this:

 (global-set-key [(control c)(\")] 'ar-doublequote-or-copy-atpt)

 (global-set-key [(control c)(\')] 'ar-singlequote-or-copy-atpt)

A whole bunch of commands are available:

 ar-THING-atpt

 ar-THING-bounds-atpt

 ar-THING-beginning-position-atpt

 ar-THING-end-position-atpt

 ar-THING-beginning-atpt

 ar-THING-end-atpt

 ar-THING-length-atpt

 ar-THING-copy-atpt

 ar-THING-kill-atpt

 ar-THING-forward-atpt

 ar-THING-backward-atpt

 ar-THING-transpose-atpt

 ar-THING-sort-atpt

 ar-THING-check-atpt


Also a couple of commands, whose use is much less probable:

 ar-THING-slash-atpt

 ar-THING-double-backslash-atpt

 ar-THING-doubleslash-atpt

 ar-THING-delete-in-region

...

and several hundreds more
