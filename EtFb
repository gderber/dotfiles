== EtFb, aka Eric the Fruitbat ==

(/real name Paul Sleigh, but that's much less widely used - and what is "real" anyway?/)

Relatively new to Emacs, but familiar with LISP and Scheme.  Tried XEmacs a while back but never got hooked; turned again to Emacs when existing text editors became too insanely frustrating to bear.  Why Gnu Emacs instead of XEmacs?  I have no idea; I guess because RMS is a much sexier man than JWZ, even if he doesn't have [http://www.dnalounge.com/ his own nightclub].

Other geekish interests include programming languages ([http://www.turbopower.com/ Delphi], Pascal, Prolog, [http://www.dpawson.co.uk/index.html XSLT], Forth, [http://store.yahoo.com/paulgraham/articles.html LISP], Scheme, [http://www.ros.co.nz/pdf/user.php PHP], [http://www.perladvent.org/2004/ Perl], [http://www.viceteam.org/ PET/CBM Basic], 80x86 Assembler, and many more), Palm programming ([http://groups.yahoo.com/group/plua/ Plua], [http://ppcompiler.free.fr/forum.php?lng=en&cat=5 PP], [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/onboardc/ OnboardC], [http://www.quartus.net/products/forth/ Quartus Forth], and of course [http://www.lispme.de/index.html#lispme/index.html LispMe]), [http://www.sca.org/heraldry SCA heraldry], and web standards.

Welcome to the wiki.  We're not religious about using real names on this wiki.  It does feel weird to talk to a fruitbat, though.  ;)  Notice how we handle IRC nicks, however: We use our "real" name on the wiki, and declare the nick as permanent anchor.  Then following a link to the nick will lead you to the "real" page. -- AlexSchroeder aka. [[kensanata]]
