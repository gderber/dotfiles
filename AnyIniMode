<b>Keyword highlighting for .ini files etc based on a 'source of truth'</b>

* Highlighting of valid section & param names
* Define numerous styles of file
* Each style can define its own valid section & param names
* Fully customizable

Get any-ini-mode.el here: Lisp:any-ini-mode.el.

=== Quick overview: ===

An .ini file is this context is any file that has a structure of
parameter settings, possibly broken into sections.

eg.

    [USER]
    editor = vi
    group = supers
    home = ~/home

    [BACKUP]
    path = ~/home/backup
    always = TRUE

or maybe ...

    NAME : user1
    GROUP : supers
    BACKUP : LOCAL

    <BACKUP>
    PATH : ~/home/backup
    ALWAYS : TRUE

If you often edit particular types of these files and you would like
to use intelligent keyword (section and param name) highlighting, then
any-ini-mode is (IMHO) the answer.

To enable highlighting of the valid keywords in a particular type of
file (say myapp.conf), you centrally store a 'canonical' file for the
type (containing all the valid section and param names) and set up an
any-ini 'style' that uses the canonical file.

Now name the style for the relevant filename (myapp.conf), and that's it.

When any myapp.conf file is opened in future, the correct style will
be automatically applied and the valid keywords highlighted.
