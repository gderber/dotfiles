[::valexiev]
Used Emacs extensively in my academic years (since 1992, XEmacs since about 1994).
Now in corporate life I can't use emacs nearly as often as I'd like. 
But in Oct-Nov 2010 I've rediscovered the emacs religion is hugely reinvigorated, and I'm excited to start using it again intensively. OrgMode and EmacsWiki are GREAT!
