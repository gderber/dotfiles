These are ways to repeat interactive commands or shorten the number of keys it takes to accomplish things.  These features make one more efficient, but also can avoid disabilities like [[RSI]].

* UniversalArgument - Provide an argument to any command, often to repeat it.
* RepeatLastCommand - Emacs can display the previous command in Emacs Lisp and prompt you to re-execute it. 
* KeyboardMacros - Encapsulate a number of keyboard sequences into a macro and repeat it. 
* RepeatKeyDifferentBehaviors -- Repeating the same key and getting different behaviors, in a cycle.
* DoReMi -- Run commands repetitively or iteratively, using the arrow keys or the mouse wheel to repeat or iterate.
* [https://github.com/willghatch/emacs-repeatable-motion repeatable-motion] -- Repeat motion commands forward and backward.
* RepeatingCommandsLikeVi - If you long for the "." command.
* [[Repeatable]] -- Repeat commands bound to complex key sequences by only pressing the last key again.


* RepetitionDetection - (Marginally related - let Emacs tell you when you're repeating yourself.)
