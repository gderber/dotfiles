A personal information manager (PIM) collects facts you accumulate during
your daily life:  Names of friends and business partners, their phone
numbers, their addresses, maybe their mails, your meetings with them,
the other things you have planned, the ideas you have had while travelling
on the train, and many other things.

A lot of software tries to help you manage the information flood;
some of them use Emacs.  See CategoryPersonalInformationManager.
