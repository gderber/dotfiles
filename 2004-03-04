Kenichi Handa announced the creation of an emacs-bidi branch in CVS today!
He says:

: I've just made a branch "emacs-bidi" and commited several
changes including Eli's bidi code so that people other than
I can start working on it.

: But, although I can compile the code and start up Emacs,
when I set the buffer local variable enable-bidi-display,
Emacs crashes.

Help is needed!  :)
