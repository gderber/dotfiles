I'm actually a vim user, but I'm interested in Emacs because of its ability to support many different human languages at once.  Its a capability that I would like to put to good use in the near future for an application that facilitates the translation of documents in a collaborative, wiki-like manner.

I'm very thankful for the existence of www.emacswiki.org, because I think it will be of great help to me in my project.

Peace and Blessings

Hello and welcome!  Thanks for the kind words; indeed I was fascinated with the ability to write Japanese on NT Emacs back when Emacs 20 came out. -- AlexSchroeder
