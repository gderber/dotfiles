JonathanArkell has taken that version, and added some things like:
* buffer local tag indicators
* tagcloud display
* ECB integration
* GPL Licence (thanks Drew)
* new and Improved name to distinguish from Conrads version (thanks Drew!)

And plans to do more with it.  As with the rest of his elisp, feel free to jump in and help with things!
