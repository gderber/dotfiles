Should I switch to Google for searching?
communitywiki.org does it:
[http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Acommunitywiki.org+emacs Search communitywiki.org for emacs].
I'm not sure this would actually improve search usefulness on this site.
Right now we're using Search::!FreeText with neither tokenizing, stop lists, nor stemming because I figured it would never work
on a multilingual site.

* +1 on google search of site - TerrenceBrannon

* Maybe we could just choose between the two. A cookie could be used to store the preferred default. -- PeterBarabas

* +1 for another way to search (google yahoo or whatever), I seem to have difficulties to find anything with the current search method -- PierreGaston

* +1 to let someone else do the search. I changed my !QuickSearch to use google a while ago. -- AlokSingh

Implementing the preference sounds like more work. Also, do you find the current search to be of any use whatsoever? Why would you want to offer it? Personally, I dont think anyone would want to keep it. -- TerrenceBrannon

Ok, I didn't know that nobody likes the original search. :-) -- PeterBarabas

Well, we could try Google for a while. I don't think I want to offer the current search as an option. I'm with Jef Raskin on this one: If we offer options, then that's because our design is not perfect.

Ok. We're now using a Google Custom Search Engine. Let me know how it goes.

I no longer index this site myself. This means that
A link like ##http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?search=fnord## will invoke the old regular expression based search. The old=1 add-on should not be required.

In order to save some cycles, I did away with something I rarely use: The page title is no longer a search for the pagename. Let me know if you want it back and we'll find a way to link it to Google.

Let's use it for a day or two before we actually update the documentation on this site.

Apparently I can send out invitations to "search engine contributors" -- whatever that means. If you're interested, drop me aline.

Oh,  this is sweet. I did a search for my contribution and only highly relevant results came back:
http://www.google.com/cse?cx=004774160799092323420%3A6-ff2s0o6yi&q=shell-current-directory&sa=Search

I love it! Toss in another +1 for TerrenceBrannon

Looks good so far. Thanks. -- DrewAdams

It is indeed a marked improvement. How does this 'search contribution' work ? -- AlokSingh

[new]
No idea. :D Maybe this is where you can add keywords and stuff to influence the search results or add URLs and URL patterns to the pool searched. -- AlexSchroeder

**2007-11-22**: Titles link to searches again, and do so via Google.

Wunderbar. Thx -- DrewAdams

**2007-11-22**: Custom search is not the solution.
It is the wiki titles that are the culprit. For example, try this search: http://tinyurl.com/yoa6so - while I expected www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/ChangeFontsPermanentlyOnWindows

Previously I argued about this problem in #emacs, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/17646/

What about putting it in HTML headers as meta keywords?
Do you suggest a stop-list containing common prefixes like "Mc" and "Mac"?
This will only work for letters A-Z, because the wiki is encoding agnostic and knows nothing of UTF-8...
-- AlexSchroeder

[new]
Maybe put something under the wiki name header, something like

  (Change Fonts Permanently On Windows.)

[new]
Well, I implemented it for the title element. Basically I'm doing the following:

    s/([[:lower:]])([[:upper:]])/$1 $2/g

We'll see the result in a few weeks, I guess.
