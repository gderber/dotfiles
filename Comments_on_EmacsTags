I tried running the “find-file-upwards” code to find the TAGS file (evaluating the definition first, then the whole nested “let” function), and I got an error message saying “Symbol's function definition is void: labels”.

It was missing (require 'cl), but anyway that function is just duplicating the builtin locate-dominating-file, so I replaced it.
