On Microsoft Windows, files are typically associated with applications according to their file extension. There are various ways to exploit this functionality in Emacs, to open ##*.doc## files in Word, URLs in a Web browser, and so on.



* GnuEmacs has built-in function ##w32-shell-execute##.  [[XEmacs]]'s equivalent is ##mswindows-shell-execute##. Both allow files to be opened in various ways; see the corresponding Info manual for details.

[:w32-browser]
* Library <tt>[[w32-browser.el]]</tt> defines command `w32-browser', which calls an MS Windows application, passing it a string argument such as a file name.
##w32-browser.el## also defines command `w32explore', which opens Windows Explorer to a file or folder; it selects the file in Explorer.

* Library <tt>[[w32browser-dlgopen.el]]</tt> combines ##w32-browser.el## with ##dlgopen.el##, a library by BinuJosePhilip. It opens the Windows *Open Files* dialog box, then applies `w32-browser' to the files you select. 

* Library '''[[DiredPlus|Dired+]]''' uses ##w32-browser.el## and defines similar commands that are bound to keys and menu items in [[Dired]]. They act on either the current file or folder or the one under the mouse. See [[DiredPlus#w32-browser|Dired+: w32-browser]].

* Library '''[[BookmarkPlus|Bookmark+]]''' lets you open bookmarks using their Windows file associations. It does this by calling `w32-browser'. And library '''Dired+''' lets you create bookmarks for each of the marked files in a Dired buffer, without your needing to visit them in Emacs. Combined with the ability to tag bookmarks a la [[http://delicious.com|del.icio.us]], these features let you easily organize and open non-text files such as music and images.

* EmacsMacro has file ##e-w32.el## where functionality similar to `w32-browser' is implemented like this: -- HorstDuchene

<pre>
        (defun dired-custom-execute-file (&optional arg)
          (interactive "P")
          (mapcar #'(lambda (file)
		      (w32-shell-execute "open" (convert-standard-filename file)))
	          (dired-get-marked-files nil arg)))

        (defun dired-custom-dired-mode-hook ()
          (define-key dired-mode-map "X" 'dired-custom-execute-file))
        (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'dired-custom-dired-mode-hook))
</pre>


* With SexMode on any command to open a file that is specified in OrgMode to be open by windows shell will be opened that way.
