I just found this page and I don't understand this wiki thing completely, but I think it's OK to advertise my web page here.  Bang me if I'm misbehaving.

Hi and welcome.  Most people link to their "real" homepage from the
name page on this wiki.  Your link is perfectly fine, as long as other
don't feel that you are <i>only</i> interested in advertising your
homepage.  ^_^  -- AlexSchroeder
