Majority of automated spam attempts can be avoided by having some kind of verification string in the HTML page, generated for that single HTML page, and verified upon receipt of form data.

If pages are generated by Wiki, program can have hidden field with date or some other key, and form acceptance would recognize it is not from website, but from a page.

Spammers are not that smart to request one page, parse the key, and request other page. 

I am implementing it as SSI and it should not take long time to do it in a Wiki.

Yeah, that takes care of most automated spam. We do get the occasional manual spam, though.
