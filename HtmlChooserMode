From the commentary:

Provides a dummy major mode called html-chooser-mode that
looks at a file, and if it seems to be XHTML, switches to
nxml-mode, and if it seems to be regular HTML, switches to
html-mode (or html-helper-mode, or whatever).  If the file is empty
or otherwise cannot be understood, the user is prompted to choose
which mode, and is offered the possibility of inserting several 
skeletons or templates appropriate to that mode.
