Having to convert an old MoinMoin wiki to MediaWiki, I found precious
little that actually worked to make the conversion.  So, a page at a
time, I did the conversion.  Then I saw how the patterns were going, and
cut and pasted the text into Emacs, and built a function to automate
it.  Then I decided that it would take forever to move over 600 pages,
so I automated the entire process.

To use this, just find the base name of your MoinMoin Wiki and the base
name of your new MediaWiki installations, and feed them to mm2mw-wiki.
Tested only on Emacs 22, requires at least a url library with the
ability to do HTTP POSTs.  Check the *Messages* buffer to see how it
did, per page.

My MoinMoin wiki was v1.2.x, so I have absolutely no idea if it will
work on later versions.  This might give somebody a good start, though.
I don't claim that it supports everything; it definitely does not handle
attachments correctly.  There are probably better ways to do everything
but I built this in a couple of days from scratch for my own purposes,
and if God is good to me I will not have to do it again.

I ripped the wikiname regexp from OddmuseMode and the UrlPackage HTTP
POST code from an example on EmacsWiki; beyond that I wrote this on my
own.

See Lisp:mm2mw.el if you want to try it out.  I probably can't help you
if you have problems, but if you can handle Emacs it might be a good
place to start.
