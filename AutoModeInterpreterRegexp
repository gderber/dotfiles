The [::auto-mode-interpreter-regexp] is a variable used by SetAutoMode that determines the MajorMode based on the first line of the file.

For example, if this is the first line of the file:

  #!/bin/bash

Then the file is as determined to have an associated interpreter, in this case it is the Bourne again shell, [[Bash]], located at ##/bin/bash##.

Emacs then uses the variable `interpreter-mode-alist' to use the assocations of interpreters ("##python##", "##awk##", "##guile##", "##sh##") to modes (`python-mode', `awk-mode', `scheme-mode', `sh-mode').
