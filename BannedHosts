# A lot of innocent people can be banned if entire networks are being
# banned.  Sometimes this is the only solution since the banned person
# is using a dynamic IP and hostname assigned by the ISP.
# Generally, we prefer to use BannedContent to fight link spam.
# Banning hosts and IP numbers is for vandals and leeches.
# If you got banned because you leeched the site (downloaded all the
# pages), please get the page database instead.  See
