Download: Lisp:email.el

=== Commentary ===

This package permits easy archiving of outgoing mails, sending CCs to a specified set of people automatically and add a reference id to the subject of the mail, all based on the mail headers only.  A set of three associative-lists is used to determine the behaviour.  Its a complement of vm-auto-folder-alist (used to archive incoming messages).

=== Configuration ===

Put email.el in your load-path and add the following line to the .emacs file:

 (require 'email)
 (setq send-mail-function 'email-send)

Now configure the alists (<code>email-fcc-alist</code>, <code>email-cc-alist</code> and <code>email-id-alist</code>). Note that email.el is designed for the MailMode, but it should work with other Modes, too.
