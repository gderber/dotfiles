Cycle-Buffer package:

  ;; Keywords: switch-to-buffer, cycle buffer list

Get it from the author's [https://github.com/VladimirAlexiev/emacs elisp repository] or Lisp:cycle-buffer.el.

For alternatives ways to cycle buffers, see '''[[SwitchingBuffers#BufferCycling]]'''.

I have been using the cycle-buffer package for a few years now and for the way that I normally work it is better than any of the alternatives I have tried. Fast! You press a key and you immediately see the next buffer in the current frame, no waiting for confirmation.

You also see the neighboring buffers of the current buffer listed in the message line, which helps you to orient yourself within the list. ([[ControlTABbufferCycling#BufferStack]] can do this too, and is better at keeping your currently active buffers near the top.)

I bind two keys for cycling:

    (global-set-key [f11] 'cycle-buffer-backward)
    (global-set-key [f12] 'cycle-buffer)

This makes it easy to back up when I overshoot (as I often do) because the cycling is so fast.

For dealing with buffer clutter I also bind the shifted versions of those keys as follows:

    (global-set-key [S-f11] (lambda () (interactive) (kill-buffer nil)))
    (global-set-key [S-f12] 'bury-buffer)

For general principles of key bindings and other tips see CategoryKeys.
