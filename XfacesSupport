Newer emacsen support X-Face headers (see GnusXFace and [[XFace]]) and the newer
Gnus versions support Face headers (see GnusFace and [[XFace]]), as do newer
[[MH-E]] versions.

== Emacs 20 ==

Emacs 20 cannot do X-Faces (as used in Newsreaders, for example -- see GnusXFace).
Debian has a package to do this:  They convert the X-face into a
StippleAttribute and use that instead.  The same trick is used in the
Gnus splash screen.

Anyway, if you are interested in the lisp files, check here:

* http://packages.debian.org/bitmap-mule

Note that XEmacs and Emacs 21 seem not to need this.  See CompFace for
more on creating X-Faces, and BbdbFaces for more on storing them in
the Big Brother Database.
