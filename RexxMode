[[es:ModoRexx]]
Rexx-mode is a major mode for editing Rexx files under Emacs. Originally written by [[AndersLindgren|Anders Lindgren]] years ago, it hasn't been touched since. Then James Perrin started to write rexx (actually ARexx on Amiga) with Emacs19 and he decided to add font-lock support. This led him to take over the rexx-mode maintainance from Anders and even he built a homepage for it.  Perrin discontinued its support and the page disappeared, resting a copy in the Web Archive. It can now be found in the EmacsAttic on: [https://github.com/emacsattic/rexx-mode GitHub].
