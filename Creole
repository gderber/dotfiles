A markup language agreed by [[http://www.wikicreole.org/|committee]].

Also a [[http://github.com/nicferrier/elwikicreole|tranformer]], written in Elisp, for converting Creole text to HTML and intermediary forms.

Creole markup is very close to the [[Oddmuse]] markup language. Because of this Aidalgol and NicFerrier selected it for use as the base of [[Elwiki]], the new EmacsWiki Wiki engine, written in EmacsLisp.

NicFerrier's Creole program is being altered so that it can do [[Oddmuse]] specific rendering. We plan to add a compliance table here of all [[Oddmuse]] syntax that Creole can, or cannot do.

== Other things ==

See the [[http://github.com/nicferrier/elwikicreole|Creole project]] README for details on what Creole can do.

Particular highlights are:

* embedded Lisp in Creole pages 
** for example so you can add directory listings to creole pages
* OrgMode tables
** which can have formulas attached which Creole will re-calculate
* a transform API with many stages
** including an s-expression representation stage so Creole pages can be turned into JSON
