== Type Ahead Support for Emacs-w3m ==

Type ahead support for Emacs-w3m.  See the code Lisp:w3m-type-ahead.el.

This allows an isearch facility that is limited to <code>HREF</code> anchors.
Switch the mode on for all <code>w3m-mode</code> buffers with:

    (add-hook 'w3m-mode-hook 'w3m-type-ahead-mode)
