There are several calculators for Emacs out there.  Here is a selection of modes for you to use if you need some calculations.

* PlainLispForMath describes how to write and evaluate simple
  arithmetic lisp expressions.  This requires you to use lisp prefix
  notation.  Example: (+ 1 3) ==> 4
* The SimpleCalculator is a little pocket calculator featuring various
  trigonometric functions, binary/octal/hexadecimal modes for input
  &amp; display, etc.  Expressions are entered using normal infix
  notation, parens are used as normal.  Example: (1 + 3) ==> 4
* There is also a SimpleRpnCalculator available.
* AdvancedDeskCalculator is a very powerful package featuring RPN,
  arbitrary precision (floating point), complex numbers, error forms, vectors,
  matrices, dates, times, an interface to gnuplot, and symbolic
  calculus.  Also known as GNU Calc.
