User of Emacs, mainly in nox mode with Tmux as a companion. 

I'm a Perl novice, so I like cperl-mode and flymake-perlcritic. Doing Java for a living.

It's interesting to say that Emacs was the stuff that give me the wish of learn what is free software and make me install my first GNU/Linux distribution in 2006 to escape from the AppleÂ© rules. As Emacs was shipped with OS-X (in it's nox form), I typed "emacs" and say : what the **** is that ?

Seven years laters, Emacs is my favorite application.
