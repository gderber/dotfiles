Context sensitive help is help that matches the current context, for example the current [[major mode]] and the symbol at [[point]].

(If you're interested in a one-liner for the symbol at point, take a look at ElDoc.)


== Mouse-3 Contextual Menu ==

Library [[Mouse3]] (<tt>[[mouse3.el]]</tt>) gives you a context-specific popup menu by clicking the right mouse button (`mouse-3') twice (slower than a double-click).

The menu differs depending on whether the [[region]] is active.  If it is then you get a menu of actions on the region.  Otherwise you get a menu of actions on a thing at point. Actions can be anything; in particular, they can include contextual help information.

By default, each of these menus also includes, at the beginning of the menu, a submenu
that has, as its own submenus, the global menus that are currently available.

You can also provide mode-specific behavior by either replacing the
default `mouse-3' popup menu or augmenting it with mode-specific entries.



== Emacs Lisp ==

Emacs has two key bindings programmers are very familiar with:

* `C-h f' gives you the documentation for the function at point
* `C-h v' gives you the documentation for the variable at point

== Perl ==

CPerl mode comes with the function `cperl-perldoc' that calls `perldoc' on the symbol at point.
Here's a simple addition to your config file to make `C-h f' call it, even if you use ordinary
Perl mode instead of CPerl mode.

{{{
(add-hook 'perl-mode-hook 'my-context-help-for-perl-mode)

(defun my-context-help-for-perl-mode ()
  (require 'cperl-mode);; for help
  (local-set-key (kbd "C-h f") 'cperl-perldoc))
}}}

== Python ==

Python mode has support for ElDoc, and a key binding to go along with it: `C-c f`.
If that doesn't do what you expect it to do, give the following code a try.

{{{
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    (local-set-key (kbd "C-h f") 'pydoc-at-point)))

(defun pydoc-at-point ()
  "Run `pydoc' on the word around point."
  (interactive)
  (pydoc (python-eldoc--get-symbol-at-point)))

(defun pydoc (word)
  "Run `pydoc' on WORD."
  (interactive
   (list (let* ((default-entry (python-eldoc--get-symbol-at-point))
                (input (read-string
                        (format "pydoc entry%s: "
                                (if (string= default-entry "")
                                    ""
                                  (format " (default %s)" default-entry))))))
           (if (string= input "")
               (if (string= default-entry "")
                   (error "No pydoc args given")
                 default-entry)
             input))))
  (require 'man)
  (let* ((case-fold-search nil)
	 (Man-switches nil)
	 (manual-program "pydoc"))
    (Man-getpage-in-background word)))
}}}

== Go ==

Go has commonly used helper programs `godoc' and `godef' which can be used to find documentation
and source definitions.

An example of how to enable `C-h f' as context sensitive help function:

{{{
;; https://github.com/dominikh/go-mode.el
(use-package go-mode
  :config
  :bind (:map go-mode-map
	      ("C-h f" . godoc-at-point)))
}}}
