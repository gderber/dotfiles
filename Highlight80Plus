*Note: This package is no longer maintained* because Emacs 23 has this feature integrated into WhitespaceMode.
Add `lines' or `lines-tail' to variable `whitespace-style' and customize `whitespace-line-column'. -- [[nschum]]

This mode highlights all characters that cross the 80 character line limit.  It is available at at http://nschum.de/src/emacs/highlight-80+/.

The WhitespaceMode of Emacs does a very similar thing, but not exactly the same.  It highlights the ''entire'' line, when the line is longer than `whitespace-line-column'.  It would also be nice if we could configure Emacs to show an overlay at column 80, like the one shown at:

To get a overlay marker at column 80 check out FillColumnIndicator.
