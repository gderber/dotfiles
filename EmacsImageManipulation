== Emacs Image Manipulation Package ==

This package allows interactive image manipulation from within Emacs.
See the code Lisp:eimp.el.

It uses the mogrify utility from ImageMagick to do the
actual transformations.

Switch the minor mode on programmatically with:

    (eimp-mode 1)

or toggle interactively with <code>M-x eimp-mode RET</code>.

Switch the minor mode on for all image-mode buffers with:

    (autoload 'eimp-mode "eimp" "Emacs Image Manipulation Package." t)
    (add-hook 'image-mode-hook 'eimp-mode)

== Questions ==

: ''Question: is it possible to save an eimp-edited image, and if so, how?'' - [[pft]]

: ''Answer: The eimp-edited image can be saved with C-xC-s.''

: ''Question: I cannot save eimp-edited result. What was saved is the original image. - [[DoveYoung]]

: ''Non-answer: Well, it worked for me.  I tried it again:  I just resized and image in eimp, saved it, and then the on-disk image was also resized.  I'm using GNU/Linux, could it be an operating system issue?''

: ''Question'': Is there a way to make eimp always use the original image for resizing, so the quality does not decrease with multiple scale operations? - [[ArneBab]]
