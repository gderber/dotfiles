This is the page TOC linking to all EmacsWiki pages about HowmMode and
its extensions.

The main goal for this category page to exist is to provide as much
material as possible about this marvelous *but* unfairly overlooked
mode. HowmMode is certainly one of the most capable note taking tool
available for Emacs but very few documented (or to be precise:
documentation is not accessible to non-japanese people).

I hope people will share their knowledge on these pages.

* HowmMode -- this is the main page
* HowmAndCalendar -- integrate regular CalendarMode into your HowmMode workflow.
