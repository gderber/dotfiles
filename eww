'''Emacs Web Wowser''' ('''[::EWW]''') is a Web browser written in elisp and based on shr.el.  It is included in Emacs 24.4 and later.  It supports some basic CSS and HTML5.

== Windows ==

Make sure that libxml2 and GnuTLS are installed and that the executables and DLLs can be found by EMACS. You may add their location to <code>%PATH%</code>. The aforementioned packages are provided by [http://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/ ezwinports] or [https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-25-i686-deps.zip Emacs (25, 32-bit)] (same [https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-25-x86_64-deps.zip for 64 bit]).

You may also need to install TLS certificates, as explained in Magnus’ article [http://xn--9dbdkw.se/diary/how_to_enable_GnuTLS_for_Emacs_24_on_Windows/index.en.html “how to enable GnuTLS for Emacs 24 on Windows”].
