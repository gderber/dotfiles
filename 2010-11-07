Hi all! Unfortunately I seem to have broken the config file a few hours ago without realizing it.
It took an email by StefanKamphausen and DrewAdams to alert me to the fact.
Thanks for the heads up, and sorry for the raw wiki experience -- no goto-bar, no CSS, nothing.

We're back!

Thanks! I was busy examining my browsers .conkerorrc for some missing/corrupted js spec goofing the CSS (and silently wondering if I was loosing my mind faster than I even I myself had assumed...) --[[mon_key]]

Thanks for your quick action, Alex. We're certainly spoiled on %%EmacsWiki%% by the consistent quality of the software and your prompt help. The indadvertent changes earlier today would have made a good April-fool's joke, though. ;-) -- DrewAdams

Hehe. Yeah, it reminded me of [http://naked.dustindiaz.com/ CSS Naked Day]. :) -- Alex
