== Emacs and SVG ==

The SVG patch for emacs was accepted 20070822. This means SVG images can now be displayed with emacs! You need to have librsvg2-devel installed, and it needs work before it can be used 
on other plattforms than X. Type C-c C-c to view an svg file as an image or add (auto-image-file-mode 1) to your .emacs. 


I think Emacs and SVG is a very good match!

For instance:
* edit SVGfiles directly with nxml mode and view them instantly within emacs
* generate svg with elisp and display

I have 2 applications in particular in mind:
* mindmaps with PlannerMode and SVG
** Did you notice FreeMind?
* beautify uml diagrams generated with COGRE (ConnectedGraphEditor)

== Editing SVGs ==
To get auto completion and validation of SVGs using NxmlMode, install the schema from NxmlModeSchemas.

it would also be neat to integrate Inkscape and emacs, particularily with EmacsXembed patches

== Emacs, Inkscape and DBus ==
There is a DBus enabled branch of Inkscape on Launchpad.

Emacs has a neat DBus facility.

Heres demo integration code:

{{{
(defun  inskcape-test ()
  (let*
    ((desktop (dbus-call-method
               :session "org.inkscape" "/org/inkscape/application"
               "org.inkscape.application" "desktop_new"))
     (rect (dbus-call-method
               :session "org.inkscape" desktop
               "org.inkscape.document" "rectangle" :int32 100 :int32  100 :int32  100 :int32  100))
           )))

}}}
