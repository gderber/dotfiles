==Using pdfTeX in Emacs `tex-mode'==

To use pdfTeX in TeXMode (`tex-mode'), set the `tex-command' variable by putting the following in your <tt>.emacs</tt> file

  (setq tex-command "pdftex")

To use a PDF-capable viewer with the `tex-view' command, you must override the definition for the `tex-view' function, by using:

  (defun tex-view ()
    (interactive)
    (tex-send-command "xpdf" (tex-append tex-print-file ".pdf")))

where /xpdf/ is the name of the PDF-capable viewing command.

Simply, using <code>(setq tex-dvi-view-command "xpdf")</code> is /not/ a solution.
