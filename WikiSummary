 wiki-sum.el --- Write a summary of the wiki

The WikiSummary of a page is the first paragraph on the page with at least two sentences.  It's a simple trick, but it seems to work for my pages.  [http://www.geocities.com/kensanata/elisp/wiki-sum.el.txt Download]

WikiSummary can be used together with WikiMode.  Personally, I use it for two things:

* I call M-x wiki-write-summary from time to time to generate the <nowiki>SiteSummary</nowiki> page for me.
* I generate meta description tags for my pages.  This is more elaborate.

''Generating Meta Desciption Tags''

Creating the meta description must happen when the page is published.  It happens in two stages.  First, we determine the summary of the current page using the function `my-wiki-store-summary' as a markup rule.  It doesn't add any markup: It just stores the page summary in the variable `my-wiki-summary'.  Later, we use the function `my-wiki-add-summary' to insert the summary in the header.

    (load-library "wiki-sum")
    (defvar my-wiki-summary nil)
    (defun my-wiki-store-summary ()
      (if (member (file-name-nondirectory buffer-file-name)
                  wiki-summary-exclude-pages)
          (setq my-wiki-summary nil)
        (setq my-wiki-summary (wiki-summarize))
        (when my-wiki-summary
          (while (string-match "\"" my-wiki-summary)
            (setq my-wiki-summary (replace-match "&quot;" t t my-wiki-summary))))))
    (defun my-wiki-add-summary ()
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (when (and my-wiki-summary
                 (search-forward "</title>" nil t))
        (insert "\n"
                "<meta name=\"description\" content=\""
                my-wiki-summary "\">")))

Now we need to install these two functions in `wiki-pub-rules'.  See
SampleWikiModeSetup for an example.

To see how it works, take a look at the source of this page.  You
should see the meta description tag right after the </title> tag.
