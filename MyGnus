*This used to be a website for Gnus users. It no longer exists.*

The URL used to be http://my.gnus.org/ and the motto was "To boldly frobnicate what no newbie has grokked before."

You can try the #gnus channel on Freenode, if you want to talk about Gnus on InternetRelayChat.

== Where are the FAQs ==

It seems that this website hosted formerly the Gnus frequently asked questions (see [[GnusQuestions]]).
The FAQs are now part of the Gnus distribution and you can read them in the info page: use <code>C-h i m gnus RET</code> to get there.
You can also find them in [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/gnus/Frequently-Asked-Questions.html their section at the Gnus manual].
The FAQs are in the file gnus-faq.texi from the Emacs git repository; see it here: [http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/doc/misc/gnus-faq.texi]
