SimonMichael likes EmacsWikiMode and WikiRemote very much. Here are some notes
on setup, problems, ideas etc.

System details: emacs on debian GNU/linux sid, specifically
* emacs21-21.1-7
* emacs-wiki-2.29-2
* w3-url-e21.2001.11.08-2
* w3-el-e21-4.0pre.2001.10.27-6
* xemacs21-basesupport-el-2001.12.16-1, etc

'''EmacsWikiMode (emacs-wiki.el)'''
* I want ~ to be my main wiki directory since I already keep a lot of wiki-ish notes there.
* I want wikiname completion, C-c C-f and publishing to ignore the non-wikinamed files there. Haven't quite managed this yet. Published pages are only for local browsing right now.
* Customizations: (I'm just pasting these from .emacs, you'll probably use &quot;M-x customize-group RET emacs-wiki&quot;) :
 '(emacs-wiki-directories (quote (&quot;~&quot;)) nil (emacs-wiki))
 '(emacs-wiki-file-ignore-regexp &quot;\`\(\.?#.*\|.*,v\|.*~\|\.\.?\|\..*\)\'&quot;)
 '(emacs-wiki-private-pages (quote (&quot;[^A-Z].*&quot;)))
 '(emacs-wiki-use-mode-flags nil)

* I'm tweaking for closer support of zwiki-style wikinames, interwiki links etc. This isn't working yet:
 '(emacs-wiki-name-regexp
   &quot;\(\[\[\([^] ]+\)\]\(\[\([^] ]+\)\]\)?\]\|
    \&lt;[A-Z][A-Za-z]*\([A-Z][a-z]+\)+[0-9]*\([#:][A-Za-z0-9_%]+\)?\)&quot;)
* Use FrontPage instead of WelcomePage:
 '(emacs-wiki-default-page &quot;FrontPage&quot;)
 '(emacs-wiki-home-page &quot;FrontPage&quot;)
: I like the sound of these bells and whistles. C-c ! a to create a footnote.  highlight-changes-mode shows your changes since the last save in red. I may add the cool flyspell-mode later, but it's also red and it's getting confusing.
 '(emacs-wiki-mode-hook (quote (emacs-wiki-use-font-lock footnote-mode highlight-changes-mode)))
* Use konqueror not netscape for opening non-wiki urls:
 '(emacs-wiki-browse-url-function (quote browse-url-kde))

'''WikiRemote (wiki-remote.el)'''
* My url package is a newer version with asynchronous url-retrieve function.
* Tried converting wiki-remote.el to call url-retrieve-synchronously
** This hangs after fetching the page for reasons I don't understand.
** My xemacs installation has the older url which will probably work fine.
* Can I load those files in emacs? Yes.
** I unzipped /usr/share/xemacs21/packages/lisp/w3/*.el.gz into ~/emacs/w3-old
** (copy default.css as well so w3 will work)
** byte-compiled the lot (dired, mark all, B)
** Loaded wiki-remote like this:
   (setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name &quot;~/emacs/w3-old&quot;) load-path))
   (load &quot;url&quot;)
   (load &quot;wiki-remote&quot;)
** It now worked fine for http://zwiki.org/TestPage but hung on this page.
** Commented out the (&quot;&quot; . &quot;&quot;)  in the usemod-get-data function to get usemod wikis working.  Now we're rockin'!
** Ack no link to wiki rules on edit form - sacrilege!

----------------------------------------
'''Some ideas/projects'''

 [&quot;source mode&quot; - in emacs, font-lock turned off;
  &quot;edit mode&quot; - in emacs, font-lock on;
  &quot;browse mode&quot; - in browser, viewing .html version]
* edit mode: allow : for interwiki links (something like WikiInter?)
* allow other zwiki wikinames
* support nested lists
* edit mode: highlight headings
* edit mode: open interwiki links with wiki-remote if possible 
* edit mode: more highlighting and entry support for emacs-wiki markup rules
* edit mode: highlighting/entry support for other markup rules (zwiki structuredtext, usemod, classic wiki...)
* wiki-remote: provide same highlighting/entry support as emacs-wiki-mode
* wiki-remote: buffer modified indicator
* zwiki: support emacs-wiki markup rules
