I try to be a helpful EmacsChannel citizen.  Some may know me there as p00ya.  If you meet me, greet me as Dean, unless you know how to pronounce zeros.

You can see what I'm working on by reading my [http://scarff.id.au/ software-related blog].

I'm appreciative of the open source software that I (almost exclusively) use everyday.  To name a few, I'm a happy user of:
* GNU Emacs (duh!)
* Debian GNU/Linux
* Mac OS X
* perl

I have enough elisp knowledge to read the stuff, but barely enough to write it.

I'm a recently-graduated software consultant, and sometimes-idler (what else does one do on #emacs?).
