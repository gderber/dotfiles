Discussion of the bootstrap config…

----

On my iPhone, I noticed that the footer is too narrow and the header takes up too much space (three lines).

Using Firefox on my Mac, the checkbox seems to be misaligned with the label.

Sharp.  Nice work Alex and Evgkeni!

Just one user --- I disabled it.

Too wide, for one thing, and text truncated at browser edge instead of wrapped.  Plus changing the text size in the brower has no effect (so less accessible in this respect also).  Not to mention ochre/orange text on off-white background; a non-serif font that makes many uppercase and lowercase letters practically indistinguishable,...

'''Generally less readable than the old default.'''  The ''default'' should be as accessible as possible, IMHO.  Those wanting something (that they find) more asthetically pleasing can opt ''in'' for that.

Here's what I see in my browser (IE7, and it's similar in Google Chrome --- images scaled to 75% here).  Even ignoring the problems with the top of the page, there is a lot more information visible in the actual text area of the old compared to the new.

==== New style: ====
[[image:newwikistyle]]

==== Old style: ====
[[image:oldwikistyle]]

The current design does not seem to properly support zooming in Chromium browser which makes the site totally unusuable for me.

-- Jmnoz 2013-04-24 16:11 UTC


----

I disagree with the above statement, that "the default should be as accessible as possible". A fancy default with a simple fallback can be very reasonable. But, in all honesty, the css could use some work:

The body is very wide which makes it annoying to read, some simple fixes are:

{{{
.wrapper,.span12 {
    max-width: 960px;
  }
  @media (max-width:480px){
      h1 { font-size: 1.8em; }
      .footer .legal {
          margin: 70px 5px 5px !important;
      }
  }
}}}

This could just be added to bootstrap.css. Bootstrap also has some nice code to make a small collapsable menu on smaller screens.

Thanks for the work, looking forward to version 2.0.1.

Using lots of "grey contrast" does make a site look more stylish if you're not actually spending much time reading it, but the decreased contrast also decreases readability for many of us (especially if you no longer have the eyesight of a teenager).  The styling of comments here now is a particularly bad example, now being dark grey against light grey, forcing me to squint to read them.  Please choose solid contrasts, rather than shades of grey, it tends to give me a headache. Thanks.

Perhaps add some simple borders for tables.

{{{
table.user {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    box-shadow: 0 0 1em #eee;
}
table.user tbody tr td {
    padding: 0.1em 0.25em;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
}}}

-- AaronHawley 2013-04-24 19:01 UTC


----

Concerning John's squinting:

The default text is dark (#333) on gray (#eee) a difference of #bbb (3003).

Comments are gray text (#888) on white (#fff) a difference of #777 (1911).  If it was changed to #444, it would be the same contrast.

-- AaronHawley 2013-04-24 19:44 UTC


----

Thank you all for your feedback and the CSS suggestions.

I added [http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/base-css.html#tables bootstrap default table style] to all tables. Examples: [Self:action=history;id=Comments_on_2013-04-24 page history], [[Reference Sheet by Aaron Hawley]].

I made some changes to the footer for iPhones "@media (max-width:480px)" and hid the CC logo, made the legal blurb wider, etc. I also fiddled with the header a bit in order to make it waste less space.

I also made the "comments" when you use ##[new]## on a page darker. Examples: [[2013-03-19]], EmacsWikiProblems.

-- AlexSchroeder 2013-04-25 09:49 UTC

FWIW, I agree with Johnw , I like the modern look but IMHO contrast is not good.

Twitter Bootstrap is a very nice starter for websites. [http://bootswatch.com/spacelab/ Bootswatch] has some good examples what can be done easily. Maybe some of the alternatives to the current css could be had from there? They are like color-themes for Bootstrap.

Some good pointers on readability cab be found on [http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/05/02/applying-macrotypography-for-readable-web-page/ smashing-magazine]. Some more adjustments to the contrast and margins might improve readability a lot.

As someone mentioned on #emacs, the logo (wich does not link back to http://www.emacswiki.org/ btw) is chosen a bit poorly: ew doesn't sound very positive.

-- [http://funwithemacs.wordpress.com/ plovs] 2013-04-25 13:31 UTC

TBT, I've spent around a day on the layout, my goal being making something a little bit more interesting. I mostly changed bits that affected many pages, and didn't pay as much attention to details.

I don't think the gray background affects readability for most people - after all many people use low-contrast themes in emacs.

I think the criticism regrading the page width is valid. The best width readability-wise would probably be around 600. 900 is not as good, but it doesn't create a situation where the margins are bigger than the body on a wide-screen.

I will have a closer look at IE7 and IE8, and perhaps some things could be improved. Then again I don't think they are used much among computer-savvy users - which the particular website targets.

Even though I disabled the new design, it is now showing up at ElispArea.  Is there a workaround for this?  '''How to turn off the new design everywhere, including ElispArea?'''

-- DrewAdams 2013-04-25 14:47 UTC


----

I suppose the readability might improve a little if the default text color where changed from #333 to #000.

It might be possible to fix the lack flexibility on IE7/IE8 if some "width"s where substituted with "max-width"s.

-- cx 2013-04-25 18:59 UTC

Drew, it just works for me. I click the link, my cookie changes, and when I return to the Elisp Area, the look is changed. Perhaps you force a reload of those pages that refuse to update. (Control Shift R or something like that?)

Hm, I see now that [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=elisp-area;context=0 this link] appears to ignore the setting. I'll take a look tomorrow. I also got some emails from Evgeny, so expect some further improvements, soon.

Thanks for looking into it, Alex.

BTW, it's good that I prefer the old style, because the new style also tends to be very slow and can even freeze up my browser (IE7).  Just mentioning it, in case there are any other dinosaurs left in the forest.

Why make the line widths fixed by design instead of changeable by users?  Let users resize their browser windows as they like, getting the line widths and page shapes they want.

There's little worse than text that users cannot control using browser settings.  Hard-coded line widths and font sizes are no-no's for web-page design.  They might make for one person's idea of pretty, but they work against usability and user control.

-- DrewAdams 2013-04-26 03:47 UTC


----

Currently the only the maximum width is hard coded to 1170px. If one reduces the size of the window, the line width becomes smaller. Bootstrap uses "media-queries" to achieve this behavior, which evidently neither of your browsers supports. It should be possible however to broaden backward compatibility.

Hardcoding the maximum width provides better readability if someone tries to use the page with a maximized window. 

It's possible to change the font-sizes to percentages or ems, instead of pixels. There shouldn't be any serious downsides in doing so.

-- sabof 2013-04-26 05:26 UTC


----

Actually, Google Chrome does support both the things you mention (text zoom, line-width following browser width) --- I was wrong wrt that browser.  I still prefer the old design for readability, but I'm fine with choosing that for myself.

-- DrewAdams 2013-04-26 05:47 UTC

Drew, I finally remembered why the results of action=elisp-area don't take the cookie into account. These pages are pre-generated by a daily job and thus they cannot take your settings into account. Apache rewrite rules make sure you're being served these two files instead of the script output:

* http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/elisp-area.html, and
* http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/elisp-area-compact.html

I'm now producing "no bootstrap" versions of the files and added Apache rewrite rules that check your cookie. Thus, you should see the following two files:

* http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/elisp-area-no-bootstrap.html, and
* http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/elisp-area-compact-no-bootstrap.html

You may have to reload after changing your cookie because the caching for static files only depends on the last modified date, not on the value of your cookie.

-- AlexSchroeder 2013-04-26 08:23 UTC


----

I also applied all the changes Evgkeni sent me. Thanks!

-- AlexSchroeder 2013-04-26 08:26 UTC


----

Looking at EmacsWikiProblems I also felt that the TOC is very widely spaced so I changed it to:
{{{
div.toc li {
    font-size: 12px;
    line-height: 20px;
}
}}}

-- AlexSchroeder 2013-04-26 12:13 UTC


----

Thanks for looking into the ElispArea problem, Alex. But I don't understand what to do --- I still get the new style.  I went to this URL to turn it off:
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/2013-04-24?bootstrap=0

I deleted temporary files and closed the browser completely.  When I start it again and go to the ElispArea file listing, I still get the new style.  This is the URL:
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=elisp-area;context=0

What am I missing?  What do I need to do to turn off the new style completely?

Again, it's not just a problem of appearance; the new style slows down my system and practically hangs the browser, so I really want to turn it off.

Thx.

-- DrewAdams 2013-04-26 14:26 UTC


----

Another case where the new style keeps coming back:

I clicked the title of the page for ##zoom-frm.el## (which rendered OK, i.e., in the old style), to find pages that link to it.  I clicked the search hit for ##EmacsWiki: Set Fonts##, and it opened this page using the new style:
http://emacswiki.org/emacs/SetFonts.

And if I put this URL in a mail message and click it then my browser is opened to it using the new style:
http://emacswiki.org/emacs/SetFonts#ChangingFontSize.  But if I click a link on that page (which is displayed in the new style) then the page that opens is shown in the old style.

There needs to be a simple way to turn this new style off completely.

: Alex said: ''I'm now producing "no bootstrap" versions of the files and added Apache rewrite rules that check your cookie. Thus, you should see the following two files:''

** http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/elisp-area-no-bootstrap.html, and

: ''You may have to reload after changing your cookie because the caching for static files only depends on the last modified date, not on the value of your cookie.''

Doesn't help, AFAICT. When I follow those links directly I get to an old-style listing, but when I delete the cache and reopen the browser things are back to the new style.

And even in the same session after I click one of those links directly (which works), when I click the link at the ElispArea Download page for alphabetical listing, for example, it goes right back to the new style.

I really cannot use the new style listing of the ElispArea at all -- far too slow (essentially hangs the browser).

-- DrewAdams 2013-04-27 14:38 UTC

I'm at a loss to explain what you're seeing, Drew. At one point I thought perhaps you had the correct cookie set for emacswiki.org and the wrong cookie set for www.emacswiki.org (since cookies are domain-specific), but it's hard to tell. I'm still hoping to resolve this issue, but I'm out of ideas right now. I'm hoping for some insight in the next few days. :(

Here's what I did to test my cookie hypothesis. First, set up a broken environment:

# Visit http://emacswiki.org/emacs/zoom-frm.el?bootstrap=1 which enables the new style for emacswiki.org
# Visit http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/zoom-frm.el?bootstrap=0 which disables the new style for www.emacswiki.org
# Click on the header, I am shown a list of links by Google
# Click on the first one, for SetFonts
# I'm now looking at http://emacswiki.org/emacs/SetFonts which displays in the new style, which is expected (since that's how we set it up in step #1)

In order to fix this, you need to switch the theme "twice":

# Visit http://emacswiki.org/emacs/Comments_on_2013-04-24?bootstrap=0 for emacswiki.org
# Visit http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Comments_on_2013-04-24?bootstrap=0 for www.emacswiki.org

I'm not quite sure why Google is sending you to emacswiki.org instead of www.emacswiki.org – I'll take a look at the search engine definition.

-- AlexSchroeder 2013-04-27 15:06 UTC

----

I applied some more changes Evgkeni sent me. His Change Log:

* Better Mobile/IE compatibility
* Formatting for the "new comment" box
* Changed some fonts from pixels to ems, allowing text-only zooming in ie/chrome

Enjoy!

-- AlexSchroeder 2013-04-27 15:13 UTC

Alex -- I'm afraid it still doesn't work. I clicked each of those links for bootstrap=0 (www and no www).  I deleted cached files and history from my browser, and closed the browse.  I reopened the browser and went to the ElispArea, then clicked ##Downloading##, then ##Alphabetical list of all Elisp libraries on this Wiki##.  I got the new style for the list.

(Also, BTW, it did not recognize my ##Username## -- had to fill it in.  And even then it asks me to fill out the captcha.)

-- Anonymous 2013-04-27 19:21 UTC


----

And when I filled out the captcha after filling out my user name, it recorded Anonymous instead of my user name.  Trying again, again filling out both Username and captcha.

-- Anonymous 2013-04-27 19:22 UTC


----

Trying once more...

-- DrewAdams 2013-04-27 19:23 UTC


----

Apparently, it didn't like the captcha text I typed, and when I retyped it it put me back to anonymous. 

Anyway, closing and reopening the browser brings back the recaptcha and empty user name.  So apparently that is now broken also.  This is new since I tried those two URLs today.  I also found an old emacswiki cookie from 2011, and deleted that.  That had no effect either.

Sorry, but the wiki is currently pretty much unusable for me.

-- DrewAdams 2013-04-27 19:27 UTC


----

Did highlighting of Emacs Lisp files go away with the new design?

-- shjk 2013-04-27 21:28 UTC


----

I sure hope these problems get fixed soon. I still have a broken ElispArea, and I still have to enter my user name and fill out a captcha each time I want to save or preview edits (so multiple times when I visit the wiki).

Quite annoying.  I have nothing against others having a different wiki appearance that they prefer, but there should be some way for me to get back the old behavior.

-- DrewAdams 2013-04-30 02:11 UTC


----

shjk, I added it back. In fact, instead of using some weird library, I've written a new highlighter (see [[2013-04-30]]).

Drew, right now your browser is not handling cookies correctly: It's not recording your username, it's not recording the fact that you have added the captcha, and it's not recording the fact that you prefer the old style. The wiki itself hasn't changed. Just to be sure, let's try this URL:

http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-test/

It currently uses a config file that has all references to bootstrap removed. (Since the ElispArea is handled by a website configuration, it will not be affected by the use of the …/emacs-test URL).

-- AlexSchroeder 2013-04-30 07:35 UTC


----

Alex, the captcha and username problems are new, since you created the two different URLS.  That change did not help wrt getting the old style for ElispArea.  Before that change things were the same: no old style for ElispArea, no old style when clicking a search link, etc.  But at least the username and captcha were not problems.

Clicking the ##emacs-test## link gives me the SiteMap OK (old style).  Trying to click the ElispArea link from there took several minutes, then finally gave me something between the old and new styles: orange text on light gray background etc., ##Elisp Area!## as the header title (with `!').  But the text is at least similar to the original (old-style) font, except that it is smaller. If I click a file name and then choose Edit, I still get asked for the username and captcha.

My browser works fine elswhere than the wiki.  And prior to all the changes it worked fine for the wiki too.

-- DrewAdams 2013-04-30 13:01 UTC


----

Yes, as I said, I want to make sure http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-test/ works for you *before* I rethink the implementation of the ElispArea.

So, to confirm: If you use the emacs-test URL, the site works for you—username is remembered, captcha is only required once, it displays in the old style.

I think what I'll do next is change the mod_rewrite for the Elisp Area from an internal rewrite to a redirect.

In the meantime, I'm also using a mod_rewrite directive to redirect all emacswiki.org requests to www.emacswiki.org. Perhaps that helps reduce the cookie confusion I'm still suspecting.

-- AlexSchroeder 2013-04-30 14:02 UTC


----

We seem to be miscommunicating.  What I said wrt http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-test/  was that it did ''not'' seem to help at all.

Even for just that page, if I hit ##Edit##, I get asked for my username and captcha.  See my previous post for the other problems, e.g., for what happens if I go to ElispArea etc. (and for the color & font size changes).

-- Anonymous 2013-04-30 16:33 UTC


----

And again, the captcha I typed was rejected, and when I typed the new one my username was dropped.  What a PITA!

-- DrewAdams 2013-04-30 16:34 UTC


----

FWIW, I agree with Johnw , I like the modern look but IMHO contrast is not good .A fancy default with a simple fallback can be very reasonable. But, in all honesty, the css could use some work:
