= Description =

The position of cursor and buffer look are automatically remembered when a
scrolling command is invoked (page-down/page-up, mouse wheel scrolling,
scroll-bar movement)

This information is stored in a ring; you can go up and down this
ring restoring you position and text visibility before the scrolling
command with

* atim-unscroll-down (bound to [M-down])
* atim-unscroll-up   (bound to [M-up])

these commands travel the ring to older (..-down) and
newer (..-up) stored points.
