== Introduction ==

`w3m-search' provides a convenient interface to various internet
search engines.

`s' Search, fetching results in the current buffer, using your default search engine.
`S' Search, fetching results in a new buffer, using your default search engine.

Running either command with the default prefix `C-u' allows you to choose from any of
the non-default pre-configured searcg engines (and of course you can always customize and add your own).

See also: [[w3m support for Emacs Wiki]].

== Customization ==

The default search engine is set in `w3m-search-default-engine'. Its value should match an entry
in `w3m-search-engine-alist'. Both are defined using `defcustom' so you can use the emacs
customization-group interface to modify them.

=== Make the previous search engine the default for the next search ===

    (defadvice w3m-search (after change-default activate)
      (let ((engine (nth 1 minibuffer-history)))
	(when (assoc engine w3m-search-engine-alist)
	  (setq w3m-search-default-engine engine))))

=== Ideas for other search engines ===

Here are some more entries that can be added to
`w3m-search-engine-alist', as above:

* ("acronym" "http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?acronym=%s&string=exact")
* ("ebay" "http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?query=%s")
* ("google-groups" "http://www.google.com/groups?q=%s")
* ("syndic8" "http://www.syndic8.com/feedlist.php?ShowStatus=all&ShowMatch=%s")
* ("weather" "http://www.weather.com/search/search?where=%s&what=WeatherLocalUndeclared")
* ("wikipedia-en" "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=%s")
* ("worldclock" "http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/results.html?query=%s")

== Typing the search engine and query at once like Firefox ==

By default, google and yahoo have uri shortcuts defined, so from any url prompt, you can
type `gg:<your search string>' or `ya:<your search string>'.

Shortcuts are defined in variable `w3m-uri-replace-alist', which is defined using defcustom
for easy customization.
