This piece of code is an extension to WikiMode.  It adds the LANG
attribute to the BODY tag in HTML pages: Instead of <body> it now says
<body lang="en">.

Determining the buffer language must happen when the page is
published.  It happens in two stages.  First, we determine the
language of the current page using the function
`my-wiki-store-language' as a markup rule.  It doesn't add any markup:
It just stores the language in the variable `my-wiki-language'.
Later, we use the function `my-wiki-add-language' to insert the
language in the header.

This code requires a GuessBufferLanguage function.

 (defvar my-wiki-language nil)
 (defun my-wiki-store-language ()
 (setq my-wiki-language (guess-buffer-language)))
 (defun my-wiki-add-language ()
   (goto-char (point-min))
   (when (and my-wiki-language
              (search-forward "<body>" nil t))
     (replace-match (format "<body lang=\"%s\">" my-wiki-language))))

Now we need to install this in `wiki-pub-rules'.

 (add-to-list 'wiki-pub-rules 'my-wiki-add-language)
