GplMode provides font-locking and has functions to edit the values of colors (hue, saturation value, red, green and blue vals) in-place in a simple, intuitive, and lightweight fashion for .gpl color palette files used in programs such as the GIMP.

The methods and keybindings used are roughly the same as in CssColor, on which it depends.
