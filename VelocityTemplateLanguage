Velocity is a template engine. See http://velocity.apache.org/

It usually carries the extension .vm, or .vhtml.

==Mode to edit Velocity files in Emacs==

There is vtl.el which does syntax coloring of the keywords, variables and functions. See:
https://wiki.apache.org/velocity/EmacsVtlMode

This alone makes editing and detecting errors much more comfortable.
