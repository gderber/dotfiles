Three years ago, not so long after I became an emacser, I started to customize my favorite editor. During this time I developed a number of emacs enhancements that I still use daily with great satisfaction. Due to time constraints, however, I cannot provide a proper introduction for all of them, so I'm going to post "as is". Feel free to contact me at (dmr at c0nc3pt dot com) for extensions, information, ideas, etc.

Further stuff - not necessarily emacs-related - can be found in my personal [http://www.ethzero.com homepage]
