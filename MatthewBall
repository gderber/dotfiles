== Introduction ==
I am an Australian university student studying philosophy/linguistics.

I'm not much of a programmer, my interest in (GNU) Emacs is primarily focused on how it can be used as a writing environment.

== GNU Emacs ==
I am currently using GNU Emacs 25.

== Writing ==
Roughly, the tasks GNU Emacs easily accommodates which are of interest to myself can be classified as follows:

=== 1. Notes and Authoring ===
For notes and authoring I have found the following to be useful:
* [[OrgMode]]: I use [[OrgMode]] for most of my needs in GNU Emacs session; which is primarily writing.

- Most of my setup is tailored towards org-mode config. I have quite an extensive list of customisations/configurations, including a few personal functions.

=== 2. Dictionary, Spelling and Thesaurus ===
I'm still looking for a decent dictionary/thesaurus combination.

=== 3. References and Bibliography ===
For references and bibliography I have found the following to be useful:
* [[BibTeX]]
* [[RefTeX]]
* [http://ebib.sourceforge.net/ ebib]
* [[OrgRef]]

== Configuration ==
I will get around to cleaning up my dot emacs file and putting it online eventually.

My configuration is roughly 400 lines of emacs lisp, majority of which is org-mode functionality.

== Contact ==
I can be reached via email at "mathew.ball" at "gmail.com".

I spend a fair amount of time idling in [[EmacsChannel|#emacs]], and #org-mode channels on freenode under the nickname "[::chu]".
