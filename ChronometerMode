== chronometer.el == --- a [not so] simple chronometer for Emacs

== Commentary: ==

This is the first release, expect more in the next and feel free to feed me with patches, wishes, bugs and whatever you you think will worth it.

This mode is for counting times. I basically created it because I used to cook pizza while coding and I used to forget the time and a few minutes later I could smell a burned pizza.

You can use it for whatever purpose you like, but the typical scenario is to keep alerted of how much time has past.

To make it available for Emacs, put it in your `load-path' and insert (require 'chronometer) in your .emacs.

Use `chronometer' to start the chronometer, it will automaticaly start from zero and will keep incrementing every one second.

From now on you may want to play with the following keybindings:

* a - set alarm
* u - unset alarm
* p - toggle pause
* r - restart
* h - hide
* q - exit
* ? - help

== TODO: ==

* stop/start
* count down (maybe)
* allow more input formats for the alarm
* make it unable to set alarm to less then the elapsed time is
* execute a command when reach alarm
