Project management in Emacs.  Managing groups of files together, especially code.

== Full Project Management Libraries ==

These libraries (though they may be at varying stages of development) have the goal to be full project-management solutions.  Each offers its own way of thinking about a project, or uses a project definition created by another piece of software.

It is probably not useful to use more than one of these at the same time, for the same project.

* [http://cedet.sourceforge.net/projects.shtml CEDET]
* [http://wiki.github.com/jrockway/eproject eproject] -- assign files to projects, programatically
* a different library named [[eproject]] -- Project workspaces for Emacs.
* EtaskMode
* [[Icicles - Support for Projects]]
* JavaDevelopmentEnvironment
* [http://github.com/mattkeller/mk-project mk-project] --  Quickly switch between projects and perform operations on a per-project basis.
* [[project-buffer-mode.el]]
** FsProject -- plugin for ProjectBufferMode 
** [[IProject]] -- interactive project plugin for ProjectBufferMode 
** SlnMode -- SLN file plugin for ProjectBufferMode 
* [https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile projectile]
* [[Emacs-IDE]]
* [http://github.com/rdallasgray/project-persist project-persist.el] -- A minor mode to allow loading and saving of project settings.
* ProjmanMode -- emphasis on the ability to switch between projects
* SimpleProjectManagment
* [http://www.ozymandias.dk/emacs/emacs.html#vps vps] Projects as directory sets (by VagnJohansen).

== Project Helpers or Simplified Project Libraries ==

These libraries address some aspect of project management without trying to be all-in-one solutions.  You may find it helpful to use several of these at the same time, even in addition to the all-in-one solutions in the section above.

===  Searching ===
* FindFileInProject -- file finder
* [https://github.com/eglaysher/find-things-fast find-things-fast] -- leverage Git for faster searching
* [http://github.com/justinweiss/fuzzy-find-in-project fuzzy-find-in-project] -- file finder
* [[Gpicker]] -- file finder
* Lisp:ifind-mode.el -- file finder
* ProjectBufferOccur -- Occur plugin for ProjectBufferMode
* [http://github.com/technomancy/rinari/tree/master rinari-find-file-in-project] -- file finder
* [http://github.com/re5et/simp simp] -- file finder








=== Persistence ===
* GIT:desktop.el (included with Emacs) -- session saver
* MinimalSessionSaver -- session saver







=== Settings ===
* [[Profiles]] - Non-invasive user settings common to multiple projects.
* ProjectLocalVariables  -- settings which apply to multiple files





=== Navigation ===
* [[Bookmark+]] -- Tag files in different projects a la [[http://delicious.com|del.icio.us]]. Bookmark a set of files in arbitrary locations and jump to it in [[Dired]]. Save/restore Dired states (markings, expanded subdirs).
* EmacsCodeBrowser (ECB) -- navigation tools built on CEDET
* [[Icicles - Support for Projects]]
* IdeSkel -- Navigation framework








=== Templates ===
* ProjectWizard -- create stub files when starting a project



=== Workspaces ===

* DeskTop
* [http://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-window-manager e2wm]


* EmacsLispScreen
* EmacsScreen 
* [http://github.com/nex3/perspective-el perspective]
* WorkgroupsForWindows
* [[workspaces.el]]








== Utilities ==

These libraries have little to do with project management **per se**, but are handy when dealing with many files or buffers at once.

* MultiTerm
* DiredMode -- Operate on files.
