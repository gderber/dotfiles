ERC provides all the features that users expect from an IRC client:

* multi channels / multi servers: every channel is put in a separate buffer;  several IRC servers may be used at the same time.
* queries: private conversations are treated as channels, and are put into private buffers.
* highlighting: some occurences of words can be highlighted, thus easing conversation tracking (ErcHighlighting)
* notification: ERC can notify you that users are online (ErcNotify)
* channel tracking: channels can be hidden and conversation continue in the background.  You are notified when something is said in such a hidden channel. (ErcChannelTracking)
* nick completion: ERC can complete words so as to ease the writing of nicknames. (ErcCompletion)
* history: past actions are kept in history rings for future use. (ErcHistory)
* multi languages: messages are multilingual and can be customized. (ErcCatalog)
* user scripting: users can load scripts (e.g. auto greeting scripts) at ERC startup.

ERC works with both GNU Emacs and XEmacs; it also uses optional features specific to each flavour.  It can also use some Emacs modules, such as the BBDB (Big Brother Database).
