IrcClientSurvey says how I produced the list.

Manual fixes include merging "irssi" and "Irssi" as well as "xchat" and "X-Chat" (which orginally registered as "X").

Irssi, ERC, and XChat continue dominating the list.
I think irssi remains popular because people keep it running inside GNU screen sessions.

"Purple" seems to refer to libpurple which is used by Pidgin & Gaim.

Previous survey: [[2007-02-06]]. Next survey: [[2008-09-30]].
