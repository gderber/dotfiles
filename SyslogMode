syslog-mode.el is a mode for viewing system logfiles.

=== Configuration ===

Put syslog-mode.el in your load-path and add the following lines to your emacs configuration file:

 (require 'syslog-mode)
 (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/var/log.*\\'" . syslog-mode))

Tip: When you would easy move to the first line of your boot sequence configure the variable <code>syslog-boot-start-regexp</code> (default is <nowiki>SunOS</nowiki>) and use C-<down> in the syslog-mode.
