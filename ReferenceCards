Emacs is distributed with printable reference cards.

A file, `refcard.tex' (and `refcard.ps' in
<nowiki>PostScript</nowiki> format), which gives most of the
keybindings for basic editing.

If you do not have access to TeX or some sort of
<nowiki>PostScript</nowiki> interpreter like GhostScript, then http://refcards.com/ has PDF
versions of this, an XEmacs card, and one for AdvancedDeskCalculator as well.

An alternate Emacs reference card is available at http://www.mitchr.me/ as a PDF file.

I generated an Emacs 22 reference card from refcard.tex. Available at http://marc-abramowitz.com/archives/2006/04/10/emacs-22-reference-card/

Emacs 23 comes with a number of refcards, in tex and pdf format.
Most of them can be located from inside emacs with <code>M-x locate refcard</code>.
These cards are meant to be printed and folded so as to provide a quick reference
sheet to the most common shortcuts of emacs and its extensions.
