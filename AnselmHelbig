I use Emacs since 2001. Before that I used an ErsatzEmacs, JOVE.
Now I'm running GNU Emacs 23 from CVS. 

I'm writing Ruby, Javascript, CSS, XML, Python, PHP, CommonLisp and LaTeX with Emacs. Apart from that I read mail and news with WanderLust and chat with others using [[ERC]] (with bitlbee and two muh bouncers) and JabberEl. 

It's about time that I share some of my elisp hacks with my fellow hackers.
