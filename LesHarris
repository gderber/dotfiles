== Welcome ==
Welcome to my user page.  

I am an Emacs user though I am quite familiar with Vim (queue the boo/hisses) and tend to use both daily for various things.  I am a member of the Gnome foundation and do free software work over there.  

I would qualify myself as a journeyman-level emacs user: I have conformed to emacs and then with time made aspects of emacs conform to me.  However, no large elisp packages or major modes from me! The road to mastery is still long road for this one.


=== Cheers! ===

I salute your post-partisan view of editors, though I shan't ever be a fan of vi. ;)
