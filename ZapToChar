Emacs provides a [::zap-to-char] command that kills from the current point to a character.  It is bound to `M-z'.  Examples of its usage, include:

; `M-z e': deletes all characters to the next occurence of "e".
; Typing `C-u 2 M-z e': deletes all character to the *second* occurence of "e".
; Typing `C-- M-z e': deletes all characters to the /previous/ occurence of "e".
; Typing `C-u -4 M-z e': deletes all character to the *fourth* /previous/ occurence of "e".

See ZapToCharUsage for a discussion on using ZapToChar.

See ZapUpToChar for an alternative command that doesn't "zap" the char specified.

See FastNav for a collection of commands that jump to, replace at and doest other operations at the next/previous occurence of a character.
