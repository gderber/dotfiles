A tool to help with ELPA-like packages.

ElpaKit can do 2 useful things:

* it can make packages (mostly this is difficult for tar packages) from source files
* it can make local package archives full of packages from source files

This last feature is particularly useful if you want to use a LocalElpaArchive.

== Other things ElpaKit does ==

* keeps package tests separate from source files
* run tests in clean emacsen on packages built from source files
* run clean daemon servers with packages built from source files
* eval all the code you declare as being part of your package, which helps with development of packages
* provides a "project occur" so you can find things easily in your package source files
* manages processes used for testing and daemons with elpakit

== Get it ==
ElpaKit is available from marmalade.
