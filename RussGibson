I use Emacs.

Not new to Emacs in general - used MicroEmacs in the 80's and 90's, and GNU Emacs off and on since then.  Now am converting to using it full time, for all text work, especially coding.

Right now, I am fighting with mingw and msys to get compilation and such to work.  For me, the magic was this:

##(setenv "PATH" (concat "C:\\msys\\mingw\\bin;c:\\msys\\bin;" (getenv "PATH")))##
