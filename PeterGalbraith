My home page is http://people.debian.org/~psg

There's some Emacs lisp stuff near the bottom of that page, some also listed in
http://people.debian.org/~psg/elisp

At some point I'll copy the relevant parts here.

I use Emacs, develop for MH-E, maintain some Emacs related packages for Debian, and wrote font-latex.el and bib-cite.el (part of AUCTeX).
