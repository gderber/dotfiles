== Getting Started With Planner ==

At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to use PlannerMode
and related modules to keep track of your tasks, schedules and notes,
all within the convenience of Emacs. =) (People also recommend reading PlannerModeCommentary.)

== Getting the Files ==

You'll need at least PlannerMode and EmacsMuse. RememberMode works
really well for taking timestamped notes with PlannerMode, too.

Planner.el is available as planner-el on Debian systems.  Also, EmacsMuse is available as muse-el, and RememberMode is available as remember-el.

Install all the files somewhere on your system, like ~/elisp.

There are several different ways that you can obtain Planner and Muse,
depending on whether you want the latest stable releases or the
bleeding edge development version.

=== Getting the stable release ===

== Setting up Planner ==

Add the files to your load-path. Change these paths as needed.

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/muse/lisp")
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/planner")
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/remember")

Create your plan directory:

     mkdir ~/plans

Set up the project in your .emacs file:

     (setq planner-project "WikiPlanner")
     (setq muse-project-alist
           '(("WikiPlanner"
             ("~/plans"   ;; Or wherever you want your planner files to be
             :default "index"
             :major-mode planner-mode
	     :visit-link planner-visit-link))))
     (require 'planner)

Call M-x plan to start planning!

== Planning Your Day ==

There are two kinds of pages in a Planner wiki.

      Day pages:     Show tasks, schedule, and notes for the day
      Plan pages:    Organize related tasks and notes into a single page

Start planner with '''M-x plan RET'''.
(On OSX, Aqua emacs may respond to ENTER instead of RET.)

This will bring up the most recent day page with unfinished tasks or
create a new day page if necessary.

=== Tasks ==

==== Creating Tasks ==

Let us start by creating a task labelled

    Join the [[https://mail.gna.org/listinfo/planner-el-discuss][mailing list]]

From anywhere (including this page, if you're browsing from w3m and
have loaded planner-w3m! =) ), call '''M-x
planner-create-task-from-buffer''' to create a new task. Fill in the
description and choose a date by:

* typing 1-31 to put the task on that day of the month,
* accepting the default (today) by pressing RET,
* selecting the date with mouse-1,
* typing +n (where n is an integer) to schedule the task in n days time,
* typing +fri (or +mon, +tue, +wed, +thu, +fri, +sat, or +sun) for next Friday, etc.
* typing +2fri for two Fridays from now
* typing '''nil''' to make an undated task.

For now, accept the default (today) by pressing RET.

You will then be prompted for a plan page. Plan pages gather related
tasks and notes, giving you an overview of what you've done so far.
You can accept the default <nowiki>TaskPool</nowiki>, create your own
plan page, or specify '''nil''' to make a task that is not associated
with a plan page. For now, accept the default
(<nowiki>TaskPool</nowiki>) by pressing RET.

You have created your first task. View today's page with '''M-x
planner-goto-today'''. You will see a line of the form

    #B  _ Join the mailing list (TaskPool)

If you created the task from this page using w3m and you've loaded planner-w3m, then there will be an additional annotation:

    #B  _ Join the mailing list : <nowiki>http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PlannerModeQuickStart</nowiki> (TaskPool)

'''mailing list''', '''!TaskPool''' and
'''<nowiki>http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PlannerModeQuickStart</nowiki>''' are
hyperlinks. You can use TAB and S-TAB to navigate between them and RET
to follow the link.

Create more tasks using '''M-x planner-create-task-from-buffer'''.
This is bound to '''C-c C-t''' in planner-mode pages for your convenience.
For example, create the following tasks:

* '''Post my current way of working and how I would like to work''' for three days from now (+3),
* '''Learn how to schedule a task''', an undated task ("nil") on the <nowiki>TaskPool</nowiki> page.
* '''Browse through the PlannerMode info manual''' for today (. or accept the default),

: Tip: I bind planner-create-task-from-buffer to "F9 t" so that I can
  easily call it from anywhere. You can do that with this elisp
  fragment:

    (global-set-key (kbd "<f9> t") 'planner-create-task-from-buffer)

Visit the !TaskPool by:

* TAB-bing to it or using your TextCursor and typing RET to follow the link,
* '''C-x C-f !TaskPool RET''' to use find-file, or
* '''C-c C-f !TaskPool RET''' to use muse-find-file

You can see an overview of the tasks as scheduled on different days.
Unlike many personal information managers that store all of your data
in one file and then perform magic in order to present different
views, Planner uses plain text files. The data is duplicated and kept
updated by functions. This makes it simpler and easier to modify,
because what you see is (almost) what you get. On the other hand,
you'll need to get used to either editing both files, or using the
built-in functions for editing and updating files. If you prefer not
to work with linked tasks, you can configure Planner to use only plan
pages or use only day pages. (_After_ the tutorial =) )

The <nowiki>TaskPool</nowiki> page should list the tasks you created
earlier. Go to the one named '''Learn how to schedule a task'''. Type
'''C-c C-c''' (planner-copy-or-move-task) to schedule the task. Type
RET to accept the default (today). Go to the day page by following the
link or calling '''M-x planner-goto''' (C-c C-j C-d or the menu bar);
you will see the newly-created task there. You can also use '''C-c
C-c''' (planner-copy-or-move-task) to reschedule a task to an earlier
or later date.

Well, that task is done. To mark the task as completed, type '''C-c
C-x''' (planner-task-done). You can also edit the status manually
(change _ to X) as long as you remember to call M-x
planner-update-task to update the link page as well. Updating relies
on the task description being the same, so do not edit this manually.

Quick summary of task commands:

* Create a task: '''C-c C-t''' (planner-create-task-from-buffer), or type a task manually (call '''M-x planner-update-task''' if the task is linked)
* Mark a task as done: '''C-c C-x''' (planner-task-done), or edit the task and call '''M-x planner-update-task'''
* Edit a task description: '''M-x planner-edit-task-description'''
* Delete a task: '''M-x planner-delete-task'''
* Reorder tasks: '''M-p (planner-raise-task)''' and '''M-n (planner-lower-task)''', or edit the task and call '''M-x planner-update-task'''
  normal editing commands like kill and yank
* Change task priorities (#A > #B > #C):
  '''C-M-p (planner-raise-task-category)''' and '''C-M-n (planner-lower-task-category)''', or edit the task and call '''M-x planner-update-task'''.
* Change the plan of a task: '''M-x planner-replan-task''', or '''C-c C-c (planner-copy-or-move-task)''' with
  a plan page


These commands are explained in more detail later, but if you know how
to create tasks and mark them as done, you know all you need to know
in order to use Planner as a basic TODO manager. There's much more
than that, of course. =)

==== Organizing tasks ====

By default, tasks are created with medium priority (#B). You can make
a task high-priority (#A) or low-priority (#C) by manually editing the
task and calling '''M-x planner-update-task''' to update the linked
page. Alternatively, you can use '''C-M-p'''
(planner-raise-task-category) and '''C-M-n'''
(planner-lower-task-category) to modify the task and update the linked
page.

You can create other tasks and change their priority, simply by
editing the line and replacing the letter showing the priority. #A
tasks are important, #B are medium-priority, and #C are low-priority.
Higher-priority tasks are listed above lower-priority tasks, and
completed tasks are listed at the bottom.

You can organise tasks into groups by putting a blank line between
groups of tasks. PlannerMode will automatically maintain the groupings
and only sort the tasks within that group.

To remind yourself to do tasks in a certain order, simply edit the
lines so that they're in the order you want. You can use normal
editing commands like kill, yank and transpose-line to reorder the
tasks, or use '''M-p (planner-raise-task)''' and '''M-n (planner-lower-task)''' to
rearrange the tasks.

You save your tasks with C-x C-s the same way you save any other file,
or emacs will prompt you to save it when you exit.

==== Marking a Task as Completed ==

Tasks that are unfinished are marked with _ (underscore).
Tasks that are finished are marked with X (capital X).
This is an example of a high-priority task that is unfinished.

    #A  _ Write a tutorial

This is an example of a high-priority task that is finished.

    #A  X Write a tutorial

To mark a task as finished, type '''C-c C-x''' while the point is on
the task line. You can also change the status of a task by editing the
task and calling M-x planner-update-task.

==== Rescheduling Tasks ==

To reschedule a task to a different day, type '''C-c C-c'''
(planner-copy-or-move-task) and select a new date. For example,
'''C-c C-c +7 RET''' schedules a task for 7 days from the current page.

==== Rescheduling Many Tasks ==

You can mark a region and type '''M-x planner-copy-or-move-region''' to
reschedule all the contained tasks to a different date.

==== Deleting Tasks ==

Call '''M-x planner-delete-task''' to delete a task and update the linked page.

==== Carrying Over Unfinished Tasks ==

By default, (plan) carries forward unfinished tasks from the last 3 days.
Modify the '''planner-carry-tasks-forward''' variable for other behavior.

=== Schedule ==

This is pretty free-form. I usually have entries of the form

    hh:mm | hh:mm | activity
    hh:mm | hh:mm | activity
    hh:mm | hh:mm | activity

where hh:mm are expressed in 24h time. You can put anything in this section
or remove it from '''planner-day-page-template''' entirely.

=== Notes ==

You can put anything in this section. Notes added by remember-planner.el look like this:

    .#1 Headline
    Body

and are outlined at the H2 level.

==== Automatic note-taking with Planner and Remember ===

PlannerMode can easily integrate with RememberMode.  If you include the following in your startup:

  (require 'remember-planner)
  (setq remember-handler-functions '(remember-planner-append))
  (setq remember-annotation-functions planner-annotation-functions)

you can easily create context-aware notes. '''M-x remember'''
will create a dedicated buffer for you to fill in your note. Bind this to something handy like '''C-c r''' by adding this to your ~/.emacs:
  
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c r") 'remember)

If PlannerMode recognizes the buffer as one with context then it will
include a hyperlink at the bottom. Give the note a title, type your
info and you will have a note like:

  Example note for emacs wiki

  File I was looking at was
  [[/Users/jklymak/emacs-common/planner-config.el]] 
  when I made this note.

Typing '''C-c C-c''' after composing will prompt for the Wiki page to put this on (with auto-completion).  Choosing ComputerStuff will give a note like this on the page ComputerStuff

  .#1 Example note for emacs wiki 08:52 (2004.07.01#1)

  File I was looking at was 
  [[/Users/jklymak/emacs-common/planner-config.el]] 
  when I made this note.

And on the Daily page 2004.07.01

  .#1 Example note for emacs wiki 08:52 (ComputerStuff#1)

  File I was looking at was 
  [[/Users/jklymak/emacs-common/planner-config.el]] 
  when I made this note.


=== Planning Projects ===

The !TaskPool is a default Plan Page, on which tasks are created by default.  You can create other Plan Pages to group or organize a collection of related tasks into a project.

All the pages in your planner can contain links of the form !WikiName, <nowiki>[[destination]], or [[destination][description]].</nowiki> which will link to the alternate plan pages if they exist.

You can enable easy creation of !WikiName type links to Plan Pages in tasks with these incantations in your .elisp file:

   (require 'muse-wiki)    ;;; Allow wiki-links
   (setq muse-wiki-allow-nonexistent-wikiword t)
