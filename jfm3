In 2012, the Emacs community found an obituary that said Joseph F. Miklojcik III had died suddenly on June 2, 2011 at his home in Somerset, New Jersey. He was 41. According to his obituary in the //Home News Tribune//,[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/mycentraljersey/obituary.aspx?n=joseph-f-miklojcik&pid=151581037] Joe made "significant contributions" to !MongoDB and the GNU+Linux operating systems.  He studied computer science at Rutgers University and worked there after graduation for University Computing Services.  He went on to work at !ShopWiki.com, S7 Labs and then 10gen.  He wrote occasional posts that appeared on PlanetEmacsen from his blog, jfm3-repl.blogspot.com.   He authored the humorous paper about a hypothetical Lisp system called Phosphorous and maintained a C programming style manual call "Nectarine City Handbook". "He loved modular analog synthesizers and composing music in his free time. His great many friends remember him for his soft-spoken demeanor, his kindness, his sense of humor, and his infectious laughter."  He is surived by his wife and his parents.  His memorial requested contributions to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (www.eff.org), the International Snow Leopard Trust (www.snowleopard.org), or the Auden Family Relief Fund (www.alliancecrossroads.com).  His page on the Wiki is left as a tribute to an Emacs hacker.

In 1989, I went to work for a company called Unipress Software on a commercial product called Unipress Emacs. I learned after several years that GNU Emacs was better because the license made it so.  More people were working on it, and those people were users who cared.  Eventually I came to feel that selling NASA and other important world technology leaders something so obviously inferior was morally objectionable. I started using GNU Emacs to develop Unipress Emacs in 1991. I left Unipress around 1994.

In 1997 I went to work for Rutgers University. Around 1998 I decided that it was foolish to force information to behave like tangible property, and that copyright law had not only drifted far from it's original spirit (which was always obvious to me) but that the direction in which it was drifting was (and is) morally reprehensible. I eliminated as much non-free software from my life as possible. The occasional bit of firmware for the microwave oven still happens, but the amount seems to diminish every year.

Disgusted with most of the "Desktop" software I have to use to read email, plan my schedule, chat, etc., In late 2003 I started looking around for a platform to build a bunch of simple applications for myself. Everything I came across was either way to complicated and heavyweight, or had around two developers. In February of 2004, I rediscovered GNU Emacs, this time as an application platform. I now do everything I possibly can in emacs. This includes

* BbdbMode
* TrampMode
* EmacsIRCClient (with bitlbee)
* [[Gnus]]
* OrgMode
* WThreeM

I also run firefox and all that hoo-ha.

My music collection is in Ogg Vorbis format, thank you.

I have never run xemacs, nor have I developed an opinion on the politics of the matter.
