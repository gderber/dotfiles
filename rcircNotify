Libnotify notifications for [[rcirc]].

== Installation ==

Source:

* [https://github.com/nicferrier/rcirc-notify/blob/master/rcirc-notify.el rcirc-notify.el]
* [https://github.com/nicferrier/rcirc-notify GitHub repository with additonal documentation]

You can also download from marmalade-repo:

{{{
M-x package-install rcirc-notify
}}}

To install, put it in your LoadPath (or install from marmalade) and add the following to your InitFile:

    (eval-after-load 'rcirc '(require 'rcirc-notify))
    (eval-after-load 'rcirc '(rcirc-notify-add-hooks))

This library tries to use the following binaries to send the message:

; terminal-notify: Unsure where this is avaliable
; terminal-notifier: Works with new notifications in Mac OSX > 10.8
; notify-send: Available in packages libnotify-bin on Ubuntu, for example
; growlnotify: Newer Mac OSX
; osascript: Older Mac OSX


== How do I change the messages? ==

Redefine ##rcirc-notify-message##, ##rcirc-notify-keyword## and ##rcirc-notify-message-private##. Use %s for where you want the name of the person calling your name to go.


== How do I play a sound with the notification or perform some other action? ==

There's a hook called ##rcirc-notify-page-me-hooks##, just add your desired functionality there.


== OSX ==

If you're running Mac OS X 10.8 or newer (Mavericks up) install [https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier terminal-notifier] which is free and integrates with the new notification system in OS X.

If you're using an older version you need to use Growl. Install these applications:

* growl
* growlnotify

rcirc-notify tries to find growlnotify like this:

{{{
(executable-find "growlnotify")
}}}

if you can get that to work then probably rcirc-notify will work as well.


== Windows ==

Install [http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/ Growl for Windows] and run ##Growl.exe## in order to start the server.

Register Emacs by running the following command from a shell, eg. from [[eshell]]: ##"/Program Files (x86)/Growl for Windows/growlnotify.exe" /t:IRC /ai:http://www.emacswiki.org/pics/static/CarbonEmacsPackageIcon.png /a:Emacs /r:IRC /n:IRC foo##

Add the path to your ##exec-path##:

{{{
(add-to-list 'exec-path "C:/Program Files (x86)/Growl for Windows")
}}}

Test it by evaluating ##(my-page-me "foo")##.

*Problem: M-x* -- unfortunately Growl uses `M-x' [http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/help/default.aspx#actions as a shortcut]. You probably want to [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/growl-for-windows/luSpf9lQQRM change this].

# quit Growl
# edit ##%USERPROFILE%\appdata\local\growl\2.0.0.0\user.config##
# replace "Alt+X" with "Alt-Shift-Y" or whatever suits you
# restart Growl
