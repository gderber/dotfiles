HTML messages can be viewed in VM using the Emacs/W3M package.  Here
are the steps to get it working.  (''These instructions are for VM versions 8.1 and up.'')

* Check to ensure that you have '''W3M''' installed.  Most Linux
  distributions, the Cygwin distribution, and MacPorts for Mac OS X have 
  it pre-packaged.  Alternatively, you can install the latest version yourself.  See the
  [[w3m]] page for help.

* Install '''Emacs/W3M''' package, which is the Emacs interface to W3M.  See
  the [[emacs-w3m]] page for help.  

* In order for Emacs/W3M to work with the most recent GNU Emacs versions, you 
  need to install the development version of Emacs/W3M from CVS.

* It is a good idea to recompile VM with support for W3M included.  In
  the VM directory, run ./configure with the --with-other-dirs option
  including the directory /absolute/path/to/emacs-w3m.  (You can put
  multiple directories in this option separated by ";".)  Then run

          make clean
          make

* In your .emacs file, add the lines:

          (add-to-list 'load-path "/absolute/path/to/emacs-w3m")
          (require 'w3m-load)

* Remove any existing settings for vm-mime-text/html-handler in your
  .emacs and .vm files.

* Ensure that text/html is covered by vm-mime-internal-content-types
  and not covered by vm-mime-internal-content-type-exceptions.

* Restart Emacs and VM, and go to a message that has HTML content.  If
  it displays HTML content formatted nicely, you have it working.
  Otherwise, check the values of these variables inside VM:

** vm-mime-text/html-handler (should be 'emacs-w3m after VM loads the library)
** vm-mime-internal-content-types (should include text or text/html)
** vm-mime-internal-content-type-exceptions (should not have text or text/html)

=== Using external browsers ===

Normally, W3M opens URL's in the html pages internally.  To send them
to an external web browser registered in VM, use:

          (add-hook 'vm-presentation-mode-hook 
                       (lambda () 
                         (set (make-local-variable 'w3m-goto-article-function) 
                              vm-url-browser)))

Customize the variable vm-url-browser as appropriate to your needs.
