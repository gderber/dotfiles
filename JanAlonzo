Emacs has been part of my life for a few years now. It's an integral part of my day-to-day life with my computer. I use Emacs for

* Read emails and RSS feeds using CategoryGnus
* Practice GTD using OrgMode
* Content management, both offline and online, using EmacsMuse
* Twittering using an external mode and json.el
* Maintain personal contacts using BbdbMode
* Browse the web using emacs-w3m
* Maths stuff using imaxima-imath
* .. as well as text editing and code cutting.

I use GNU Emacs 23.x.
