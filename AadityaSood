Hi

I use Emacs. I'm [http://member.fsf.org FSF member] #1541, joined on 2003-08-25.

I have a blog at http://sood.net.in/journal.  I'm aadis on the EmacsChannel.

I've been using Emacs for some years now but I '''really''' started using it 3-4 months ago. Now I've customized it a bit ([http://emacswiki.org emacswiki] has been a great help, along with #emacs). Now I even read my mail using Gnus, which is awesome :-)

Other things I use are Planner and wiki mode (ofocurse the file editing too, and a bit of dired now and then).

===Nifty stuff I found===

* For ignoring case while completing files in minibuffer (very useful!) set read-file-name-completion-ignore-case to t
