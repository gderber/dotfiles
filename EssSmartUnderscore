Compatibility:

== Possible Dependencies ==

`custom', `easymenu', `ess', `ess-compat', `ess-custom',
`font-lock', `syntax', `widget'.

== Installation ==

To use without using a package manager:

* Put the library in a directory in the emacs load path, like ~/.emacs.d
* Add (require 'ess-smart-underscore) in your ~/.emacs file

This is in emacswiki, so this package can also be installed using el-get.

After installing el-get, Type M-x el-get-install ess-smart-underscore.
== Ess-Smart Underscore Package Information ==
Smart "_" key: insert <tt>ess-S-assign</tt>, unless:

# in string/comment
# after a $ (like d$one_two) (toggle with <tt>ess-S-underscore-after-$</tt>)
# when the underscore is part of a variable definition previously defined.
(toggle with `ess-S-underscore-after-defined')
# when the underscore is after a "=" or "<-" on the same line.
# inside a parenthetical statement () or [].
(toggle with <tt>ess-S-underscore-when-inside-paren</tt>)
# At the beginning of a line.
# In a variable that contains underscores already (for example foo_a)
(toggle with <tt>ess-S-underscore-when-variable-contains-underscores</tt>)
# The preceding character is not a tab/space (toggle with
<tt>ess-S-underscore-when-last-character-is-a-space</tt>.  Not enabled
by default.)

An exception to #4 is in the following situation:

<pre>
a <- b |
</pre>

Pressing an underscore here would produce


<pre>
a <- b <-
</pre>

However when in the following situation

<pre>
a <- b|
</pre>

Pressing an underscore would produce

<pre>
a <- b_
</pre>

This behavior can be toggled by <tt>ess-S-space-underscore-is-assignment</tt>

If the underscore key is pressed a second time, the assignment
operator is removed and replaced by the underscore.  <tt>ess-S-assign</tt>,
typically " <- ", can be customized.  In ESS modes other than R/S,
an underscore is always inserted.

In addition the ess-smart-underscore attempts to work with noweb-mode

== History ==

* <b>22-May-2013 </b> --   Added more ggplot operators.  (Matthew L. Fidler)
* <b>21-May-2013 </b> --   Added math to ggplot's functions... (Matthew L. Fidler)
* <b>21-May-2013 </b> --   Added hook to R-mode to make it behave a little better. (Matthew L. Fidler)
* <b>15-May-2013 </b> --   Fixed ess-smart-underscore to work in an inferior R process. (Matthew L. Fidler)
* <b>15-May-2013 </b> --   Added ggplot function prefixes.  (Matthew L. Fidler)
* <b>05-Nov-2012 </b> --   Better handling of noweb. I think it Came from Denis Haine and Martin Maechler. (Matthew L. Fidler)
* <b>22-Feb-2012 </b> --   Support unbalanced sexps. (Matthew L. Fidler)
* <b>02-Feb-2012 </b> --   Took out auto-installing. Most package managers don't want you to do this. (Matthew L. Fidler)
