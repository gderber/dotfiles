[[auto-pair+.el]] extends and modifies autopair.el  (see [[AutoPairs]]).

: I've contacted the author asking him for more information, and he has replied that he hadn't used it for a while and therefore he wasn't sure it did work with the most recent versions of autopair.el. This applies to auto-pair+.el "Last-Updated: Tue Nov 30 14:05:00 2010".

Since this package is abandoned, I have implemented the functionality of automatic escaping of quotes and escapes in region as a separate package, check it out https://github.com/MnZrK/autopair-escape-region.
