The octicon font by github (https://github.com/styleguide/css/7.0) provides some nice icons embedded in a font.
This package provides an easier access to them and must be used with the relevant face (octicons).

I do not provide the octicon font. You will need to install it yourself from the github styleguide site (search in the page source).
