=== Speech Recognition Engines ===

These are the programs implementing the actual speech recognition:
* !DragonDictate (proprietary license, Windows only) http://www.ddwin.com/dictate.htm
* Dragon !NaturallySpeaking (proprietary license, Windows only) http://www.ddwin.com/natural.htm
** Natlink is a Python library that interfaces with it. http://qh.antenna.nl/unimacro/index.html
* CMU Sphinx http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/sphinx
* Julius http://julius.osdn.jp/en_index.php

=== Interfaces for Emacs ===

There are several packages for driving Emacs through voice input, including:

==== a2x ====
Allows use of !DragonDictate from an X window system.

==== Dormant ====

===== VoiceCode =====
VoiceCode is an Emacs interface to Dragon !NaturallySpeaking (uses Natlink).
https://sourceforge.net/projects/voicecode/
The last update to the SVN repository was in 2013.

===== voicekey =====

http://sourceforge.net/projects/voicekey/ (unmaintained since August 2013, see https://sourceforge.net/p/voicekey/voicekey/ci/329cc8daac480349a3308121d9e8d35a01725ed4/)

===== vr-mode =====
Emacs interface to Dragon !NaturallySpeaking. 
http://emacs-vr-mode.sourceforge.net/
[new]
The last release announcement (as of Oct 2013) was in 2007...
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=emacs-vr-mode-announce
[new]
:: It seems that vr does only work with Emacs on W32. Is there any equivalent using Dragon Naturally Speaking in a virtual network? I know something like this existed.

===== ShortTalk and EmacsListen =====
EmacsListen is an implemention of ShortTalk. It is based on vr-mode.

http://shorttalk-emacs.sourceforge.net/

=== Microphones ===
* It is very important to have a very good noise-canceling microphone.   One source I have come across is the compatibility list of (the NON-FREE) dragon naturally speaking software -- go for the few that meet their highest rating (six stars).
