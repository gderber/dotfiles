The SiteMap was remodeled today, thanks to the motivation of DrewAdams.  Improvements include

* an introduction to the site,
* an introduction to the well-known navigation links,
* an introduction to the "category" system,
* changes to the SiteMap headings (and table of contents, consequently), and
* an overall better tutorial for new visitors.

More information is at SiteMapDiscussion.
