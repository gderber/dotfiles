* Render status switch.
* *Smart* table and content navigation.
* Visit RFC link around point.
* Jump to RFC reference around point.
* Jump to heading name with completion.

==Customize==
All below option can customize by: M-x customize-group RET irfc RET

  include the RFC document's title
* "irfc-highlight-requirement-keywords" whether RFC requirement
  keywords specified in `irfc-requirement-keywords' list
  should be highlighted using the face specified by
  `irfc-requirement-keyword-face'.
* "irfc-requirement-keywords" list of RFC requirement keywords to
  highlight if `irfc-highlight-requirement-keywords' is t.
* "irfc-highlight-references" whether RFC references should be
  highlighted using the face specified by `irfc-reference-face'.

==Tips==
* You can use command `irfc-render-toggle' to toggle render status.

* Command `irfc-table-jump' can navigation between table and content,
example you stay cursor at *table*, and type "G" will jump corresponding
content in buffer, alike, you can stay at any content and type "G"
will jump corresponding table item.

* Command `irfc-visit' will ask the user for a RFC number and will
visit that document, either from `irfc-directory', if exists, or by
downloading it.  This command can serve as entry point for Irfc,
to go to a RFC without having to visit the file or remember
whether it is already in `irfc-directory'.
And if you visit same document with your previous type, so just
hit RET, and don't need type RFC document number.

* Command `irfc-follow' will visit RFC document around point,
example you stay cursor at "[RFC3986]", and type "o" will
open rfc3986.txt in storage directory. If have not found
this file in directory, will download from `http://www.ietf.org/rfc/'
and open it when download complete.
: And command `irfc-follow' can also use at title of RFC document.
: Example rfc3986.txt contain "Obsoletes: 2732, 2396, 1808" at title, you can move cursor to "2732" and type "o" will visit RFC 2732 document.
: `irfc-follow' support below keywords in title:
:: "Request for Comments:" 
:: "Updates:"
:: "Obsoletes:"

* Command `irfc-reference-goto' will ask the user for a reference
number and will jump to that citation in the Normative
References/Informative References heading.

* Command `irfc-rfc-link-next' and `irfc-rfc-link-prev' can jump next or previous RFC link in document.

* Command `irfc-head-goto' will ask the user for a heading name and
will jump to that heading.  Completion list in minibuffer is
available.

* Command `irfc-head-number-goto' will ask the user for a heading
number and will jump to that heading.  Completion list in minibuffer
is available.

==Related==
* Integrate with [[Anything]]:
** Install:
:: Put Lisp:anything.el and Lisp:anything-irfc.el in your load-path, then add
{{{
        (require 'anything-irfc)
}}}
:: in your ~/.emacs
** Usage:
### You can use the command `anything-irfc-table-jump' to jump table or content. 
### Or you can also integrate this package with [[Anything]]:
{{{
            (setq anything-sources
                  (list
                   anything-c-source-irfc-table-jump
                   ))
}}}
** Tips:
### When you use [[Anything]] interface, you can type "TAB" to switch second-level interface for more command for same candidate.
