When used in dired, ls-lisp shows normally lots of status info per file in front of the file name which sometimes makes reading the file name cumbersome.

In order to gain more real estate for the file name it can be useful to switch off user and group info. I have written a little function which toggles this info on and off with the necessary redraw:

    (defun leo-toggle-ls-lisp-verbosity ()
      (interactive)
      (if (memq 'uid ls-lisp-verbosity)
          (progn
            (setq ls-lisp-verbosity (delq 'uid ls-lisp-verbosity))
            (setq ls-lisp-verbosity (delq 'gid ls-lisp-verbosity))
            (revert-buffer)
            (message "uid & gid hidden"))
        (progn
          (add-to-list 'ls-lisp-verbosity 'uid)
          (add-to-list 'ls-lisp-verbosity 'gid)
          (revert-buffer)
          (message "uid & gid visible"))))

I have bound it to C-p in dired mode:

    (add-hook 'dired-load-hook
       (lambda ()
         (define-key dired-mode-map "\C-p" 
                            'leo-toggle-ls-lisp-verbosity)))

If you want to get rid of verbosity forever you can add following lines to the "~/.emacs":

<pre>
(custom-set-variables
 '(ls-lisp-verbosity nil))
</pre>

More information about ls-lisp-verbosity can be found in GNU Emacs Manual chapter "G.4 Emulation of ls on MS-Windows".

Both previous methods will leave file permissions field like "drwxrwxrwx", if you want to hide it also then you can use following code:
<pre>
(defadvice ls-lisp-format (around my-ls-lisp-format 
  (file-name file-attr file-size switches time-index now))
  "Advice definition which removes unnecessary information
during file listing in dired. For such purposes 
`ls-lisp-verbosity' customized variable can be used, but 
even if it is equal to nil dired will display file 
permissions field like \"drwxrwxrwx\".\. So here we just 
get full control to what dired shows and leave only those 
fields which we need."
  (progn
    ad-do-it
    (setq ad-return-value (concat 
      (substring ad-return-value 0 1)
      (substring ad-return-value 13)))))
(ad-activate 'ls-lisp-format t)
</pre>
You should add it to "~/.emacs".
