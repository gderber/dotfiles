I use GNU Emacs on a lotta platforms, lately mostly [http://www.linuxmint.com/ Mint]. My init.el is a horrible mound of cruft, but someday I'll make it right.

I hope some day to be worthy of listing on the same page with Kai Grossjohann, Jari Aalto, Eric Ludlam, Barry Warsaw, Jim Blandy, Kim Storm, Eli Zaretskii, much less Richard Stallman or Donald Knuth. But you guessed :-)
