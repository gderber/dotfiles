You can organize your groups into different topics in the ##*Group*## buffer.
First make sure ##gnus-topic-mode## is added to the ##gnus-group-mode-hook##, then use the options in the *Topics* menu to organize your groups into topics.

You can use ##gnus-topic-goto-previous-topic## and ##gnus-topic-goto-next-topic## (bound to **T M-p** and **T M-n** by default) to jump to the next/previous topic but I find these command awkward as they do not move up/down levels of indentation.
I prefer to use the following commands instead:

    (defun gnus-topic-goto-previous-topic-line nil
      "Goto the previous visible topic line.
    A replacement for `gnus-topic-goto-previous-topic'."
      (interactive)
      (goto-char (previous-single-property-change
                  (line-beginning-position) 'gnus-topic nil (point-min))))
    
    (defun gnus-topic-goto-next-topic-line nil
      "Goto the next visible topic line.
    A replacement for `gnus-topic-goto-next-topic'."
      (interactive)
      (goto-char (next-single-property-change
                  (line-end-position) 'gnus-topic nil (point-max))))


Another annoyance for me is that by default the **<tab>** key is bound to ##gnus-topic-indent##, and I often found myself
pressing it by mistake when I meant to fold a topic.
By default topics can only be folded when the cursor is on a topic line. The following command fixes that:

    (defun gnus-topic-fold-this-topic nil
      "Toggle folding of current topic."
      (interactive)
      (gnus-topic-goto-topic (gnus-current-topic))
      (gnus-topic-fold))

I bind this command to **<tab>** to avoid the previously mentioned annoyance.
