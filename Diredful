This package provides a simple way to customize [[DiredMode]] to display files in different faces and colors. Faces are chosen based on file extension,
file name, or a regexp matching the file line.

==Install==

Using Melpa:

 M-x package-install RET diredful RET

Then to activate add the following into your init file:

 (diredful-mode 1)

For manual installation, put diredful.el in your Emacs-Lisp load
path, and add this to your init file:

 (require 'diredful)
 (diredful-mode 1)

Diredful.el is available at github: https://github.com/thamer/diredful

==Usage==

Do:

 M-x diredful-add

This will ask you to define a new name for a new file type, like "Images". You can then customize a face using a widget.el buffer (see screenshot below). Faces will be automatically generated and updated for each file type.

File Types can be added, edited, or deleted using the following commands:

 M-x diredful-add
 M-x diredful-edit
 M-x diredful-delete
 M-x diredful-edit-file-at-point

Note that changes will only apply to newly created dired buffers.

Settings will be saved to the location of `diredful-init-file' (by default it is "~/.emacs.d/diredful-conf.el"). You may choose a different location by doing:

 M-x customize-variable diredful-init-file

==Tips==

File type names are sorted alphabetically before being processed. In case two file types have matched the same file, the file type that comes last in an alphabetically-sorted list will take precedence (e.g., zworldwritable). 

The world-writable regexp pattern used in the screenshot is <code>[rwx-][rwx-][rwx-][rwx-][rwx-][rwx-][rwx-]w[trwx-]</code>
