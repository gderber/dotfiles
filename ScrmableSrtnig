: Very silly package but quite fun :) -- XavierMaillard

== No Such Study ==
Actually this study was not really done.  It seems that this news that is spreading so incredibly fast through the web might be an experiment on modern legend creation.  There is a quite good German article at

http://www.heise.de/tp/deutsch/special/auf/15701/1.html

which also points to english resources that discuss this.
Of course I don't know whether that article is totally correct ;-)

== Limitations ==
The above algorithm works only for simple texts with short words.  When the scrmabling is performed over several syllables the text becomes more and more unreadable.  I'd propose a modified algorithm that first does a syllable decomposition and then scrmables those letters.  Another approach might be to limit the size of the jump of each letter to a gaussian distribution or something like that. -- StefanKamphausen

== Emacs 23 ==
Note that you will have to use (split-string word "" t) with emacs 23 to make this work.
