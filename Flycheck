[http://www.flycheck.org Flycheck] is a modern on-the-fly syntax checking extension, and a modern alternative to Flymake. It supports [http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/languages.html many languages] with many different syntax checkers out of the box.

== JSLint with Flycheck ==

As of April 2016, Flycheck has no built in support for JSLint (but does include support for jshint, eslint, and gjslint). Fortunately support is straight forward to add.

1. Install [http://nodejs.org/ Node.js] and NPM.

2. Install JSLinter:

<pre>
npm install jslinter -g
</pre>

3. Add to <code>~/.emacs</code> (adapt <code>:command</code> according to your system):

<pre>
(require 'json)
(require 'flycheck)
(defun my-parse-jslinter-warning (warning)
  (flycheck-error-new
   :line (1+ (cdr (assoc 'line warning)))
   :column (1+ (cdr (assoc 'column warning)))
   :message (cdr (assoc 'message warning))
   :level 'error
   :buffer (current-buffer)
   :checker 'javascript-jslinter))
(defun jslinter-error-parser (output checker buffer)
  (mapcar 'parse-jslinter-warning
          (cdr (assoc 'warnings (aref (json-read-from-string output) 0)))))
(flycheck-define-checker javascript-jslinter
  "A JavaScript syntax and style checker based on JSLinter.

See URL `https://github.com/tensor5/JSLinter'."
  :command ("c:/Users/Felix/AppData/Roaming/npm/jslint" "--raw" source)
  :error-parser jslinter-error-parser
  :modes (js-mode js2-mode js3-mode))
</pre>

4. Restart Emacs to make sure everything loads fine.

5. Test.
