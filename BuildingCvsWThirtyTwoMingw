BuildingEmacsWithMinGW talks about the same things as this page, but that page is just a batch file.  I've been building CVS Emacs for Win32, using a mixture of CygWin and MinGW, regularly for months.  Here's what I did:

* install all of CygWin (Note that you don't <em>really</em> need all of Cygwin; in fact I think you just need a few simple programs like <tt>cp</tt> and <tt>mv</tt>, and the shell.  But I don't know exactly what those programs are, and I tend to use all of Cygwin already anyway.)
* install just [[http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe?download MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe]]
* check out emacs (use a Cygwin shell for this):

 cd /usr/local
 mkdir src
 cd src
 cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/emacs co emacs
* build it (use a Cygwin shell for this, too):

 cd emacs/nt
 PATH=/c/mingw/bin:$PATH
 /c/mingw/bin/make
 /c/mingw/bin/make recompile
 /c/mingw/bin/make install

* I followed your steps I got this error:

 $ make
 [Please ignore a syntax error on the next line - it is intentional]
 /bin/sh.exe: -c: line 1: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'
 /bin/sh.exe: -c: line 2: syntax error: unexpected end of file
 ', needed by `which-sh'.  Stop.t `

* Any ideas?



= A guide for building Emacs with MinGW =

I have put together a beginners guide for building CVS Emacs with MinGW.
This guide is available in [[EmacsW32]] and at the website mentioned on that page. 
You do not have to use Cygwin with this guide.
The guide mentions what you need instead.
Too make it a bit easier I have also made a small perl script to check the building environment 
and a cmd file to automate it all from checkout CVS to installation. 

I have found the guide below for images support very good so I have shamelessly included it in my guide above.

* Can you please give the link to the guide?

= A guide for images support =

Several images library is necessory for images support in CVS Emacs. All of them can be downloaded at http://gnuwin32.sf.net. Both the bin packages(for .dll files) and the lib or src packages(for .h files) should be downloaded first. Files of .dll is for runtime, and .h for compiling.

* JPEG support
** Required files: jpeg62.dll, jconfig.h (in *bin* & *lib* packages)
** Current: jpeg-6b-4-bin.zip, jpeg-6b-4-lib.zip
* GIF support
** Required files: libungif.dll, gif_lib.h (in *bin* & *src* packages)
** Current: libungif-4.1.0b1-bin.zip, libungif-4.1.0b1-src.zip
* TIFF support
** Required files: libtiff3.dll, tiffio.h, tiff.h, tiffvers.h (in *bin* & *lib* packages)
** Current: tiff-3.7.2-bin.zip, tiff-3.7.2-lib.zip
* XPM support
** Required files: xpm4.dll, X11/xpm.h, simx.h (in *bin* & *lib* & *src* packages)
** Current: xpm-3.5.1-1-bin.zip, xpm-3.5.1-1-lib.zip, xpm-3.5.1-1-src.zip
* PNG support
** Required files: libpng13.dll, png.h, pngconf.h (in *bin* & *lib* packages)
** Current: libpng-1.2.8-bin.zip, libpng-1.2.8-lib.zip
* Zlib (required by PNG)
** Required files: zlib1.dll (in *bin* packages)
** Current: zlib-1.2.2-bin.zip

You still need to copy the ##simx.h## from ##src\xpm\3.5.1\libXpm-3.5.1-src\lib## to the ##include\## directory of your gnuwin32 installation. ##configure.bat## throws an error "linker input file unused because linking not done" if you forget to define this preprocessor macro XPM_NO_X as an argument to the ##configure.bat## script. (If you view
##simx.h## using a text editor, you will notice that the functionality depends on XPM_NO_X being defined.)

Assuming all required .h files are in ##C:\free_ware\gnuwin32\include##. Run ##cmd.exe##, then to ##cvs-emacs\nt## directory:

 emacs\nt> configure.bat -h
 emacs\nt> configure.bat --with-gcc --cflags -IC:/free_ware/gnuwin32/include --cflags -IC:/free_ware/gnuwin32/src/lib --cflags -DXPM_NO_X
 emacs\nt> dos2unix makefile
 emacs\nt> make bootstrap

Copy all .dll files to the directory ##EMACS_INSTALL_DIR\bin##, so this Emacs will support images.

Sidenote:
On some GNUWin32 installations, you may get build errors.  In that case, you can install the libjpeg, libpng, zlib, libtiff, Xpm, and giflib libraries in a separate place (say, ##C:/gnutemp/##), and use this path instead of the one used above (##C:/free_ware/gnuwin32/##).  You can also use the ##--prefix## flag to tell ##configure.bat## where you would like GNU Emacs installed.  Also, don't forget to copy the .dll files in ##C:/gnutemp/bin## to the ##EMACS_INSTALL_DIR\bin## directory as stated above.

Warning:
Do *NOT* append a trailing backslash or forward slash to any of the directory paths in the build commands.
