I was amazed to find that there's no mode for editing grammar files in BNF format. Here's a small contribution which does some syntax highlighting.

<pre>
(define-generic-mode 'bnf-mode
 () ;; comment char: inapplicable because # must be at start of line
 nil ;; keywords
 '(
   ("^#.*" . 'font-lock-comment-face) ;; comments at start of line
   ("^<[^ \t\n]*?>" . 'font-lock-function-name-face) ;; LHS nonterminals
   ("<[^ \t\n]*?>" . 'font-lock-builtin-face) ;; other nonterminals
   ("::=" . 'font-lock-const-face) ;; "goes-to" symbol
   ("\|" . 'font-lock-warning-face) ;; "OR" symbol
   )
 '("\\.bnf\\'") ;; filename suffixes
 nil ;; extra function hooks
 "Major mode for BNF highlighting.")
</pre>

That sounds like it could be useful when using Vinicius's [[ViniciusJoseLatorre#toc3|EBNF2PS]]. -- DrewAdams
