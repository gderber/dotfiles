<code>man-preview.el</code> formats and displays manpage source out of an Emacs buffer.  You can use it when editing page source, or when browsing page sources in for instance a TarMode subfile.  Get it from

When editing the best feature is that a re-preview keeps the preview buffer at the same line position, so you can make a change and re-preview to see how it comes out.
