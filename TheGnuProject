[http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html The GNU Project], as
explained by RichardStallman in the book "Open Sources", starts
as follows:

: When I started working at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1971,
I became part of a software-sharing community that had existed for
many years.  Sharing of software was not limited to our particular
community; it is as old as computers, just as sharing of recipes is as
old as cooking.  But we did it more than most.
