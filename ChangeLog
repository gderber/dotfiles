When you modify code under a VersionControl (VC) system, you might want to
create a ChangeLog automatically.  `C-x v a' may do
what you need.

If you maintain the log manually, use `C-x 4 a' to add a new !ChangeLog entry.
If you run `C-x 4 a' in a hunk of a patch generated with `M-x vc-diff', `M-x diff', `M-x diff-backup' -- or any of the DiffMode producing commands, it will automatically determine and insert the function name into the !ChangeLog entry.  Repeatedly type `C-x 4 a' for each hunk of the patch, and write an entry in the !ChangeLog file.

A !ChangeLog file itself is edited in Emacs using ChangeLogMode.

To merge !ChangeLog files but maintain the chronological order, use `M-x change-log-merge'.

For more about !ChangeLog files, see http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Change-Log.html.

Gnulib contains a merge driver for !ChangeLog files to be used with VCS' like git, bzr, or mercurial.  See the [[GitForEmacsDevs#MergeChangeLog]] for more info.
