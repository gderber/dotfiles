I use Emacs. Specifically I currently use GNU/Emacs 23.1! The first version I used was 21.3 on a Slackware Linux. 

I mainly use Emacs with Gnus, Org-mode and as an everyday editor for my daily needs.

I love the zenburn color theme and when possible (read: when X11 is available) use the Droid Sans Mono font. 

I sometimes blog about emacs [[http://blog.ltsampros.eu/category/emacs/ here]].
