A quick and dirty way to replace all notepad.exe calls would be to use the Registry:

1. Start [tt]regedit.exe[/tt]

2. Go to [tt]HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options[/tt]

3. Add a new key named [tt]notepad.exe[/tt]

4. Add (in there) a new string named [tt]Debugger[/tt] and use this value: [tt]emacsclientw.exe -na runemacs.exe -F[/tt]

Note that this will pretty much break the usual "-F" behavior but it is needed as Emacsclientw has no [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2984846/set-image-file-execution-options-will-always-open-the-named-exe-file-as-defaul -z parameter] (yet).

I know this is a pretty old post, but maybe someone will find this useful. for the debugger value this works much better 
emacsclientw.exe -c -a runemacs.exe -F "%1"
if you leave off the "%1" then it wont open the file you click.
