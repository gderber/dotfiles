This page describes library '''<tt>[[modeline-char.el]]</tt>'''.

It defines minor mode '''`mlc-char-in-mode-line-mode''''.  When turned on, it shows the character after [[point]] in a [[mode-line]] lighter.  You can use the ''global'' minor mode 
'''`mlc-char-in-mode-line-mode-global'''' to do this for every buffer.

The character is shown (in the mode-line) highlighted with face `mlc-mode-line-char-format', followed by  `=', followed by the hexadecimal Unicode code point for the character, highlighted with face `mlc-mode-line-char-format-code'.

For example, with point before the character `e' it shows:

    e=000065

with `e' and `000065' highlighted.

You thus have a dynamically updated view at all times of what the character at the [[cursor]] is.

In addition:

* If you click '''`mouse-1'''' on the lighter then full information about the character is shown in buffer `*Help*', including the font and faces used (for the character in the buffer, not for the lighter in the mode-line).
   
* If you click '''`mouse-2'''' on the lighter then the character is copied to the [[SecondarySelection|secondary selection]].

* If you click '''`mouse-3'''' on the lighter then the character is shown enlarged in a tooltip.
