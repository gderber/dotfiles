I'm GoktugKayaalp ([http://www.gkayaalp.com my homepage]).  Emacs is my OS, I do most of my computer tasks in it.

== My Elisp programmes ==

See my [http://www.gkayaalp.com/emacs.html Emacs page] for up-to-date information.

== Input methods ==

I use Emacs quail input methods all the time, and have created some (subjectively) convenient ones.  Here is a listing:

* [http://www.gkayaalp.com/emacs.html#gk-unilat.el Universal Latin Input Method]:\\
Meant to be a single input method for most (ideally all) variants of the Latin alphabet.  It's available on [http://www.gkayaalp.com/releases/ my website] and here at Lisp:gk-unilat.el.

* [http://www.gkayaalp.com/emacs.html#gk-greek.el Transliterating input method for modern Greek]:\\
Aimed to ease up typing *modern* Greek on Latin keyboards, this is a mapping from Latin transliterations of Greek letters to their original Greek versions.  Allows to type transliteration and obtain on-the-fly Greek text.  It's available on [http://www.gkayaalp.com/releases/ my website] and here at Lisp:gk-greek.el.
