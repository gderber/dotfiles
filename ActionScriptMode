== Notes ==

* There are several entirely different modes all called actionscript-mode.
* You may need to rename the below-files to actionscript-mode.el to make them work.

== For AS3 ==

!ActionScript 3 is used in Adobe's Flex 2 and above

Austin Haas has created an actionscript-mode for AS3:

* [https://github.com/austinhaas/actionscript-mode Latest version here]
* A recent version is archived here: Lisp:actionscript-mode-haas-7.0.el
** This does not work with newer Emacsen (CC-mode 5.30 and up)
*** Is this comment referring to an older version? Because there was a time when my actionscript-mode didn't work with Emacs22, but it wasn't this version. As far as I know, this version works fine and it doesn't depend on cc-mode at all. - Austin Haas
*** At first glance, the Github head seems to work fine for me in GNU Emacs 24.4.
** Also, there are a few indentation bugs.
*** This is true. I borrowed the tabbing code from Aemon Cannon's as3-mode, which is [https://github.com/aemoncannon/as3-mode/blob/master/as3-mode.el here]. It's a smart but simple approach and doing a complete tabbing solution is beyond my limits. - Austin Haas
* Somewhat older version which indents correctly and works with newer Emacsen: Lisp:actionscript-mode-haas-5.6.el
** This is the version that SHOULD NOT work with newer Emacsen since it depends on an older cc-mode. I don't understand why someone is claiming the opposite. - Austin Haas
** If I recall correctly, the reason that indenting appears to work in this version is because it was utilizing cc-mode, and although it appeared mostly correct, it was somewhat by chance because the internals of cc-mode were actually mis-classifying the tokens but indenting still put them in the right place. Unfortunately, I ran into problems elsewhere when I wanted that classification to be correct. Plus, a newer version of CC-mode made it's way into Emacs22 and it required an overhaul of actionscript-mode to conform to it, so at that point I thought it would be better to severe the dependency. - Austin Haas

John Connors has also created an actionscript-mode for AS3: Lisp:actionscript-mode-connors.el

This [Connor's mode] works for me in Aquamacs under OS X.  Thanks for making it available.

This [Connor's mode] somewhat works for me (AmitPatel), but indentation of nested array literals doesn't indent properly.  For example, 
<pre>
public var sides:Array = [
[new Point(300, 300), new Point(300, 100)],
[new Point(300, 100), new Point(100, 100)],
[new Point(100, 100), new Point(100, 300)],
[new Point(100, 300), new Point(300, 300)]
                            ];
</pre>
