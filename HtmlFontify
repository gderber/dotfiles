Htmlfontify, by VivekDasmohapatra, turns an Emacs buffer into display-equivalent html. The author says, "Once I got that far, I just sort of got
carried away and modified it to be able to html-ise and cross link a
source tree using etags, etc..."  Get it from the emacs source, it's been included here:
[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/lisp/htmlfontify.el htmlfontify.el]

An example of the output from the new version of htmlfontify can be found
[http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/htmlfontify-example.html here]

Try it online at: http://rtfm.etla.org/cgi-bin/htmlfontify.cgi
[But don't get the source from rtfm, that's the old emacs21 version]
