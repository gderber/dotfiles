All of the true things that I am about to tell you are shameless lies...

If you follow RecentChanges, you will see that more and more of the entries are about a package called [[Icicles]]. I have discovered the terrible reason for this:

Icicles is Ice-9!!!

Many already suspected that Emacs is our karass (vi is a granfalloon). How many of us have whispered "busy, busy, busy" when coding Elisp? Now it is clear that Icicles is our wampeter.

We know what happens when Ice-9 is released. You can already see it happening if you look at RecentChanges. Slowly, inexorably, Icicles is spreading. It is subsuming everything in Emacs, turning it all into Icicles. One day soon, everything will be Icicles. And there's nothing we can do to stop it. It is zah-mah-ki-bo.


From Bokonon's fifty-third calypso:

<pre>
Oh, an idle timer
At the active mark,
And a regexp-hunter
In parenthesis dark,
And a built-in doctor,
And a many-buffer screen--
All fit together
In the Lisp machine.
Nice, nice, very nice;
Nice, nice, very nice;
Nice, nice, very nice--
So many major-modes
In the same device.
</pre>

Nah, one day everything will rather be [[Anything]]
