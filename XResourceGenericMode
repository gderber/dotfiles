In your .Xdefaults or .Xresources files, put the following on the
first line of the file:

 ! -*- mode: x-resource-generic -*-

Then make sure that Emacs knows what x-resource-generic-mode actually does.  Add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

 (autoload 'x-resource-generic-mode "generic-x" nil t)

The power of GenericMode!
