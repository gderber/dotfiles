== Some markers for the work at hand ==

As a challange to myself on my journey of learning elisp, I
implemented something that I have not found so far. A way to quickly
set some markers (called bookmarks in some editors) in a buffer or
two. Probably temporary for the work at hand. Does not need to persist
between emacs sessions.

Emacs bookmarks and registers are excellent and featureful things for
saving locations to jump back to. Sometimes you just want to jump
around in the current buffer. For that, not many features are
required.

== Features ==

* Add a marker with `spin-marker-add' based on current position of
  point. Remove it with the same function prefixed with non-nil
  argument.

* Jump to the next marker with `spin-marker-jump-next'. Markers in
  buffers that no longer exist are automatically removed as you jump.

* That's it.

== Code ==

Get the lisp for this at Lisp:spin-markers.el. Put it in a location
that is also in your [[LoadPath]]. See the simple configuration
required in the commentary. Find some really quick key-bindings for
the two functions necessary.
