'''Emacs''' began at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at
MIT (See MeatBall:MitAiLab). Beginning in 1972, staff hacker CarlMikkelsen added
display-editing capability to '''[[TECO]]''', the text editor on the AI Lab's
IncompatibleTimeSharingSystem (ITS) "Display-editing" meant
that the screen display was updated as the user entered new commands;
compare the behavior of '''ed'''.  In 1974, RichardStallman added macro
features to the TECO editor.

The users at the AI Lab Large soon accumulated a collection of custom
macros, [[TECO]] programs that could be launched from within the display
editing mode. In 1976, Stallman wrote the first Emacs ("Editor
!MACroS"), which organized these macros into a single command
set and added facilities for SelfDocumentation and to be [[extensible]]. TecoEmacs soon
became the standard editor on ITS.

In January 1978, EugeneCiccarelli wrote an internal document for the MIT AI Lab, introducing the features of Emacs to users.
The title of the report was AnIntroductionToTheEmacsEditor.

Several Emacs-like editors were written in the following years, such
as '''[[EINE]]''' (__E__INE __I__s __N__ot __E__MACS) and '''[[ZWEI]]''' (__Z__WEI __W__as __E__INE __I__nitially),
written by Daniel Weinreb and Mike !McMahon.  ZWEI later became '''[[Zmacs]]'''.

In 1978, Bernard Greenberg wrote '''MulticsEmacs''' at Honeywell's Cambridge
Information Systems Lab. The editor was written in MacLisp, a dialect
of the LISP programming language. User-supplied extensions were also
written in Lisp. The choice of [[Lisp]] provided more extensibility than
ever before, and has been followed by most subsequent Emacsen.

'''Gosling Emacs''', the first Emacs to run on Unix, was written by
JamesGosling in 1981, based on the plans he and RichardStallman had developed for a new, widely portable Emacs. It was written in C, with MockLisp at the core of its functionality and as its
extension language.  Mock Lisp ''looked'' a bit like Lisp, but it was not really Lisp: it lacked true lists (it couldn't `cons'), and handling of function arguments was done in an error-prone, artificial way. For more info, see [[WikiPedia:Gosling Emacs]]).

In 1981, Stallman wrote a report on Emacs as an internal document of the MIT AI Lab.  The title of the report was
''EmacsTheExtensibleCustomizableSelfDocumentingDisplayEditor''.
He also gave a speech on his experiences, ''My Lisp Experiences and the Development of GNU Emacs'', 28 Oct 2002, at the International Lisp Conference.[http://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.html]

In 1984, Stallman began writing another Emacs implementation based on the former co-planning with Gosling, naming it '''GnuEmacs''', which became the first program in the nascent GNU project. See [[WikiPedia:GNU Emacs]] for an extensive history and description. Like with Gosling Emacs, GNU Emacs's core (user interface and Lisp engine) was written in C, while the engine's Lisp itself was used to write most parts of the editor's functionality and is used as integral extension language at the same time. Stallman's EmacsLisp derived directly from MacLisp, thus featured several improvements over MockLisp, and had new features specifically suited to editing text and source code. The first widely
distributed version of GNU Emacs was 15.34, which appeared in
1985. Like Gosling Emacs, GNU Emacs ran on Unix, but it had more
features and a more advanced extension language. It soon replaced
Gosling Emacs as the ''de facto'' Emacs editor on Unix.

Beginning in 1991, '''LucidEmacs''' was developed by JamieZawinski and
others at Lucid Inc., based on an early alpha version of GNU Emacs
19, adding a graphical X11 interface based on the Lucid widget set and introducing some changes to Emacs itself. The codebases (and the Lisp compatibility) between GNU and Lucid Emacsen soon diverged, and the separate development teams gave up trying to merge them back into a single program. Lucid Emacs
has later become an open-source project under the name '''[[XEmacs]]''', which, in its last version 21, has functionally become mostly superceded by GNU Emacs 22 and later versions (which now also featured an X11 interface), although there exists an actively maintained fork called '''[[SXemacs]]'''. To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw, GNU Emacs and XEmacs are two editors separated by a common language.

JamieZawinski drew up an Emacs timeline a couple of decades back.[http://www.jwz.org/doc/emacs-timeline.html]

For humor, see EmacsReleaseDates.

CraigFinseth has some interesting Emacs stuff on his web pages.  See
EmacsImplementations for a huge list of Emacs-like editors.

Beginning with version 21, GNU Emacs was able to display inline images, so
it was possible to display a splash image when
starting-up. For the story behind the creation of the GNU Emacs logo, see [http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/emacs/logo/]

There is also an [http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/embedded/#Emacs_Lisp_ Emacs Lisp section at the "History of Lisp" project page].

EmacsGrepAndUnix contains a detailed (30 page) description of Emacs's early years and the resulting politicization around free and proprietary software.

EmacsAtWorkPaper covers the history of GnuEmacs and dynamics of the FreeSoftware community.

[http://www.free-soft.org/gpl_history The History of the GPL] is also very much about the One True Editor.

: "Because programming and the world of computers moves so fast it's tempting to think of arguments about old versions of Emacs as ancient history. But the people who had those bitter arguments then are still important to us now. The relationships that were forged, or broke down are still having an impact.
: "As far as I can see the only thing that can be done about this is that we all consider the motivation and history when we consider these issues. That's normally a history student thing rather than a computer science student thing."

You can try an old emacs Version 165 online running on Tops-20 using "telnet twenex.org". (The help key is C-_, the info manual is installed C-_ i ). See http://www.twenex.org/ for more info about the system.
