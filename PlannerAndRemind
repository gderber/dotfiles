You can combine PlannerMode and the <code>remind</code> utility by using http://sachachua.com/notebook/emacs/remind.el. Please see remind.el for more details.

It would be interesting to combine Calendar, Planner and Remind in such a way that from CalendarMode someone could add appointments to .reminders

Another approach is to use http://sachachua.com/notebook/emacs/planner-diary.el to integrate your emacs diary entries with planner.  


<b>
DanielMartins .emacs+remind configuration
</b>



<pre>
;; ;; To include .reminders as a shell mode 
  (setq auto-mode-alist
        (cons '(".reminders$" . shell-script-mode) auto-mode-alist))

(add-hook 'sh-mode-hook
     (lambda ()
       (auto-fill-mode nil)))


;; From Sacha Chua

;; If you want your schedule to be automatically updated 
;; whenever you save a planner file, put this in your .emacs:

;; Remind options

(require 'remind)


(add-hook 'planner-mode-hook
   (lambda () (interactive)             
     (make-local-hook 'after-save-hook)
     (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'remind-parse-planner t t)
     (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'remind-export-to-diary t t)))

;; Alternatively, you can add the following lines to your
;; .emacs file:

(defadvice mark-diary-entries (before remind-generate-diary activate)
  "Generate a diary file from a .reminders file."
  (remind-parse-planner)
  (remind-export-to-diary))


</pre>
