Here is how to make C-h show help from within IncrementalSearch:

    (define-key isearch-mode-map [(control h)] 'isearch-mode-help)

And if you want to read the help too you can allow scrolling by setting isearch-allow-scroll.

Other than that, use C-h f isearch-mode...

Or `C-h k C-s'...

Library Lisp:isearch+.el makes this binding, but it also redefines `isearch-mode-help' so that it:

* Lists ''all'' of the isearch bindings.
* ''Ends'' isearch -- it does `isearch-done' and `isearch-clean-overlays'.
