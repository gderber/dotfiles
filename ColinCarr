Write a few words about your relationship to Emacs: I have a very string relationship with Emacs start around 1987.

I use GNU Emacs as it is the One True Emacsâ„¢

* init file: https://github.com/colincarr/home/blob/master/.emacs
I am going to start cleaning this up and this is actually a "clean" one and my current in a portfolio of .emacs files.
Right now I use so many systems and I need to change the character of this as I would like to have packages automated.
jwiegley has an interesting macro that I will leverage to organize this and future .emacs

* ~/.gnus: 
This one I am holding because I am off gnus for a while but I want to clean that up too.
