I'm a Emacs newbie, started using Emacs since late of 2009.

Although a Chinese guy, fortunately the first version of Emacs that I used in GNU Emacs 23.1, which supports unicode and xft. Thus I was not bothered with those problems relating to fonts and charsets described in many Chinese articles by other guyes.

* [http://www.cnblogs.com/bamanzi/archive/2011/03/07/emacs-auto-complete-scite-api.html auto-complete-scite-api] - auto-completion source with scite API files  (please read the [https://bitbucket.org/bamanzi/dotemacs-full/src/default/lisp/auto-complete-scite-api.el?at=default source code] for English introduction.)
* [https://bitbucket.org/bamanzi/dotemacs-full/src/default/lisp/delphi-ext.el?at=default delphi-ext.el] improves pascal-mode to make it support object pascal & delphi better: highlighting object pascal keywords, imenu support for object pascal class and new commands to jump between function/method declartion and implementation

Based on code stolen from [http://www.mygooglest.com/fni/dot-emacs.html FabriceNiessen's dotemacs file].)  Refer [https://bitbucket.org/bamanzi/dotemacs-full/src/default/lisp/outline-org-like.el?at=default source code file] for English instructions.
* [https://bitbucket.org/bamanzi/dotemacs-full/src/default/lisp/mark-copy-something.el?at=default mark-copy-something.el] is a quick-and-dirty package to mark/copy something. It was written in early days in my emacs history, at that time I don't know about thing-at-point. Maybe someday I'll rewrite it.
