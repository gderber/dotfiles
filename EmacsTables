It would be nice if Emacs was better at rendering tables.

* TableMode -- ASCII art tables with flowing text
* OrgMode -- comes with a built-in table editing mode that can be used stand-alone
* [[ESS]] -- if you're interested in tables as in spreadsheet stuff with formulas and all that

== HTML Tables ==

An example is w3m rendering html. There is no "rowspan" feature for emacs images, so 
text flow gets broken when a large image comes along.

There is a nice new rendererer in Gnus, shr.el.

TODO describe hacks and posible display engine modifications
