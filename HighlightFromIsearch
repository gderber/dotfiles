Assume you're using `C-s' to run IncrementalSearch, and you want to keep all your matches highlighted after searching. There are at least two ways to do this:

* Customize option `lazy-highlight-cleanup' to `nil'. When you end Isearch, its normal highlighting remains. You can later remove this highlighting using command `lazy-highlight-cleanup'.

* Use the code below to highlight your Isearch hits only on demand, when you hit a particular key (e.g. `C-TAB') during Isearch. You can remove this highlighting using `C-x w r' (`unhighlight-regexp').  This uses command `highlight-phrase' from HiLock -- see HighlightTemporarily.


      (defun isearch-highlight-phrase ()
        "Invoke `highligh-phrase' from within isearch."
        (interactive)
        (let ((case-fold-search isearch-case-fold-search))
          (highlight-phrase (if isearch-regexp
                                isearch-string
                              (regexp-quote isearch-string)))))

      (define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "C-<tab>") 'isearch-highlight-phrase)
