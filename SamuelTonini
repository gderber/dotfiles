I am [http://samueltonini.com/ samueltonini], a software developer and dance teacher.

These days I have been coding heavily with Elixir, Emacs Lisp, Ruby and JavaScript.

Since a [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/senny friend] introduced me to Emacs, I use Emacs every day all the time for everything.

== My Emacs configuration ==
After using a prefabricated emacs setup for a long time, I came to the point where I wanted to build together my own custom emacs stack.

Have a look at my [https://github.com/tonini/emacs.d config].

You can find me on [https://github.com/tonini github] or have a look at my [https://twitter.com/samueltonini tweets] to follow my daily grind.
