 erobot.el --- game with elisp functions trying to survive

You can get the source code here:

* Lisp:erobot.el

This game implements a very basic version of the many robot variants
out there: Players write little programs (robots) that compete in a
simulated arena.

This variant of the game is called eRobot because the robots are
implemented in EmacsLisp for Emacs.  Players compete by writing a
defun (called a candidate or am erobot).  The last erobot remaining
wins the game.

Here is a sample candidate:

 (defun erobot-candidate-wanderer ()
   "A possible candidate for a game of `erobot'.
 This candidate moves around in random directions."
   (list 'erobot-move (erobot-random-dir)))

See the `erobot' doc-string for a list of useful functions to use.
These are the "sensors" of the robot.

The variable `erobot-commands' list the commands the robot may choose to eventually /do/.
These are the "motors" of the robot.
You can read the doc-string of every command in the list.

Well, there are only two at the moment, `erobot-move' with a direction (the symbol up, right, down, or left),
and `erobot-pass'.  ;)

==Installation==

In order to install, put the file somewhere on your
`load-path' and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

 (autoload 'erobot "erobot" "Robots for Emacs, a game." t)

Calling erobot will prompt you for two candidates and run a game for
you.

==Teams==

Instead of fighting one against all, you can also have teams:

 (defalias 'chaser-1 'erobot-candidate-chaser)
 (defalias 'chaser-2 'erobot-candidate-chaser)
 (defalias 'chaser-3 'erobot-candidate-chaser)
 (erobot 'erobot-candidate-wicked-walker '(chaser-1 chaser-2 chaser-3))

==Tournaments==

You can run the same game as a tournament:

 (erobot-run-tournament 'erobot-best-of-5
                        'erobot-candidate-wicked-walker
                        '(chaser-1 chaser-2 chaser-3))

Tournament result:

 TOURNAMENT: BEST-OF-5

 Score  Candidate

     3  chaser-2
     2  chaser-3
     1  erobot-candidate-wicked-walker
     1  chaser-1

 Score  Team

     6  (chaser-1 chaser-2 chaser-3)
