[[fr: ThumbsModeFrancais]]

Make Emacs your choice of image viewer!

Use the 'convert' program from <nowiki>ImageMagick</nowiki> [http://www.imagemagick.org/] to:

* Create preview pages with thumbnails.(see screenshot below)
* View an image and zoom with the '+' and '-' keys. 
* Interface with the 'convert' program to modify an image (emboss, swirl e.t.c)
* Set your desktop wallpaper (via the xloadimage program)
* You can use ThumbsMode to post to [http://www.flickr.com/ flickr]; see FlickrClient.

The thumbs page at Savannah at: http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/thumbs/ will no longer be maintained as GIT:thumbs.el will be part of emacs.

The more recent version can be found on the ElispArea as Lisp:thumbs.el

[http://www.bookshelf.jp/cgi-bin/goto.cgi?file=meadow&node=thumbs Information about thumbs.el in japanese]

Also see [[Tumme]] which is more actively developed, provide approximately the same functionality (and more) and comes with Emacs 22.

----
Xemacs version: Lisp:thumbs-xmas.el

*NOTE*: The more recent version of thumbs in it's xemacs version
exist but have not been tested.  I dont want to maintain it.
If you are volunteer to do so, please tell me.

== What's New? ==

* support for customize have been added
* A lot of bugs have been fixed
* xemacs support have been removed :-(

== Configuration ==


In your ~/.emacs file:

    (autoload 'thumbs "thumbs" "Preview images in a directory." t)

Then:

    M-x thumbs

will prompt you for a directory name (defaulting to the current one).

In dired, C-t m will pop a thumbs directory with the marked files.

== Screenshots ==

== See Also ==

* For another, slightly different way of browsing your images as thumbnails, see [[Tumme]].

* For a different kind of thumbnail -- active thumbnail Emacs ''frames'' (not images), see FisheyeWithThumbs. You can use these frames to monitor buffers at thumbnail size.


== Wish List and To-Do List ==

* Make it work with tramp mode for remote connections
* add your features request here!

I had to make a change to get this to work on Windows.  The function thumbs-thumbname tried to make a filename that looked like 'c:pathtofilethenfilename' which didnt' work.  I changed it to the following and it worked great. -- RyanBowman

    (defun thumbs-thumbname (img)
      "Return a thumbnail name for the image IMG."
      (concat thumbs-thumbsdir "/"
	      (thumbs-subst-char-in-string
	       ?\  ?\_
	       (apply
	        'concat
	        (split-string
	         (expand-file-name img) "[:/]"))))) ;; changed "/" to "[:/]"

I tried an alternate change after running into and debugging the same problem (should have looked here first!). -- RobDavenport

    (defun thumbs-thumbname (img)
      "Return a thumbnail name for the image IMG."
      (concat thumbs-thumbsdir "/"
	      (thumbs-subst-char-in-string
	       ?\  ?\_
	       (apply
	        'concat
	        (split-string
                 (file-relative-name (expand-file-name img)) "/")))))

Ryan's is probably the better solution.
