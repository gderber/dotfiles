Is any of this still applicable for GNU Emacs 25+ running on Windows now (2018)?  According to http://bamanzi.github.io/scrapbook/data/20110925164421/fonts-and-text-translation.html : "For many languages, native truetype fonts are sufficient, and in Emacs 23 the need for BDF fonts will disappear for almost all languages" and we're well past Emacs 23.  I would at least recommend a note at the top of the page stating "this page is applicable to Emacs versions before Emacs 23" or something similar.

I agree. Will you do it? All of this is probably no longer useful. Perhaps we should simply delete it?

People have complained about the outdated information on the wiki in the past. Thereâ€™s basically two models to run it: keep everything and we will end up with layers upon layers of history, which is fine by me, or clean up aggressively and keep it as current as we can (definitely struggling at that). Which would you prefer?
