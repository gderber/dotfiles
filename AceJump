AceJump-mode is a minor mode for Emacs, enabling fast/direct cursor movement in current view.

[:WantDemo]
= Is there a demo? =
Yes, refer to [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3254819/AceJumpModeDemo/AceJumpDemo.htm here].

There is also an Emacs Rocks [http://emacsrocks.com/e10.html screencast for AceJump]. 

[:WhereItComesFrom]
= Where does this minor mode come from? =
I first saw this kind of movement style is in a vim plugin called !EasyMotion. It was really attractive. !EasyMotion provides a much simpler way to use some motions in vim. It takes the <number> out of <number>w or <number>f{char} by highlighting all possible choices and allowing you to press one key to jump directly to the target. So I decided to write a similar mode for Emacs.

So I must thank:

  Bartlomiej P.    for his PreciseJump

  Kim SilkebÃ¦kken  for his EasyMotion


[:WhatIsAceJumpMode]
= What's ace-jump-mode? =
ace-jump-mode is an fast/direct cursor location minor mode. It will create the N-Branch search tree internal
and marks all the possible position with predefined keys in current view. Allowing you to move to the 
character/word/line almost directly.

[:WhatDoYouImplement]
= What is implemented now ? =
I have not implemented everything from !EasyMotion. Because I want to make it as simple as possible, you don't 
need to spend more than 2 minutes to learn how to use it. Right now, there are only three commands, which can 
help you to quick move to a specific character, word and (non-empty) line. Enjoy it!

Of course, if you have any cool suggestions, feel free to tell me at anytime and I will put them to top of my TODO list :D

[:HowToInstall]
= How do I install it? =
Add the following code to your init file, assigning whatever keys you prefer.

    (add-to-list 'load-path "which-folder-ace-jump-mode-file-in/")
    (require 'ace-jump-mode)
    (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c SPC") 'ace-jump-mode)
    
    ;;If you also use viper mode:
    (define-key viper-vi-global-user-map (kbd "SPC") 'ace-jump-mode)


For more details, see the help of `ace-jump-mode'.

[:HowToUseIt]
= How do I use it? =
If you use the default configuration, which binds to "C-c SPC".

* "C-c SPC" ==>  ace-jump-word-mode

  enter first char of a word, select the highlight key to move to.

* "C-u C-c SPC" ==>  ace-jump-char-mode

  enter a char for query, select the highlight key to move to.

* "C-u C-u C-c SPC" ==>  ace-jump-line-mode

  each non-empty line will be marked, select the highlight key to move to.
