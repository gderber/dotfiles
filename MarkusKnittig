Hello

My name is Markus Knittig. I'm a german software engineering student of the University of Stuttgart.

I use Emacs for editing files, mail and news and much more.

My todo list for the EmacsWiki:

* extend gnus buffers entry (write something about GroupBuffer, ServerBuffer and WindowLayout)
* write something about WanderLust (Get starting and so on)
* fix sb-emacswiki.el in WThreeMShimbun (done by DavidHansen)
* extend CategoryMail und CategoryMailAddons
* extend TinyTools

Thanks ''again'' for all your efforts! -- AlexSchroeder
