yod.el is a client for the Yahoo! Messenger chat protocol (YMSG 12). It is written in emacs lisp (with a little help from C), and supports chatrooms, instant messages, and conferences.

Since I started working on yod.el, Yahoo! has changed their encryption scheme
at least twice. To handle those changes easily, yod.el uses a small C program
(called "ycrypt") to do password encyrption. The C source comes from whatever
other open source Yahoo client cracks the password change first.

Most of the problems people have reported with yod.el are due to a
misconfigured setting for ycrypt. It looks to me like that
ClairChing 's problem too.

One of the yod.el customization options is 'yodel-crypt-program -- the value of
that option should be set to the path of your ycrypt program.
