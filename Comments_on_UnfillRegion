The nXhtml sources appear to be unavailable.  Certainly they are not available right now at the given URL, as I received a no-permission error.  It seems that ourcomments.org is vestigial.

Perhaps the elisp that included the unfill- functions is available somewhere else?

I decided to remove the reference to nXhtml instead. I'm guessing NxmlMode does what nXhtml might have done, generally speaking.
