The server experienced a filesystem crash (XFS).
Several files were damaged.  I'm trying to restore corrupt files from a backup.
Goes to show how imported the occasional WikiDownload is.  :)
Anyway, I locked the site while I work on it.

Time passes...

Done.
Not all pages had usable backups, however:

EdgarGon√ßalves
EmacsOnAIX
JessRobinson
JamesMastros
LispLispLisp
SubEthaEmacs
SubEthaEditProtocol

If you have a copy of these files somewhere, please help to recreate them.
I've tried to recover these pages from older revisions where available.
