== How to jump between windows.==

Lisp:window-number.el

Just drop that into your load-path and place the following into your .emacs:

    (require 'window-number)
    (window-number-mode)

If you like to use the meta key instead of the `C-x C-j' prefix, add the following:

    (window-number-meta-mode)
