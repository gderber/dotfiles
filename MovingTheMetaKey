By default, My Microsoft Natural Keyboard mapped the Meta key to the Windows button and not to the Alt button.
To fix this, run XKeyCaps and load up a keyboard that matches your keyboard.  Write down the number on the key you
want to be your Meta key (0x40 in my case).  Then add the following line to your ~/.xmodmap:

keycode 0x40 = Meta_L

and run: xmodmap -e 'keycode 0x40 = Meta_L'

Or, just try XKeyCaps for a much friendlier interface to moving keys around. 

Now your Alt key should properly generate a Meta event, and your Windows key is free to map to the start menu! ;-)

this .reg is supposed to make caps=ctrl and win=alt but i've never tried it:
