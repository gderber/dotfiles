The GTK-Toolkit changed it's default file chooser dialog to a new interface which seen rather controversial.  It is not a rudimentary as it looks, though.

== Important Bindings ==

; C-l : Open a location bar which uses completion and is generally helpful.
; / : Open the location bar at the root directory (just as in Emacs :-)
; ~ : Open the location bar at your home directory (again, just as in Emacs :-)
; M-up/down : Up or down one directory (down to a previously visited directory, not the selected item in the list).
; M-home : Jump to your home directory
; M-d : Jump to your desktop directory (e.g. ~/Desktop)
; M-1..0 : Jump to one of the [[bookmark]]s

And there is a right mouse context menu which let's you toggle the visibility of hidden files.

== Customizing == 

If you want to use the old file dialog set

 (setq x-gtk-use-old-file-dialog t)

See also the variable `x-gtk-show-hidden-files'
