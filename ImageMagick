== About ImageMagick ==

: ''ImageMagick (TM), version 6.2.2, is a free software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images. It can read, convert and write images in a large variety of formats. Images can be cropped, colors can be changed, various effects can be applied, images can be rotated and combined, and text, lines, polygons, ellipses and BÃ©zier curves can be added to images and stretched and rotated.''

== Emacs modes ==

Here's some Emacs things to let you harness ImageMagick,

* ImageMode -- view files as images
* EmacsImageManipulation -- manipulate images
* ThumbsMode -- browse and manipulate images
* ImageDired -- creates thumbnails with imagemagick

== Using with Windows ==

Emacs needs to be compiled with ImageMagick support in order to take advantage of certain features, eg resizing images in ImageMode. 

== GraphicsMagick ==

Some things I found while looking for a W32 version:

/GraphicsMagick is originally derived from ImageMagick 5.5.2/

: ftp://ftp.graphicsmagick.org/pub/GraphicsMagick/windows

/The author of sam2p recommends his program over ImageMagick:/

:: I tried it and it is true that it is faster than ImageMagick for certain operations. It also seems to create smaller file sizes. Thanks to you, I had to add possibilities to customize which tool to use in [[Tumme]], Grrrr! ... :) The [http://www.graphicsmagick.org/www/Copyright.html License] seems a bit complicated though... -- MaDa

== Djvu File Support ==

I'm working on a patch to be able to use imagemagick to load for instance .djvu files in emacs. See emacs-devel mailing list for the patch --JoakimVerona
: For now, I find using djvups to create a postscript file and viewing that using doc-view very satisfactory (whereas working with tiffs or pdfs created using ddjvu was not). The quality is great and so is the speed at which you can flip through the pages. -- pipping
