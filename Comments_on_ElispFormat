I am very interested in learning the proper lisp style formatting. Has anybody with elisp experience tried ElispFormat? I would like to use it to learn more. I have found it from this: http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/5c3ad44be794ebec -- priyadarshan

I recall trying it and not liking what it did always to Emacs Lisp code.

Emacs already comes with an indent region command for EmacsLispMode and there is already a CheckDoc minor mode.  The only way to improve the style of your Lisp code is to read a lot of existing Lisp code.  Emacs comes with a lot of source code, of varying qualities, so you can read it.

ElispFormat is a solution in search of a problem.  When I found out it was a contract job paid someone it became clear that I was right.

Thank you. Is there a section on this wiki where one can submit code for advice, style-wise as well?

I searched the web, but I could not find at least some guidelines for generic lisp code (beside styling comments). Do you have any page you could advice?

By the way, I really like your [[Reference Sheet by Aaron Hawley]]. It is so useful, thank you for that.

You could hang out in the EmacsChannel and share your code with the [http://paste.lisp.org/list/emacs LispPaste] service.

Yes, that's a good page.

It reminds me of [[Riastradh]]'s Scheme style guide which is also very good.

Thank you for that page. Very helpful!

It reminded me of a very good book I used to own, Lisp: Style and Design by M. Miller and E. Benson

I looked to see how much a used copy costs nowadays (http://www.amazon.com/Lisp-Design-Molly-M-Miller/dp/1555580440) Impossibly expensive!
