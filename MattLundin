I am an academic who uses emacs, OrgMode, and AUCTeX for all of my planning, note taking, and writing needs.

I am most grateful to all those who have worked on the wonderful computing ecosystem that is emacs.

Here's a tutorial I wrote on [[OrgMode]]'s custom agenda commands:

(By the way, though I use [[http://www.pmwiki.org|PmWiki]] because of server compatibility, I am a big fan of [[http://www.oddmuse.org/cgi-bin/oddmuse|Oddmuse]] and the work that AlexSchroeder has done with it.)

A belated welcome to the wiki! :) I must have missed you back when you

Thanks for the welcome. I toyed with a thinly veiled anonymity but
then thought better of it. MattLundin
