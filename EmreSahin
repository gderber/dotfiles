Emre Şahin from Ankara, Turkey. (Ş = S with cedilla is pronunced like sh in Turkish.)

About 3 years of Emacs, using it for almost everything, including w3m. (That captcha thing does not permit to edit EmacsWiki pages with w3m by the way, at least in console.)

I use Emacs in Debian Linux and rarely in Windows. 

My website (which is mostly Turkish) is http://emresahin.net
