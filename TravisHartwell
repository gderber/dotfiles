My name is Travis Hartwell (I hang out on IRC as [::Nafai] -- see me on #emacs!) and I have been using Gnu Emacs for roughly 3 years now and realize each day that I don't know near enough about this.  I started using Emacs due to a few reasons:  A professor at my university gave a workshop for our university's LUG about beginning Emacs usage.  Around the same time I started using Python and I had some odd problems with vim and combining tabs and spaces that caused some syntax errors.  I switched to Emacs and haven't looked back.  I have a fairly customized setup and I will later add stories here about how I use Emacs similar to what SachaChua has done.  Most of my customization and use ideas have come from many of the Emacs gurus that I know, such as JohnWiegley and DamienElmes.  

Currently, I use Emacs for:
* development in C, C++, Lisp, and Python
* GNUS for e-mail and news
* note taking in class on my laptop
* journal writing and other miscellaneous writing, often using EmacsWikiMode
* Keeping a schedule using CalendarMode and DiaryMode

Admittedly, I use vim for a lot of the remote sys-admin tasks I do for work.  Because of my increased proficiency in this I have become interested in Viper-Mode in Emacs but haven't had time to learn it. 

I wish to also here:
* Make a list of things I wish to do in my current Emacs setup
