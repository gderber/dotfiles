 What is the most appropriate object for the daily sacrifice to emacs ?
 
 I would have used my vim  but I deleted it a long time ago....
 There are no vi users around either...

 Emacs is not built by hate of vi.  vi is irrelevant.  It is no more than
 a strange punishment that the unbelievers submit themselves to.
 
 To truly worship thy Emacs, one must come to it with Love: Love for The
 Extensible One, Love for The Customizable One, and finally, Love for The
 Self-Documenting One.  To serve Emacs one does not do things of hate,
 but of love.  One reads from the Great Book of Elisp, and uses this
 knowledge to Extend and Expand Emacs.  One learns a new function
 from that Great Book, and customizes his .emacs to refer to it and ease
 its use.  One reads through the Manuals and if one comes upon a patch of
 text that has not been well kept, one cleans the weeds of it, waters the
 instructions and sends the patch to The Maintainers.  
 
 And in this way, one serves The One True Emacs.
