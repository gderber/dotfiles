== pdftools: "printing" to pdf ==

Sometimes ps-spool-(buffer|region)-(with-faces)? (hereafter,
"ps-spool-X") isn't enough.  Sometimes, the MS-DOS user doesn't know
what to do with a text file and wants a pdf.  This is for those times.


== requirements ==

Makes a system call to "ps2pdf" so it probably won't work under MS-DOS and descendents.  I should make the system-called-command a customizable variable, but that will have to wait until the next time I'm on a long flight.

For those in the thrall of Redmond, WA, there is MathiasDahl's
PostScriptToPDF.

== customization ==

These functions call ps-spool-X, so use the "ps" customization group
to tweak output.

== usage ==
One major difference from ps-spool-X is that pdf-save-X asks for a
filename in which to save the output.  If you don't give one, it uses
the buffer name in the current directory with ".pdf" appended.

Use the C-u prefix if you don't want the output to open up over your
present buffer.
