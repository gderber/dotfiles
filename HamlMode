Haml does have an emacs plugin.

Note that as HAML uses spaces only for indentation make sure you turn off tabs, also you can enable auto-indent mode.

     (add-hook 'haml-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (setq indent-tabs-mode nil)
                 (define-key haml-mode-map "\C-m" 'newline-and-indent)))
