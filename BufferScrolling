A common complaint by Emacs newbies is that it doesn't scroll like
they are used to.  Most notable is scrolling down one line at a time,
also known as the NextLineBehavior.

Another common issue is horizontal scrolling and line wrapping.  Line
wrapping can be disabled with:

    (setq truncate-lines t)

or M-x toggle-truncate-lines

In Emacs versions before 21, you also need this:

    (hscroll-global-mode 1)
