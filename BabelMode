BabelMode provides an Emacs interface to different translation
services available on the Internet. You give it a word or paragraph
to translate and select the source and destination languages, and
it connects to the translation server, retrieves the data, and
presents it in a special *babel* buffer. Currently the following
backends are available:

* the Babelfish service at babelfish.yahoo.com                              
* the Google service at translate.google.com                                
* the Apertium FOSS MT service, see http://apertium.org
* the Transparent Language motor at FreeTranslation.com    

BabelMode requires the (X)Emacs editor. It is written originally by EricMarsden and is now maintained by Jürgen Hötzel. the file can be download here :
