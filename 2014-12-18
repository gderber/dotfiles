We're moving to a new server. I've disabled editing for the moment. Administrators can still edit pages but their changes will be lost.
Once we're done, there is an additional delay as you will need to wait for the DNS changes to propagate. Sometime withing the next 24h
you should be redirected to the new server and editing will be enabled again.

Success! You are on the new server.
Please let me know if you find anything not working as it should.
Send [mailto:kensanata@gmail.com mail] or contact me [EmacsChannel on IRC].

I'm currently going through things like the ElispArea, cron jobs, and all that.

Happy editing. :)

The extraordinary load the new server had to take (the wiki being a simple CGI script) was a load to bearâ€¦
It took my a bit but I think the basics are up again, this time using !FastCGI ([http://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/mod/mod_fcgid.html mod_fcgid]).
We'll see how far this goes.

This is now [http://www.edis.at/de/server/linux-vps-solusvm-openvz/schweiz/ovz-advanced/ an openvz solution with two cores and 2G RAM].

This entire !FastCGI thing is very new to me. I've looked at it a few years ago, but never used it for one of my sites.
Well, load around 198 does this to you. ;)

I've configured Apache using the following parameters:

{{{
FcgidMaxProcesses 20
FcgidProcessLifeTime 300
FcgidMaxRequestsPerProcess 100
}}}

For the curious, the setup is [http://oddmuse.org/wiki/Using_mod_fastcgi#h5o-5 documented on the Oddmuse wiki].

Currently, language-specific invocations (emacs-de, emacs-zh and the like still use the CGI interface. People don't seem to be using these so much, so that's good.
I might end up getting rid of those, eventually. :)
