== PL/1 mode ==
[new]
I am looking for a pl/1 mode for emacs; I know there was one on MACemacs under MULTICS.

Is this mode still anywhere available? And, who knows PL/1 well enough to write such a mode if it's lost?

Kind regards,

Ralf Hagen (needing PL/M for a Z80-CP/M-project)

== Laptop hibernation on IRC ==
I am just beginning to use screen and I launch GNU Emacs through it. When I am on IRC and I hibernate my laptop, resuming the laptop leads to this:

Even if I doM-x rcirc and choose the same IRC server, it claims it can't find it :(

If I start a fresh GNU Emacs session, that perfectly works. Do you know why it won't work in a resumed session ?
