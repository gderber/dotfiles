Pacman mode makes the Archlinux package manager, pacman, available from Emacs.

* https://github.com/bbetances/conf-scripts/blob/master/emacs-dir/custom-modes/pacman.el

wget that file, or clone the base repo, put it in your .emacs.d, and require it in .emacs

Once loaded, M-x pacman-mode to start it. The keybindings are all listed in the main buffer.
