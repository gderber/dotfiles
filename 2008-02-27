Hey, I missed this one! RMS says: "Stefan and Yidong offered to take over, so I am willing to hand over Emacs development to them." (2008-02-22)
The [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/67296 entire thread] started last year.

RMS said this was the fourth time he was no longer the maintainer.
Phew, I firstly thought he retired.
