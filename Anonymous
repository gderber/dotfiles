Anonymous, [::Anon], or [::anon], is the pseudonym of any number of
individuals who, rather than provide a UserName, wish not to identify themselves when they edit pages.  Note, that network **IP addresses never remain anonymous** on EmacsWiki. The page history will provide the IP number or hostname as a popup if you let the mouse hover over the username, for example. If you want to keep it a secret, you need to use a network anonymizer like TheOnionRouter (Tor).

Using "Anonymous" as a UserName is a behavior that is not frowned upon, since the Wiki:WikiEngine doesn't require logins ("MeatBall:SoftSecurity") and all edits should be reviewed regardless of personal credentials.  Users signing their edits as "Anonymous" are still encouraged to start a UserName homepage to introduce themselves as an Emacs user and Wiki editor.
