After consuming the wiki for the last few months, I finally added something to the conversation.

Argentinian, living in the US. 
Windows user, .NET programmer. Converted to JavaScripter. Then converted to Pythonista. Moved to Linux at home. 
Researched my options for ditching Visual Studio and settled on Emacs, which I fell in love with after two weeks of learning.
