== INKMACS ==

Inkmacs integrates Inkscape and Emacs.

It is experimental but if you are prepared for some tedious setup 
the main attractive feature is actually quite usable now.

It is possible to synchronize text nodes in inkscape with an org mode tree in emacs!


Inkmacs code is here: https://github.com/jave/inkmacs

Below is a very simple example image, which is included in the source repository.

Ink-org = In-korg = Inkorg? :) -- MaDa (non-Swedes, just ignore this)

Yes MaDa, that's it :) Funny that someone should notice the joke! --JoakimVerona
