If you have trouble editing the wiki because of an overly eager spam protection, let me know.
I'm using BannedRegexps to experiment with various regular expressions that are supposed to stop spammers.
One regular expression I recently tried prevented people from having three or more bare URLs on a page or in a comment.
It turns out that there are a lot of existing pages on this wiki with bare URLs!
Since this lead to some complaints, I commented the rule (it's still on BannedRegexps).
The following night, we were hit by a lot of spammers again.
Right now I'm experimenting with a different regular epression: I want to ban two consecutive URLs on a page or in a comment.

Let me know if any of the various banning mechanisms cause you trouble (the misnamed BannedContent, BannedHosts and BannedRegexps).

And, as always, you can see the result for yourself in the spammer log file: ##http://emacswiki.org/emacs/spammer.log##
