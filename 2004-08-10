A few days ago I added the [[Oddmuse:Portraits Support Extension]].
The most obvious change is that you can use '''<nowiki>[new]</nowiki>'''
to alternate the background color.
I think that is easier to read than indenting them with :, ::, or :::, etc.

See?

I hope it looks ok in text browsers, too.

...and I seem to be the first one to really use the "portrait-part" of the functionality... :)

Argh!
I added some stuff to the default CSS.
I hope it looks ok, now.
On Community Wiki I suggested people use image size 48x48 -- ordinary GnusFace size!

Ah! I set the width to 48 in Gimp but forgot that the height became more. Will fix!
