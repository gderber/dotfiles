If you are writing code that will eventually end up in a GNU project
such as GnuEmacs, then you will have to worry about legal matters: You
will need to sign a copyright assignment to the FSF.  The FSF then has
the copyright over your work.  This is different from releasing code
under the GPL.  You can always release code under the GPL without
assigning the copyright to the FSF.  The only effect this will have is
that your code cannot be part of GnuEmacs.  It can be part of XEmacs
([[XEmacs]]), however.

If you are writing a patch to code that is part of a GNU project such
as GnuEmacs, then you will have to assign the copyright as well, if
your patch is "significant".  For the GNU project, any patch spanning
more than 10 lines is considered "significant".
