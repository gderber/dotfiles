I guess we have an angry John or Jimmy somewhere in this world who's trying to delete Emacs Wiki or something like that.
The *site is locked*, for now.

And I reverted the changes made, of course.

Feel free to contact me via [mailto:kensanata@gmail.com mail] or on IRC. I'm in #emacs on Freenode.

And on and on... If you're interested, visit [[RecentChanges|Recent Changes]] and click on the [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rc;days=3;all=0;rollback=1;showedit=0 Include rollbacks] link.

Unlocking the site again. Let's see whether the idiots are still at it. -- Alex
