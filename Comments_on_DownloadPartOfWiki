@Alex Is it really still necessary to block wget? I intend to merge the various WikiDownload pages (as you suggest a long time ago) and the instructions on how to use wget are a bit complicated due to the restriction. Given that there is now a git repository (as well as svn, cvs) as well as a rsync mirror I doubt anybody would download the complete wiki using wget.

You are right. In addition to that, people still used wget with a slightly different User Agent string:

{{{
grep -i wget logs/access.log.1 | wc -l
4802
grep -i wget logs/access.log.1 | head -1
111.191.137.201 - - [23/Mar/2012:06:34:31 +0100] "HEAD / HTTP/1.1" 200 - "-" "Wget/1.13.4 (cygwin)"
}}}

Oh well!
