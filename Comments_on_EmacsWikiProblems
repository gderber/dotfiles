How long should resolved issues stay on the main page? Always? For a while? Move it to "EmacsWikiProblemsSolved" or to this Comments/Talk page?

My preference would be to delete them once they are resolved.
I don't think we need to archive them.
I try to delete stuff that's obviously resolved or no longer applicable, but I find it difficult to delete things I'm unsure of. It feels disrespectful to delete stuff because I don't understand or can't reproduce the problem.

I agree -- resolved problems can just be deleted.
