I want edit page http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=browse;diff=2;id=WikiModes

Can anyone help me add "(See also [[Yaoddmuse]])" after "ãƒ» OddmuseMode ? tailored to Oddmuse wikis and using curl to download and post pages"?
Make user can easy to find page "http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs/Yaoddmuse".

Thanks!           -- AndyStewart

Ah, I get it. That page was locked. I unlocked it. I don't remember why we had to lock it. Probably because of spammers. -- AlexSchroeder
