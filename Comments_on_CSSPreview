Thanks! It's still a bit experimental - I just noticed some fonts are a bit small, and the logo is just a placeholder, but any suggestions are welcome.

Also, I'm not sure yet what a good equivalent for Constantia is on Linux/Mac - a sans serif font might work also. I'll keep experimenting with it.
