I'm an embedded firmware developer who has been using Emacs since 1983.  Thought it was about time I started giving back.

I'm currently using emacs on windows, but occasionally use it on Sun OS as well.  My primary use is for C/C++, Java and various scripting languages.

I recently wrote a major mode for Procomm Aspect scripts at Lisp:procomm-mode.el.

__My .emacs file(s)__

I keep my .emacs file in a SVN repository on Assembla here:
: http://www.assembla.com/code/emacs_osnibore/subversion/nodes/trunk/.emacs

My .emacs is basically a launching platform for a bunch of task-specific customization files that are conditionally loaded based on where I am using Emacs (home, work, Unix).  The customization files that actually do the work are located in a "dotemacs" folder:
: http://www.assembla.com/code/emacs_osnibore/subversion/nodes/trunk/site/dotemacs

You can see my entire usr/home (including all of the support packages) here:
