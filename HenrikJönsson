I like emacs.

I have used [[XEmacs]] since 1993 and I feel quite comfortable with it.
I try to convince my colleagues that they can use XEmacs for everything.

I am still a lisp newbie, but I have written a minor mode for CmSynergy.

After almost ten years of [[XEmacs]] I have switched to GNU Emacs. I like it...
