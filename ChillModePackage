This page describes package Lisp:chill-modee.el, by ViniciusJoseLatorre.

: .:: ''v3.1'' ::.

*Warning:* This is a very old package.


== Introduction ==

ChillModePackage facilitates editing of CHILL code by automatically expanding
syntax constructs and handling the indentation of lines of code.  Besides a few
ideas of our own we tried to stay as close as possible to the philosophy of
cc-mode.  Please, refer to the GNU Emacs manual, /Editing Programs/ chapter.

ChillModePackage is based on CCITT Z.200/92 recommendation (COM X-R 34-E).

ChillModePackage was tested on GNU Emacs 19.33.1, 19.34.1 and 20.3.1, there is
no warranty that will run properly on older version or on other Emacs variants
(XEmacs, or any other).


== Installation ==

To use ChillModePackage, add the following to your ##~/.emacs## file:

   (autoload 'chill-mode "chill-mode" "CHILL Editing Mode" t)
   (setq auto-mode-alist
         (append '(("\\.chl$" . chill-mode) ; CHILL program source
                   ("\\.spc$" . chill-mode)) ; CHILL specification source
                  auto-mode-alist))

You may want to customize certain ChillModePackage variables (e.g. for
controlling the indentation).  The best place to do this is in the mode hook
variable called `chill-mode-hooks'.  See the Emacs manual (/Editing Programs/
chapter) and the ChillModePackage's documentation for more information.

It is recommended to compile ChillModePackage, because it is used a lot of
macros on sentence indentation, forward sentence and backward sentence.


== Syntax Structure Expansion ==

The syntax structure expansion is made when user type an upper case keyword
(for example: ##IF##) followed by a punctuation (space, tab, newline,
##=##, ##<##, etc.), for example:

: 1) type ##"IF "##

: 2) the following expansion is made:
:: ##IF  THEN##
:: ##FI;##
: cursor is positioned between strings ##"IF "## and ##" THEN"##

If user type ##"if "##, no expansion occurs; lower case keyword may be
expanded through `chill-upper-keyword' (##C-return##) with cursor on
the keyword or just at right of the keyword.

It is also possible to type all in lower case, then select the proper region
and turn all keyword to upper case through `chill-upper-region'
(##M-return##).

See also documentation for `chill-upper' (##M-C-return##).


== Indentation ==

Line indentation is made through `chill-indent-line' (##TAB## or
##NEWLINE##).

See also documentation for `chill-indent' (##C-tab##).

Sentence indentation is made through `chill-sentence-indent-parser'
(##M-C-q##), this command indents a complete CHILL action at once,
that is, if sentence indentation is activated in the beginning of an
##IF## action the indentation proceeds until find the corresponding
##FI##.

The following variables control indentation behavior:

; `chill-indent-comment' : Non-##nil## value indicates to indent
##/*...*/## comment.

; `chill-tab-always-indent' : Controls the operation of the ##TAB##
key.
: Accept the following values:
: ##t##
:: hitting ##TAB## always just indents the current line.
: ##nil##
:: hitting ##TAB## indents the current line if point is at the left
margin or in the line's indentation, otherwise it insert a real
##TAB## character.
: any other
:: ##TAB## is inserted only within literals -- defined as comments
and strings -- , but line is always reindented.
: Note that indentation of lines containing ##/*...*/## comments is
also controlled by the `chill-indent-comment' variable.

; `chill-group-level' : Indentation of CHILL actions within group delimited by
##(...)## and ##[...]##.

; `chill-indent-level' : Indentation of CHILL actions within surrounding block.

; `chill-else-level' : Indentation of the ##ELSE##/##ELSIF##
lines within the surrounding ##IF## (or ##CASE##, if it is
##ELSE## line).

; `chill-label-offset' : Extra indentation given to a line which preceding line
is a label.

; `chill-alternative-offset' : Extra indentation given to a line which is an
alternative of ##CASE##, ##DELAY## ##CASE##,
##RECEIVE CASE##, or ##ON## structures.

; `chill-continued-statement-offset' : Extra indentation given to a line that
does not begin a new action, like the lines beginning with ##WHILE##,
##FOR##, or ##WITH##.

The default values are:

   chill-indent-comment              t
   chill-tab-always-indent           'indent
   chill-group-level                 1
   chill-indent-level                3
   chill-else-level                  0
   chill-label-offset                2
   chill-alternative-offset          0
   chill-continued-statement-offset  2

See documentation for `chill-set-style' and `chill-add-style'.


== Line Comment ==

Line comment is defined on CHILL language since CCITT Z.200/1989, but some
CHILL implementation may not define it.

The variable `chill-line-comment' specifies which string is the line comment
delimiter (see documentation on the code).  The default line comment is
##"--"##, like Ada.

See below for filling comment paragraph.


== Quick Help Feature ==

When editing a text that contains some action which syntax is not so easy, or a
built in procedure which has a lot of parameters, it displays a window that has
a tip of syntax action or built in procedure parameters.

The variable `chill-quick-help' specifies if quick help feature is on
(non-##nil## value) or off (##nil## value).  The default is
on (non-##nil##).

See documentation for `chill-quick-help-alist'.


== Other Commands ==

== Credits ==

Some features were adapted from other packages.

Many thanks to all people who made the following packages:

: cc-mode.el
:: A lot of features/ideas:
:: * ##TAB## command,
:: * hungry delete/auto insert minor mode,
:: * style indentation setting
: ada-mode.el
:: Fill comment paragraph (##--...$##)
: hideif.el
:: Show/Hide comments (##/*...*/##)

Many thanks to Gustavo Chaves <_gustavo_@_cpqd_._com_._br_> who made the very
first ChillModePackage.



== To Do ==

* full support Auto Insert Minor Mode from cc-mode.
* better treatment for preprocessor pragmas.
* support for XEmacs.
