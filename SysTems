Ahlan!  :)  Unfortunately emacs-bidi is on hold right now until we can make the new Emacs release, and then the next step will be to integrate the emacs-unicode-2 branch, and only /then/ will emacs-bidi be integrated into Emacs CVS.  This means no Arabic in the current GNU Emacs...  :(  See DisplayEngineForArabic. -- AlexSchroeder
