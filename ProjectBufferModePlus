Lisp:project-buffer-mode+.el

/This is an extension library for ProjectBufferMode./

== Summary ==

It provides commands to run the project-buffer actions: such as
build, clean, run, debug and update while browsing the files
belonging to this project.

It also provides a command to directly go to the project-buffer
attached to the current file.

== How does it work? ==

When you open a file from the project-buffer; it will attach the
project-buffer to the file's buffer.
The project-buffer is stored inside a local variable called:
 `project-buffer-mode-p-attached-project-buffer'.

== To install it: ==

Put the following lines in your .emacs:
{{{
(eval-after-load "project-buffer-mode"
 '(progn
    (require 'project-buffer-mode+)
    (project-buffer-mode-p-setup)))
}}}
