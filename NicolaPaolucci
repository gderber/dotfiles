My current Emacs setup:
    [[.durdn.emacs]]
    [[.durdn.office.el]]
    [[.durdn.home.el]]

My very personal, very limited selection of tips and things that I don't want to forget about Emacs:

Buffer list:

    C-x C-b will show a list of the currently open buffers

[[bookmark|Bookmarks]]:

    C-x r m  Create a new bookmark
    C-x r b  Recall a previously created bookmark
    C-x r l  Bookmark list

List-buffers / Bookmarks List, useful key bindings:

    o Opens file in other window keeping bufferlist open
    1 Fills frame with selected file


Ultra useful snippets to add to the .emacs:

    ;opens list-buffers but with focus on it
    (defun list-buffers-other-win ()
      "Opens list-buffers and put focus on it"
      (interactive)
      (list-buffers)
      (other-window 1)
      (goto-char (+ 4 (point))))


    (global-set-key "\C-x\C-b" 'list-buffers-other-win)

    ;Moves point/cursor to matching parens
    (defun match-paren () 
      "Go to the matching parenthesis if on parenthesis otherwise insert %." 
      (interactive) 
      (cond ((looking-at "\\s\(") (forward-list 1) (backward-char 1)) 
         ((looking-at "\\s\)") (forward-char 1) (backward-list 1)) 
         ((progn (backward-char 1) (looking-at "\\s\)")) (forward-char 1) (backward-list 1)) 
         (t (forward-char) (message "Não está sobre ( ou )")) 
      ) 
    )  
    (global-set-key "\C-c]"  'match-paren)

    ; open shell with C-c s
    (defun open-shell-window (&optional n)
      (interactive)
      (split-window-vertically -10)
      (other-window 1)
      (shell))

    (global-set-key "\C-cs"  'open-shell-window)

    ;Comment or Uncomment Region python-mode style with C-c #
    (global-set-key "\C-c#"  'comment-or-uncomment-region)

    ;goto line with C-c G
    (global-set-key "\C-cG"  'goto-line)


Keyboard macro to format a raw xml output with using nxml:

    ; Macro to format and indent a random bit of raw xml, requires nxml
    (fset 'raw-indent-xml-output
      [?\M-< ?\M-% ?\C-q ?\C-j return return ?! ?\M-< ?\C-\M-% ?< return ?\C-q ?\C-j ?< return ?! ?\C-x ?h ?\C-\M-\\ ?\C-k])
    (fset 'align-small-xml-element
       (lambda (&optional arg) "Keyboard macro." (interactive "p") (kmacro-exec-ring-item (quote ([134217788 201326629 92 40 91 94 62 93 92 41 17 10 91 94 60 93 43 return 92 49 return 33 134217788] 0 "%d")) arg)))
    (fset 'nick-xml-reformat
       (lambda (&optional arg) "Keyboard macro." (interactive "p") (kmacro-exec-ring-item (quote ([134217848 110 120 tab 109 111 tab return 134217848 114 97 119 tab return 11 134217848 97 108 105 103 110 45 tab 115 109 97 tab return] 0 "%d")) arg)))
    (global-set-key "\C-cX"  'nick-xml-reformat)

To save a buffer with Unix EOL format, type:

    C-x <RET> f unix <RET> C-x C-s

Copied from EmacsNiftyTricks:

    C-u C-SPC – Easy way to navigate back to your previous editing spots. 
                This runs the familiar set-mark, but when called with an ARG, it pops previous marks off the ring. 

    C-SPC C-g – at least in in (S)XEmacs saves the point/sets the mark, 
                without bothering you with the zmacs-region highlighting – MyrkraVerk
                Read the previous comment again now ;)

    M-z zap-to-char – Zap to the char of your choice. 
                      Can be used to delete sentences (enter ".") or tags (">"), 
                      or to delete the n'th occurence of a char (useful for putting quote-delimited 
                      strings into the kill-ring).

    C-u M-! command will insert the result of running command in the current buffer. 
            I didn't know that, and wrote a small function to do that. 
            Very handy for things like date. - AadityaSood
