Resulting from discussion on [[2005-06-10]], it was agreed that
EmacsWiki is a resource for other EmacsMailingLists, help forums and
OnlineResources and that these very same forums are also a resource
for expanding and improving the EmacsWiki.

Questions and EmacsFaq""s culled from these places or posted in this
Wiki should be located in a relevant article and not in a giant list
of questions or FAQs article.  This credo will maintain EmacsWiki's
scalability and usefulness.  The EmacsFaq entry on EmacsWiki is a
listing of "official" Emacs FAQs external to this Wiki.  User
questions with ambivalent subjects can be submitted to OpenQuestions.

Creating an automated system on the Wiki that can help users find
answers to their problems was welcomed but efforts will likely be
deferred in favor of other contributions.
