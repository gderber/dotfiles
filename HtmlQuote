Here is a little function that will quote the special HTML characters `<', `>', and `&'.  Useful
when you want to paste source code into your HTML (or XML) pages.

    (defun html-quote (start end &optional arg)
      "Quote html code in region for inclusion into other HTML.
    With optional argument ARG reverse operation.
    This applies to the region between START and END."
      (interactive "r\nP")
      (let ((commands (if arg
                          '(("&amp;" . "&")
                            ("&lt;" . "<")
                            ("&gt;" . ">"))
                        '(("&" . "&amp;")
                          ("<" . "&lt;")
                          (">" . "&gt;"))))
            (text (buffer-substring start end)))
        (with-temp-buffer
          (insert text)
          (while commands
            (let ((from-str (caar commands))
                  (to-str (cdar commands)))
              (goto-char (point-min))
              (while (search-forward from-str nil t)
                (replace-match to-str nil t)))
            (setq commands (cdr commands)))
          (setq text (buffer-substring (point-min) (point-max))))
        (kill-region start end)
        (goto-char start)
        (insert text)))

This is the same thing as `M-x sgml-quote' in the standard HtmlMode (part of SgmlMode), so consider adding the following to your InitFile.

    (defalias 'html-quote 'sgml-quote)
