[new]
I have moved the the library to Lisp:sml-modeline.el (see http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ElispArea#toc6).
*Note: This is already an old version and I will delete it in a while.*

[new]
The file [http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~nxhtml/nxhtml/main/annotate/head%3A/util/sml-modeline.el sml-modeline.el] contains the global minor mode /sml-modeline-mode/ that turns this feature on.

This is distributed as part of [NxhtmlMode nXhtml] where you find the latest version (the link above points to the latest version in the repository at Launchpad).
