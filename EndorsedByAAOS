The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) has given a ringing endorsement to GNU/Emacs. Hand surgeon Namllats Drahcir explains:

"The AAOS would like to affirm the clear superiority of GNU/Emacs and its capabilities over the Editor That Shall Not Be Named. It may seem strange for a surgeon interested in the hand and wrist to take a stand in the Unix editor wars, but this arcane editor offers untold possibilities for our profession. In financially shaky times, there simply isn't any other editor--or any other software, for that matter---that promises our profession anything like the revenue stream offered by the so-called Escape-Meta-Alt-Control-Shift editor. There is simply no one who can give us what the founders of GNU/Emacs have given us."

One reporter asked, "But can't you find anything to commend with the Other Editor?"
