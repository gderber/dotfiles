=== XEmacs pops up DOS message window when it starts ===

: *Resolution*
: 
: Please get latest xlib and xwem packages following instructions at http://www.xemacs.org/Documentation/packageGuide.html.
: 
: Reinstalling from http://www.xemacs.org/Download/win32/setup.exe will neither include xlib nor xwem because they have been removed from http://ftp.xemacs.org/windows/setup.ini.
: 
: Upgrading package from the pre-release area (see http://www.xemacs.org/Documentation/packageGuide.html#Where_to_get_the_packages) will also solve the problem.
: 
: The latest sumo tarball of XEmacs packages (see http://www.xemacs.org/Documentation/packageGuide.html#The_Sumo_Tarball) does not include the fixed xlib and xwem packages yet!

If you have a recent verson of XEmacs running on Windows then you may have the following problem:

Whenever you start XEmacs you get a coresponding console window with the messages. 

    Loading xlib-math...
    Loading xlib-math...done
    Loading xwem-compat...
    Loading xwem-compat...done

This is caused by bugs in the xwem and xlib packages. These are X Window's specific packages so it is safe to uninstall them. (either through the XEmacs package manager or through the netinstall setup.exe installer). See the following threads for more details.
