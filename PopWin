== Overview ==

popwin is a popup window manager for Emacs which makes you free from the hell of annoying buffers such like <code>*Help*</code>, <code>*Completions*</code>, <code>*compilation*</code>, and etc.

Take an example. When you complete file names during <code>find-file</code>, the (annoying) <code>*Completions*</code> buffer will appear in a newly splitted window. You might understand the necessity of the window, but you may wonder why the window still remains after completion...

popwin resolves there problems. Windows of such temporary buffers will be shown as a popup window, and you can close them smoothly by typing <code>C-g</code> in anytime.

This doesn't seem to work when using split buffer with one buffer being ERC. Clue? -- [new:RyanDavis:2011-03-08 10:53 UTC]

I have added a ticket for that problem. Matsuyama

== popwin and special-display-function/special-display-regexps ==

popwin disables the normal <code>special-display-function/special-display-regexps</code> functionality: E.g. when you use popwin just for display-buffer-function</code>, but you set as well <code>special-display-regexps</code> to "("\\*info\\*.*"), info buffers aren't created in their one frame anymore.

My workaround is an in-between <code>display-buffer</code> function:

    ;;
    ;; to restore special-display-function with pop-win.el
    ;;
    (defun leo-popwin:display-buffer (buffer-or-name &optional not-this-window)
      "Display BUFFER-OR-NAME, if possible, in a popup window, or as
    usual. This function can be used as a value of
    `display-buffer-function'."
      (interactive "BDisplay buffer:\n")
      ;; `special-display-p' returns either t or a list of frame
      ;; parameters to pass to `special-display-function'.
      (let ((pars (special-display-p name-of-buffer)))
        (if (and pars special-display-function)
            (funcall special-display-function
                     buffer (if (listp pars) pars))
          (popwin:display-buffer buffer-or-name not-this-window))))
    
    (setq display-buffer-function 'leo-popwin:display-buffer)

This is certainly not perfect, but does the job for now. [[halloleo]] 2012-03-09 23:35 UTC
