Lisp:loops.el tries to spot patterns in a list.  In this particular
case, it tries to find whether the beginning of the list is repeating.
Useful for RepetitionDetection, for example.

It has variables to determine upper and lower bounds for the length of
a repetition, how often it must repeat, and it has a variable to
determine whether these repetitions must be consecutive or not.  It's a
small pattern detector, I guess.

Loop detection is useful for the RepetitionDetectionPackage.
