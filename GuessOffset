This library provides a hook for c-mode and related modes. It tries
to detect the `c-basic-offset' used for a visited C source file,
transparently adapting to different code layouts.

More information in the source commentary. 

* Lisp:guess-offset.el

This is the first release of guess-offset and should be considered beta 
software. If it happens to guess wrong, you may have to tweak the parameters 
a little, they are documented. Please share your wisdom in this case.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.

[new]
Turning on indent-tab-mode for buffers which use tabs for indentation would be very useful.

Using SmartTabs, there's no offset to guess. :)

I've also written a package for this:  [[GuessStyle]] -- [[nschum]]

== Next Generation ==

There is a successor to `guess-offset.el' called `dtrt-indent.el' which - among other improvements - is now a minor mode, supports additional languages, provides detection of `indent-tab-mode', and has better heuristics.  Visit the [https://github.com/jscheid/dtrt-indent project page] or follow this [https://raw.github.com/jscheid/dtrt-indent/master/dtrt-indent.el direct link to HEAD].

Again, suggestions are welcome. Please use Github's bug tracker as I won't drop by this page very often.   -- JulianScheid
