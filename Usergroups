If you run a meetup or are aware of a group of people meeting and discussing Emacs, please add them here so other people can connect.

Meeting other Emacs geeks is a great way to pick up ideas and learn even more. Can't find an Emacs meetup near you? [http://harryrschwartz.com/2015/09/14/starting-an-emacs-meetup.html Here are a few tips on starting an Emacs meetup]. Alternatively, try joining or organizing one of the virtual EmacsHangouts.
