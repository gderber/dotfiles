DeepakGoel:  In eshell, if you do not like to use eshell-rebind (eg. me), then C-a takes you to beginning of line.  It would be nice if it took you to 'just after prompt' instead.  The 'official' way to do that is probably to add fields to eshell (which i don't quite know how).   Here though, is my function that does that and more.. it makes C-a intelligent.  (bol-maybe-general-my is general enough to be used by other funcitons.)

 (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook '(lambda ()
                               (local-set-key (kbd "C-a")
                                              'eshell-bol-maybe-my)))




 ;;;###autoload
 (defun bol-maybe-general-my (prompt &optional alt-bol-fcn)
  ""
  (interactive)
  (if (and (string-match (concat "^" (regexp-quote prompt)
                                 " *$")
                         (buffer-substring-no-properties
                          (line-beginning-position)
                          (point)))
           (not (bolp)))
      (beginning-of-line)
    (if alt-bol-fcn
        (funcall alt-bol-fcn)
      (beginning-of-line)
      (search-forward-regexp prompt))))

 ;;;###autoload
 (defun eshell-bol-maybe-my ()
  ""
  (interactive)
  (bol-maybe-general-my (funcall eshell-prompt-function)))

Note that C-c C-a already does this in eshell as well as other modes with a prompt.  It is a standard Emacs convention.

Or you could use the more simple eshell-bol that is already defined.

    (defun my-eshell-maybe-bol ()
      (interactive)
      (let ((p (point)))
        (eshell-bol)
        (if (= p (point))
          (beginning-of-line))))

Why doesn't C-a already bind to eshell-bol or something similar to Shaleh's definition? Why is the convention to bind to C-c C-a instead? -- EthanGlasserCamp

It does in Emacs 23. -- PhilHagelberg
