;;; Commentary:

;;; Usage

;;; * Installation
;;; Download perlmonks.el from https://github.com/metaperl/emacs-perlmonks
;;; Put this file somewhere on your load-path and in your .emacs put:
;;; (require 'perlmonks)

;;; * Authentication
;;; The first time you use this mode, you need to call perlmonks-login
;;; which will set a cookie which will last for 10 years

;;; * Editing
;;; You initiate your use of this mode by opening up a file with a .monks 
;;; extension. This will open the file with major mode nxml and minor mode 
;;; perlmonks. From that point, you simply write a post using
;;; Perl Monks Approved HTML tags - http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=29281
;;; There are some convenience functions within perlmonks.el for editing:
;;; ** Editing Support
;;; perlmonks-paragraph
;;; perlmonks-code
;;; perlmonks-blockquote

;;; * Posting
;;; Once your post is complete, perlmonks.el has support for posting to the
;;; following areas:
;;;  M-x perlmonks-seekers-of-perl-wisdom
;;;  M-x perlmonks-meditation
;;;  M-x perlmonks-reply
;;; Just call one of those commands while in your .monks buffer
