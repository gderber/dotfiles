My Emacs Anniversery is in May.  I started in 2007, so I guess I am turning into an old-timer.  I am still learning stuff, which is why I love emacs.

Emacs projects are:
* Mindwave Emacs - Make emacs react to a Mindwage EEG device.  https://github.com/jonnay/mindwave-emacs
* Emagicians Starter Kit - There are many starter kits, but this one is mine.  https://github.com/jonnay/emagicians-starter-kit
* Ergore - A bitlbee/ERC bot. http://github.com/jonnay/ergore
* ToDoChiKu - A Growl/Snarl interface for emacs.  Comes with a few helpers.
* I did some work on TwIt.  Ever sence they stopped supporting basic authentication over HTTPS I stopped working on it.  I don't use twitter enough, and don't want to write an OpenAuth library.
* [[Tagging]] - Originally from Conrad Barski M.D., I have heavily hacked it to work with ECB
* file-journal.el - I took it over, and started to make some adjustments.
* Lisp:work-timer.el - A simple timer that tells you when you need to start working, and when you need to start relaxing.  Uses ToDoChiKu. 
* Lisp:i-ching.el - i-ching for Emacs.
* Lisp:flip-tables.el  goofy fun. Put an emoji table flipper on your kill ring.

Emacs Projects that I won't kill, but I don't work on anymore:
* cruisecontrol.el - An Emacs Controller for CruiseControl.  Right now it just starts a build.
* DevKitEmacs - A helper mode for interfacing with devkitpro.  Making the compilation and testing of NDS homebrew much easier.

Emacs Projects that I will kill one day soon:
* JisekiDesktop - I don't use it anymore.  It was a neet idea though!  Slated for death in 2013
* TwIt - Slated for death in 2013, unless someone else takes over.
* MojoSdk - Helper functions for interacting with the mojo SDK development tools.   Now that the new palm handset is dead, is this useful?

For one job I do Web Development.  My weapons of choice are org-mode, js-mode, swank-js and nxhtml.
For fun I play with fun languages, Scheme, Javascript, Clojure, and Kilns.

OrgMode and ParEdit Mode are my favorite modes.  I am also fond of the Bovinator and ECB.
