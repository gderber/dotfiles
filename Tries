A trie stores data associated with "strings" (not necessarily the string data type; any ordered sequence of elements will do). It stores them in such a way that both storage size and data lookup are reasonably space- and time- efficient, respectively.

But, more importantly, advanced string queries are also very efficient, such as finding all strings with a given prefix, or finding all strings matching a regular expression, with the results returned in alphabetical or any other sort-order, returning only the first few results if so desired.

Requires the [[Heaps]], TaggedNFA, [[Queues]], and [[AVLtrees]] packages. The latest version (0.2.4 released January 2011) can be obtained from:

* Trie package download: http://www.dr-qubit.org/download.php?file=predictive/trie.el
* Trie git repository: <code>http://www.dr-qubit.org/git/predictive.git</code>
* Web-site: http://www.dr-qubit.org/emacs.php#structures

The development version is hosted in the same git repository as PredictiveMode. Note that the git repository URL is a git repository, ''*not*'' a web-site. You cannot view it in a web browser. To grab the latest development version, clone the repository using:

  git clone http://www.dr-qubit.org/git/predictive.git


Please send bug reports and suggestions to [mailto:toby-predictive@dr-qubit.org toby-predictive@dr-qubit.org] (you can post them here as well if you like, of course). I don't check this page regularly, so anything not emailed to me is likely to languish here unnoticed for some time.
