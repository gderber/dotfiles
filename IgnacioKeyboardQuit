I replaced the keyboard-quit function with this one. -- IgnacioPazPosse

{{{
(defun my-keyboard-quit()
  "Escape the minibuffer or cancel region consistently using 'Control-g'.
Normally if the minibuffer is active but we lost focus (say, we clicked away or set the cursor into another buffer)
we can quit by pressing 'ESC' three times. This function handles it more conveniently, as it checks for the condition 
of not beign in the minibuffer but having it active. Otherwise simply doing the ESC or (keyboard-escape-quit) would 
brake whatever split of windows we might have in the frame."
  (interactive)
  (if (not(window-minibuffer-p (selected-window)))
      (if (or mark-active (active-minibuffer-window))
          (keyboard-escape-quit))
    (keyboard-quit)))


(define-key global-map (kbd "C-g") 'my-keyboard-quit)
