== Some elisp tools and packages on which I have worked... (many of which may be very old) ==

=== Rinari ===
I'm the current maintainer for [http://github.com/eschulte/rinari/tree/master Rinari] (A Minor Mode for working on Ruby on Rails projects), focusing on a small code footprint, quick navigation inside the rails project, and the execution of tests, consoles, and servers with output dumped into a proper compilation buffer.

=== ruby-compilation and inf-ruby ===
the latest version of which are best tracked in the [http://github.com/eschulte/rinari/tree/8248b597234d0c4a4c767ee2d88c2c1038ce8cb9/util util directory of rinari]

Lisp:vm-thread.el adds collapsing of messages by thread to the ViewMail summary buffer

=== sgf-mode ===
I'm working on a  [http://github.com/eschulte/sgf-mode/tree/master sgf-mode] for editing sgf files, and playing GO which is still in the early stages.
