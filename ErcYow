To annoy people on IRC with some pinhead wisdom add the following function to your ~/.emacs.el

 (defun erc-cmd-YOW ()
   (let ((yow (replace-regexp-in-string "\n" "" (yow))))
     (erc-send-message yow)))


Now you can just type /yow to send a yow line to the current channel.

: If you want the message inserted, but not shown to you as a message, try:

<pre>
(defun erc-cmd-YOW (&rest ignore)
  "Display some pinhead wisdom into the current ERC buffer.  I'd
rather not see it messaged to me, just sent out."
  (let ((yow-msg (replace-regexp-in-string "\n" "" (yow nil nil))))
    (erc-send-message
     (concat "{Pinhead wisdom} "
             yow-msg))))
</pre>
