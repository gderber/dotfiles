Android is a mobile platform backed by Google.  It runs on a linux / dalvik stack.  See http://code.google.com/android/ for more details. 

Emdroid is Android for Emacs.  Like the Eclipse plugin, EmDroid will be a wrapper around the commandline tools. It is currently being developed by JonathanArkell.

It currently features:
* Android project creation
* Launching the emulator
* Installing apks in a running emulator 

Future plans are:
* integration with JDE
* A comint process for the Android Shell
* Some kind of project system?  

Help developing this is strongly encouraged, from small suggestions to full implementation.
