[:end of line]
EndOfLine or '''[::line ending]''' characters separate lines in buffers and files. A line ending is also sometimes called a '''[::newline]''', '''[::hard return]''' or '''[::line feed]'''.

Different platforms sometimes use different line endings. For instance, UNIX uses a newline character (`C-j'); MS Windows uses a carriage-return character (`C-m') followed by a newline character.
