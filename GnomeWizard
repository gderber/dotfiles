Gwizard is a set of Elisp functions to aid GTK+/Gnome/Bonobo
programmers written by DirkJanBinnema.

The package contains gwizard.el, the documentation and sample code.
There's also an article about the Bonobo support online:

It shows how some elisp makes programming Bonobo components quite easy.

Note, however, that it's for the Gnome 1.x environment.
