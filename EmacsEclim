This projects aims at creating an emacs frontend to Eclim, see http://eclim.sourceforge.net for the backend and http://github.com/emacs-eclim/emacs-eclim for the actual emacs interface. With the help of eclim we can provide emacs-users with a tight eclipse integration. The ultimate goal of the project is to simplify java development with emacs and bring the best features from eclipse to emacs.

== Issues & Questions ==
I can't seem to get imports to work, and can't find any resolution to these errors. When I invoke eclim-java-import, I get the error "Unrecognized option: -n". When I invoke eclim-java-import-missing, I get the error "No command 'java_import_order' found." Seems like there may have been an update to eclim without a corresponding update to emacs eclim? Or maybe I have mismatched versions? Any ideas?

== Contribute ==
The project is living on github at https://github.com/emacs-eclim/emacs-eclim. Since the active development has just started lately we are glad for every contribution. Feel free to fork the project and send me a pull-request when you got some new features implemented or some bugs fixed.
