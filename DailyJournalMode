Since everyone seems to want some method for handling diary/journal-like entries, I hacked up daily-journal mode.  Basically, it binds the `j' key in the CalendarMode to a function which displays a text buffer for the day.  It's just a plain text buffer, and can contain notes, events, holidays, your Daily Affirmation (if you're inclined to that sort of thing)--whatever.  The current version is available at:

Let me know if it's useful, or /dev/null fodder :) ...

It '''is''' useful! Maybe it could be even more useful if there was something like

    (defun daily-journal-weekly-report (&optional mdy start-day)
      "Collects all journal entries of the current week into a temporary buffer."
      (interactive)
      (let* ((cur-date (or mdy (calendar-cursor-to-date t)))
    	 (abs-day (calendar-absolute-from-gregorian cur-date))
    	 (day (calendar-day-of-week
    	       (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute abs-day)))
    	 (i 0))
        ;; search first day
        (while (not (= day (or start-day calendar-week-start-day)))
          (setq abs-day (1- abs-day))
          (setq day (calendar-day-of-week
    	       (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute abs-day))))
        ;; prepare buffer
        (switch-to-buffer-other-window
         (get-buffer-create "*Weekly Journal Summary*"))
        (let ((inhibit-read-only t))
          (erase-buffer)
          ;; insert journal entries for next seven days
          (while (< i 7)
    	(let* ((greg-day (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute abs-day))
    	       (date-string (calendar-date-string greg-day))
    	       (entry (daily-journal:get-entry greg-day
    					       daily-journal-default-filename)))
    	  (if entry
    	      (insert (format "%s\n%s\n%s\n\n" 
    			      date-string (make-string (length date-string) ?=)
    			      entry)))
    	  (setq abs-day (1+ abs-day))
    	  (setq i (1+ i)))))
        (setq buffer-read-only t)
        (goto-char (point-min))))
    
    (define-key calendar-mode-map "w" 'daily-journal-weekly-report)

which might be helpful when you prepare yourself for your weekly deparment meeting. -- UlfJasper

This is great! I'll try to add some font-locking sometimes when I have the time. -- HenrikJÃ¶nsson

Great! I want this for a long time. It will be better if the entries can be marked with color in the calendar and can be visited handily.
And, with password-protected, it will be perfect! :) -- RockyDd
