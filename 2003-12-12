There's a discussion about coding-systems used for internal files such as the abbrev file on xemacs-design.  The question is: coding cookies or ISO 2022 format?

Hrvoje Niksic says:

: The problem cookies can solve is corruption when
the user switches environments.  For example: I work in a
Latin 2 environment and use only Latin 2 characters in
cookies.  When the abbrev file is saved, no ISO 2022
escapes will be used.  But I'd like the abbrev file to be
interpreted correctly even if I happen to be in a
different environment -- hence the coding cookie.

Stephen J. Turnbull replies:

: Or the ISO-2022 magic.  The _only_ difference is that the coding
cookie is human readable and corruptible by people too smart for their
own good.

Plus other interesting points, of course.  ;) -- AlexSchroeder
