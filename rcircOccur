Somebody said something in your [[rcirc]] session but you no longer remember where? ##/occur foo## and find all occurences of foo using `multi-occur' (see OccurMode).

{{{
(eval-after-load 'rcirc
  '(defun-rcirc-command occur (regexp)
     "Run `multi-occur' for all buffers in `rcirc-mode'."
     (interactive "sList lines matching regexp: ")
     (multi-occur (let (result)
		    (dolist (buf (buffer-list))
		      (with-current-buffer buf
			(when (eq major-mode 'rcirc-mode)
			  (setq result (cons buf result)))))
		    result) regexp)))
}}}
