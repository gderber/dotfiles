The scheme.el package included with Emacs provides a major mode for editing [[Scheme]] files.  It can be used with the CmuScheme (cmuscheme.el) or ExScheme (xscheme.el) packages for interacting with inferior scheme processes.

See QuackPackage for extensions to SchemeMode.

See GuileIde on using SchemeMode and other tools for developing in [[Guile]].
