Originally an XEmacs hacker turned into a great mediator between the Emacs and XEmacs communities.

His homepage [http://josefsson.org/] contains code for SMTP/STARTTLS support for Emacs [http://josefsson.org/emacs-smtp-starttls.html]
and a manual for smtpmail.el [http://josefsson.org/smtpmail.html], amongst lots of other cool code (and cool travel pics [http://josefsson.org/travel/]).

He uses XEmacs, I believe.
