bugz-mode provides a nice Emacs user interface to the bugzilla bug tracking system. Underneath it uses the pybugz command-line program to communicate with the remote server.  The goal is that you must be able to do all kind of activities in the bug tracker without leaving Emacs, without X-window and, most importantly, without a bloated modern web brower like firefox. 

bugz-mode homepage is at http://jemarch.net/bugz-mode.html
