Here's some choices of modes for editing crontab files,

=Harley Gorrell=

HarleyGorrell has written a crontab-mode.el (original page gone it seems, but get it from archive.org)

From the commentary:

* I want to keep my crontabs under rcs to keep a history of the file.  Editing them with 'crontab -e' is rather cumbersome.  My method is to keep the crontab as a file, under rcs, and check in the changes with 'C-c C-c' after editing.
* The remote systems are expected to share a filesystem. If they dont, modify crontab-shell or crontab-apply to suit your needs.

= Ch. Tronche =

A <code>crontab-mode.el</code>, includes an rsh to edit crontabs on remote machines,

= Christopher D. Orr =

<code>crontab.el</code> which comes with XEmacs.  Works in Emacs too.

Save-buffer installs the crontab.  Optionally keeps a copy in ~/.crontab too, if you don't trust the crontab to look after it.

Errors from crontab resulting in the new content not stored don't seem to be reported very well.
