From a signature by RonanWaide:

`F' is group reply. This is because `G' is for sort and `g' is for get new
mail. And `G' is for sort because `sort' used be called `group', and anyway
`S' is for save mailbox and `s' is for file message in folder, because `f' is
group reply and `F' is group reply including original text.

this is really funny - LathI

Other mnemonics are a Gnus fortune file available here (note: the link is
 defunct as of 2010-04-21):

http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~kester/gnus_and_emacs/

Add the gnu_tips.dat and gnus_tips file to a ~/fortune directory.  You can add your own gnus tips to the gnus_tips file (don't forget the % separators!), and create a new gnus_tips.dat file for fortune using the <tt>strfile -r gnus_tips</tt> command.

You can then email gnus newbies from a group to which you have set the posting style thus ('G p' to edit the group parameters):
<pre>
(posting-style
  (signature
   (concat "kester\n--**--\n\n"
	   (shell-command-to-string "fortune ~/fortune")))))
</pre>
This puts a little gnus 'tip' for your newbie friend as a signature...
