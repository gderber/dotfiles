When you visit the wiki using http://www.emacswiki.org/, you will
be redirected to http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki. The new code
in place will then use the interface appropriate for your language
preferences (if available).

Thus, if you run w3m and use "de, en;q=0.9, fr;q=0.8, pt;q=0.7, es;
q=0.6, it;q=0.5" for your "Accept-Language header", then you will get
the German interface. Basically the wiki script runs emacs-en,
emacs-fr, emacs-de, or any of the other interfaces for you, based on
the preferences.

If this doesn't work for you, visit the following debug link:

* http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/lang

Post the info on your homepage, send mailto:alex@emacswiki.org and let
me know.  You can always switch the interface explicitly by using the
language menu on the SiteMap.
