* (apt-get) Install emacs-intl-fonts and all the packages it suggests.

*  Ensure that bdf-directory-list knows about these fonts: 
    (add-to-list 'bdf-directory-list 
	     "/usr/share/emacs/fonts/bdf")



* Restart X, or else, type xset fp rehash.

* Restart emacs (in windowed mode).

* In a buffer of choice, type C-x RET C-\ devanagari-itrans.  This
  sets your input method.  Later, type C-\ to toggle between hindi and
  english.

* Type away the phonetic roman equivalents of the Hindi words, and
  they will appear in hindi.

* When in the hindi-input mode, typing any special characters like %
  or ', etc., make emacs go into an infinite self-insert loop --
  pressa bunch of C-g's to get rid of that.

* To convert a piece of hindi text into its phonetic roman equivalent
  or vice versa, use M-x devanagari-(encode/decode)-itrans-region.  As
  you will soon find out, that conversion is not perfect and has minor
  bugs.

* When you reload a file in which you had typed some hindi, the
  characters are disjoint and not formed into words.  To convert them
  back, this works for me: M-x indian-to-devanagari-region, followed
  by M-x devanagari-compose-region.

* See many other useful functions in your emacs' devan-utils.el and
  devanagari.el.


You might want to modify sentence settings to include the poorna virama -
<pre>
(setq sentence-end-base "[.?!।][]\"'”)}]*")

== Printing your buffer == 

* Install intlfonts from here: http://directory.fsf.org/localization/intlfonts.html : Download file, uncompress it, type ./configure followed by 'make install' -- this will send them to their default directory: /use/local/share/emacs/fonts/



* Add this to your .gnomerc, or .xsessionrc, as appropriate: 
**  xset +fp /usr/local/share/emacs/fonts
**  xset fp rehash
** Also eval the above 2 lines for the current session. 

* Note that intlfonts here and emacs-intl-fonts above seem to have
  things not in common, so probably best to use both.

  
* Instead of the above step, You could also modify your XF86config-4
   manually to frob the font path there, but note that if you go this
   route, this file will stop getting auto-updated from then on when
   you upgrade your debian xserver-xfree86 package.


* Next,     add this to InitFile and restart emacs:
 (setq ps-multibyte-buffer 'bdf-font-except-latin)

* Your default value for bdf-directory-list already contains the above font-path, but if you installed the fonts elsewhere, ensure that bdf-directory-list knows about that path.


* Now, the only problem remaining is that the printout is not as
  pretty as the typed in text: In the printout, The letters comprising
  a word aren't joined together, which takes away from the beauty of typed hindi.

== CVS Emacs ===

CVSEmacs with the CDAC fonts can render devanagiri characters. The CDAC fonts are given below. Both Xorg (6.9.0.dfsg.1-4) as well as XFree86 (4.2) support the fonts.

Try having these for cvs emacs seems to help half way.(works perfectly in xfree86. xorg needs a bug fix)

[new]
It seems to work in Xorg now. Version 6.9.0.dfsg.1-4.

[new]
The cdac fonts which can be found here: 
* http://www.m17n.org/emacs-indian/cdacfonts.tar.gz 

Get the fonts and then use the makefile to extract the pcf and bdf fonts. You might need to use <code>mkfontdir</code> to create a fonts.dir. Add the directory to xorg.conf (or the font server config).

<pre>

(load-library "quail/indian")
(set-fontset-font "fontset-standard" 
		  (cons (decode-char 'ucs ?\x0900) (decode-char 'ucs ?\x097F))
		  "-freetype-untitled-medium-r-normal--33-240-100-100-p-163-iso10646.indian-1")
(set-fontset-font "fontset-standard"
		  (cons (indian-glyph-char 0 'devanagari) (indian-glyph-char 255 'devanagari))
		  "-freetype-dv ttsuresh-medium-r-normal-33-240-100-100-p-119-devanagari-cdac")
(toggle-input-method)
</pre>

[new]
It does not seem to be necessary to mess with quail. You can create a new fontset. I prefer doing this in Xresources. So, the fontset will look like: (only the last two are important for Hindi)
<pre>
Emacs.Fontset-0:-xos4-terminus-*-r-normal-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1, \
  chinese-gb2312:-*-fangsong ti-medium-r-normal--*-*-*-*-*-*-gb2312.1980-*, \
  unicode-mono:-gnu-unifont-medium-r-normal--16-160-75-75-c-80-iso10646-1, \
  unicode-wide:-gnu-unifont-medium-r-normal--16-160-75-75-c-80-iso10646-1, \
  mule-unicode-0100-24ff:-freetype-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-devanagari-cdac, \
  indian-glyph:-freetype-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-devanagari-cdac
</pre>

* C-u C-x = on a Hindi character in the HELLO file yields <code>mule-unicode-0100-24ff</code> but adding <code>indian-glyph</code> can't hurt.

== CVS Emacs (emacs-23) ===

If you install m17n-lib 1.5 or above [www.m17n.org] along with lohit devanagari font, emacs can
display hindi very well [[image:emacs-gnus-hindi]]

== devangari-itrans tweaks ==
If you're typing Hindi, "nh" and "ld" don't give you what you probably expect, as of Emacs v24.5.1.

"nh" gives you "ऩ्", while you probably wanted "न्ह्"; "ld" gives you "ळ्", while you probably wanted "ल्द्" (I'm told these "unwanted" ones see more use in Marathi, which (TIL) is also written in Devanagari.) 

This is some slightly messy (and probably incomplete) code which may make your life easier, and make it possible to type some common words which use these letters. (Or, you can use devanagari-inscript, which doesn't have these problems but has more of a learning curve)

<pre>
(with-eval-after-load 'ind-util
  (remhash "ऩ्" (car indian-dev-itrans-v5-hash))
  (remhash "nh" (cdr indian-dev-itrans-v5-hash))
  (maphash (lambda (key val)
             (if (string-match-p "^ld" key)
                 (remhash key (cdr indian-dev-itrans-v5-hash))))
           (cdr indian-dev-itrans-v5-hash))
  (maphash (lambda (key val)
             (when (string-match-p "^ऩ" key)
               (remhash key (car indian-dev-itrans-v5-hash))))
           (car indian-dev-itrans-v5-hash))
  (maphash (lambda (key val)
             (when (string-match-p "^nh" key)
               (remhash key (cdr indian-dev-itrans-v5-hash))))
           (cdr indian-dev-itrans-v5-hash))
  (mapc (lambda (elt)
          (let ((lat (car elt))
                (dev (cdr elt)))
            (puthash dev lat
                     (car indian-dev-itrans-v5-hash))
            (puthash lat dev
                     (cdr indian-dev-itrans-v5-hash))))
        '(("nh"  . "न्ह्")
          ("nha" . "न्ह") ("nhaa" . "न्हा") ("nhA" . "न्हा")
          ("nhi" . "न्हि") ("nhii" . "न्ही") ("nhI" . "न्ही")
          ("nhu" . "न्हु") ("nhuu" . "न्हू") ("nhU" . "न्हू")
          ("nhe" . "न्हे") ("nhai" . "न्है")

          ("ld"  . "ल्द्")
          ("lda" . "ल्द") ("ldaa" . "ल्दा") ("ldA" . "ल्दा")
          ("ldi" . "ल्दि") ("ldii" . "ल्दी") ("ldI" . "ल्दी")
          ("ldu" . "ल्दु") ("lduu" . "ल्दू") ("ldU"  . "ल्दू")
          ("lde" . "ल्दे") ("ldai" . "ल्दै"))))
</pre>

If you make these changes after starting Emacs, your changes probably won't take effect until you (find-library "indian.el.gz") and evaluate the following function call (I tried copying this call elsewhere to evaluate it more conveniently, but it inexplicably didn't work) -
<pre>
(quail-define-inscript-package
 indian-dev-base-table inscript-dev-keytable
 "devanagari-inscript" "Devanagari" "DevIS"
 "Devanagari keyboard Inscript.")
</pre>
