I'm a programmer (at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LANL LANL]) in many languages: thus Emacs.

Among my languages are Emacs Lisp and C, so I'm of some use to Emacs and users thereof.  The main point I want to make here is that I am in full "Stuart Davis Herring", which sometimes complicates searching for my contributions (especially when I do not control what is used).
