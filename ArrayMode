Array mode comes with Emacs.  It is an extremely primitive (obsolete?) way of editing fixed width tables of text.

it was introduced by its author [https://web.archive.org/web/20141007042108/http://computer-programming-forum.com/49-fortran/a85ecd7eec7d78e4.htm as follows]:

: Array mode for Gnu Emacs
: I work for a company called GZA.  We are consultants in the fields of 
: geotechnical engineering and groundwater resources.  In this work, I 
: often use finite-difference models of groundwater flow and contaminant 
: transport.  This invariably involves creating and editing large data 
: files for fortran programs.  In particular, these data files usually 
: represent two-dimensional arrays of integer or floating point numbers. 
: In order to facilitate the creation and editing of these arrays, I 
: have written a new major mode for Gnu Emacs, which I call "Array 
: Mode".  Array mode allows one to move through the buffer by fields, to 
: copy fields into adjacent cells, to copy whole rows or columns, etc. 
: In this manner, one is spared the agony of counting spaces, making 
: sure Fortran I/O does not get confused, etc. 
: If you are interested in Array Mode, drop me a line.  I will either 
: send you a copy or post it to the net. 
: Happy hacking!
