The ElispArea is gone, at least as far as the separate directory of uploaded text files is concerned.
Just paste EmacsLisp files onto ordinary wiki pages.  If the page starts with ";;;" it will be formatted correctly.

Most of the links into /elisp are being redirected to something interesting.  Here are some examples:

* http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/ -- redirects to a filtered index of all pages
* http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/index.html -- same thing
* http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/changelog.html -- redirects to recent changes
* http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/align.el -- redirects to the page
* http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/align.el.diff -- redirects to the latest diff
* [[align.el]] -- EmacsLisp is stored on ordinary pages! Make link <nowiki>[[</nowiki>align.el]]
* Download:align.el
* Lisp:align.el which is equivalent to <nowiki>[[</nowiki>align.el]], but is better for searching.

*Oops!*

What I did not realize was that the RSS with full page content was going to be about 4MB long.
I had loaded them in order of file size, so the last 15 RSS items contained the 15 largest files...
That brought load on the server up to about 100.
That's when the admins decided to shut down my sites while I was enjoying the German movie /Barfuss/.
I've temporarily disabled the "full" feed. -- AlexSchroeder
