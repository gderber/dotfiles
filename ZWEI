An emacsen editor for the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab Lisp machines
written by DanielWeinreb and MikeMcMahon in the early 1980s.   ZWEI is the acronym for
"ZWEI Was [[EINE]], Initially".  Later ZWEI was renamed and further developed as [[Zmacs]].

Technical improvements made by ZWEI included being programmable with Lisp,
and representing an editing buffer as a doubly-linked list of lines.
