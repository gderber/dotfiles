== changes to make it work on emacs 22 ==

You have to make 2 little changes to make it work on a emacs 22
running on a tty.

One is a broken regexp, the other is to remove a check for emacs 19.

here are the snippets:

;;JAVE seems broken emacs 22
;(defconst visual-basic-continuation-regexp "^.*\\_[ \t]*$")
(setq visual-basic-continuation-regexp "^.*\_[ \t]*$")

...

(defun visual-basic-enable-font-lock ()
  ;; Emacs 19.29 requires a window-system else font-lock-mode errs out.
  (cond ((or visual-basic-xemacs-p window-system t) ;;JAVE just always run this code

== VBScript REPL ==

You can use this mode to edit VBScript, although the keywords are quite
a bit different.  If you're used to scripting in a REPL environment then
VbsReplMode might be what you're looking for. -- CharlesSebold

==Old Emacs Things for MS Windows==
The ftp directory for old things have been moved to
http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/old-gnu/emacs/windows/docs/ntemacs/contrib/ 
where you can find for example visual-basic-mode.el


==Discussion of Availability==


The HtmlHelperMode homepage has a link to a VB mode.  There seems to
be a newer version out, however.  KevinWhitefoot has extended
FredWhite's original visual basic mode. The new version also
understands vbg and vbp files, and automatically loads all associated
files.

[BROKEN LINK: this link now gets re-directed to Steve Kemp's new homepage, no VB mode there - guess I'll have to write my own - *sigh*]

: Did you ask him? -- AlexSchroeder

: http://www.xemacs.org/Download/elispPackages.html refers to http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/docs/ntemacs/contrib/visual-basic-mode.el [BROKEN LINK 2009-02-25]. Is that a good replacement for AFM broken link?  -- AdrianAichner

The gnu.org site currently has no such directory and the xemacs site just points back here.  
The site http://members.fortunecity.com/kwhitefoot/MySoftware.html and its mirrors seem to be adware bait sites.  

I did find 2 links that, for the moment seem to be intact.
