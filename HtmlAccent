HtmlAccent replaces non-ASCII characters (such as äöü) with their named entities (such as ##&auml; &ouml; &uuml;##).
This can be useful if you want to make sure to support very old browsers that do not handle decoding correctly.

Use the function provided by the package to translate non-ASCII characters to named entities when you're read to publish your files, use the other function provided to reverse the process if you want to resume editing.

Why not use iso-iso2sgml and iso-sgml2iso? -- Julio

= =
I didn't know this resource existed. I think iso-iso2sgml and iso-sgml2iso are better than my functions. If you want delete this you can, because I don't think my functions are that efficient, like iso-iso2sgml and iso-sgml2iso should be.

Thanks for the advice.
