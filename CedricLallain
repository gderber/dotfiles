I use Emacs:
* at home
* at work
* under Windows
* under Linux
* not in bed :-)
* neither in the shower :-)

== About Emacs ==

I used Emacs for a couple of months now (2 to be accurate). I have only one reproach to this editor: the learning curve, Emacs is a great editor, however you need to be willing to spend 2 or 3 hours at first in order to learn it. 

On the positive side: the feeling of controlling the editor instead of having to force yourself to use what the editor is willing to give you is really unique.

== Emacs vs XEmacs ==

I started with XEmacs (using it for about two months), and switched to Emacs for the following reasons:
* the general latency of XEmacs, a constant feeling of slow reaction from the editor
* the time XEmacs takes to colorize text files with font-lock
* most online scripts work straight away with Emacs but required to be modified to work with XEmacs
* the Emacs online community

Take a look at [[EmacsAndXEmacs]] ....

== The Emacs Script == 

The main scripts I use are: 
* xcscope: very handy to find you way into a big project
* git: Switching from p4 to git... I couldn't go back to p4 now... (not with the way it is now at least)
* redo: I was kind of surprise that Emacs has a Undo system without any option to do a "redo"

I also use: 
* highlight-current-line
* bm
* dabbrev-highlight
* dired+

== My personal contribution ==

* RecordType        - Define record type for Emacs Lisp
* LogBuffer         - Log buffer utils
* FindDiredPlusPlus - Redefinition of find-dired
* TcpClient         - Network interface for emacs
* XCscopePlus       - Providing an extension to xcscope

== New contributions ==

* ProjectBufferMode     - A generic project mode
* ProjectBufferModePlus - Extension which allow to run user command from files belonging to a project-buffer-mode buffer
* ProjectBufferOccur    - Search in project files functionality
* SlnMode               - Mode to open sln file
* FsProject             - Create projects based on the file system
* [[IProject]]          - Interactive project mode
