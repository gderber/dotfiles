[http://icfpc.plt-scheme.org/ The Eighth Annual ICFP Programming Contest] -- writing robber and cop programs!

Volunteers -- meet on the EmacsChannel to coordinate and add your name plus cheesy message here:

* AlexSchroeder: To think that I wrote EmacsRobots many moons ago...  But nothing ever evolved out of it!  :'(

Anyway, if anybody is interested in joining me for a proof-of-concept Emacs entry, we should start splitting up the task.  Pick a task or refine the list and /then/ pick a task:

# handle initialization, registration, renaming, etc.
# developping a strategy (no coding required)
# write a robber
# write a cop that never cooperates
# do the planning thing for the cops including the evaluation of plans, the voting, etc.

Our submission will be called "#emacs".

Edit the sources on the wiki, or start branches as required and link to them:
