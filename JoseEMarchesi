Hi, my name is Jose E. Marchesi, and i am an Emacs user (or i use emacs :)).

I am from Spain.

I have been a gnudist since 1995. Currently, i coordine GNU Spain (the
spanish chapter of the GNU project) and also i play some roles into
the global GNU project (tasks list manager, webmaster, maintainer,
translator, developer).

Usually you can find me as [::jemarch] into the IRC network (#emacs
channel).

My jabberID is jemarch at jabber.org

Finally, i live on jemarch at gnu.org

I maintain a little homepage in http://es.gnu.org/~jemarch

: Welcome!  As I said on IRC already, Spanish pages are always welcome on this wiki.  :)  -- AlexSchroeder
