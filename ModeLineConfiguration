The Emacs ModeLine is configurable, offering special modes and functions that change its functionality.

Display of some standard information in the mode line is governed by these minor modes (each toggle on and off):

* `display-time-mode' -- Enable the display of the current time, see DisplayTime
* `line-number-mode' -- Enable or disable the display of the current line number, see also LineNumbers
* `column-number-mode' -- Enable or disable the display of the current column number
* `size-indication-mode' (for Emacs 22 and up) -- Enable or disable the current buffer size, Emacs 22 and later, see Manual:size-indication-mode
* `display-battery-mode' -- Enable or disable laptop battery information, see DisplayBatteryMode.

Here are particular enhancements to the mode line:

* ModeLineMinorModeMenu -- Pop up minor-mode menus from the mode-line.
* ModeLinePosition -- Display region size if region is active (in TransientMarkMode) and highlights the column number if greater than `modelinepos-column-limit'.  
* ModeLinePosAtBeginning -- Display line and column numbers at the start of the mode line, so they are visible even when the TextCursor is inside a function with a long name.
* HideModeLine -- Save screen real estate by hiding the mode line.
* LunarModeLine -- Display current lunar phase in the modeline.
* ModeLineDirtrack -- show the buffer's current directory in the mode-line.
* SmlModeLine -- Indicate in the mode-line, in a scrollbar-like way, the portion of the buffer that is visible in the window.
* ShowPointMode -- Show value of point in the mode-line.
* [[wcMode]] -- Show character/word/line count in mode-line
* NyanMode -- Indicate your position in the buffer in the mode line, with a little help from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyan_Cat Nyan Cat].
* PowerLine -- How to make VIM-like [https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline powerline].
* SmartModeLine -- Smart, sexy, and space efficient mode line. [https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/smart-mode-line/]
* OcticonsModeLine -- Nice icons in the mode line thanks to the [https://github.com/rougier/emacs-octicons octicons] font.

Customize the mode line by altering the `mode-line-format' variable.  The `header-line-format' variable customizes the HeaderLine.

The mode line is [[buffer]]-specific, meaning that the same buffer has the same mode line in different windows.

The mode line may be [[HideModeLine|hidden]] for a specific buffer by changing `mode-line-format' to `nil'.

The mode line normally looks something like this:

    -u:**-F1  *scratch*   All L12    (Lisp Interaction)-------%-

which may be cryptic to new users, so to make it like this:

    Lisp Interaction: buffer *scratch*, line 5 -- user: alice

use:

    (setq mode-line-format
          (list
           ;; value of `mode-name'
           "%m: "
           ;; value of current buffer name
           "buffer %b, "
           ;; value of current line number
           "line %l "
           "-- user: "
           ;; value of user
           (getenv "USER")))

The mode line uses the same data structure as the FrameTitle and HeaderLine:

* '''string''' -- A string appears verbatim except for %-constructs
* '''symbol''' -- A symbol stands for its value, the symbols `t' and `nil' are ignored as is any symbol whose value is void.
* '''(string rest...)''', '''(list rest...)''' -- A list whose first element is a string or list means to process all the elements recursively and concatenate the results. This is the most common form of mode-line construct.
