Vi has a feature for changing the current word.  The following is discussion on accomplishing it in Emacs.

== Change the ending of a word ==
[new]
If I have the TextCursor halfway through a word, how do I quickly edit the rest of the word? (e.g. in vi this would be "cw"). 

[new:DrewAdams:2004-12-25 18:11 UTC]
Here are a few ways:
* Type the new word ending, then `M-d' (`kill-word') to delete the old word ending. (Or reverse the order: delete the ending first, then type a new ending.)
* In DeleteSelectionMode, `##M-@##' (`mark-word') to select the old word ending, then type the new word ending to replace the old.
* Toggle `overwrite-mode' ''on'' using the ##[insert]## key (`overwrite-mode'). Type over the old word ending, deleting extra characters with `C-d'. Toggle `overwrite-mode' back ''off'' again when the old ending has been overwritten or deleted.

== Change the whole word ==

If I have the TextCursor halfway through a word, how do I quickly edit the whole word? (e.g. in vi this would be "bcw").

* Type `M-b M-d'  to kill the whole word, and type the new word.
