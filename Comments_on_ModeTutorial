I just tried to use this way of setting my mode map, and I failed

I switched 


   (define-key map "\C-j" 'newline-and-indent)


to 
 
   (define-key map "\C-j" 'org-mode)


and it didn't do anything (\C-j did not start org-mode)

this mode map tutorial is more up to date

Worked for me.  Were you in `wpdl-mode' when you pressed `C-j'?
