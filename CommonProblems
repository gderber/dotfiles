This page discusses possible pitfalls and gotchas.  See also the section "Lossage" in the EmacsManual about "dealing with Emacs trouble".

Emacs key sequences can vary, depending on whether you use an X window system, the console, a terminal emulation, SSH, and so on.

* ScrollLock -- MS Windows users: If your '''Caps Lock''' seems to be having no effect, hit your '''Scroll Lock''' key.

Replace highlighted text with what I type rather than just inserting at point.  Add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (delete-selection-mode t)

=== Help versus Backspace keys===

The environment may change how the BackspaceKey, `C-h' or `F1' are interpreted. 

* Try `C-h ?'.
* If that does not work, try `F1 ?'.
* If that does not work, try `M-x help-with-tutorial': hit `ESC' (Escape), then
hit `x', then type `help-with-tutorial', then hit Enter or Return.
