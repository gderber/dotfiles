This package has been marked *obsolete* in Emacs 24.1. You should probably be using [[rx]] instead.

Start by loading the symbolic regular expression engine:

    (require 'sregex)

You can also load it interactively, of course: M-x load-library RET sregex RET.  From the help for the function `sregexq' some examples:

    (sregexq (or "Bob" "Robert"))  =>  "Bob\\|Robert"

    (sregexq "M*A*S*H")  =>  "M\\*A\\*S\\*H"

    (sregexq (opt (or "Bob" "Robert")))  =>  "\\(Bob\\|Robert\\)?"

    (sregexq (group (or "Go" "Run"))
             ", Spot, "
             (backref 1))             =>  "\\(Go\\|Run\\), Spot, \\1"
