I use Emacs (which I prefer) on Linux, Windows and Mac, but I can use vi when I have to (and I don't mind ;) )

GNU/Linux is my operating system of choice: Currently, I run Debian "testing". I recently also started using Aquamacs on a MacBook Air.

I recently converted to OrgMode and RememberMode trying to get organized.

For VC I use git (and svn when I have to).
