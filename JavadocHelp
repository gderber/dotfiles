= Javadoc-Help for Emacs =

Javadoc-Help is an add-on module for Emacs that let you jump to a Javadoc page in the browser.  While editing in Emacs, you can place your cursor on a class name, hit a key (F1) to search through multiple online and local Javadocs, and jump to the Javadoc documentation for the class in the system web browser.

When working on Java projects, it's often needed to look up the Javadoc documentation of a class in JDK, in the third party libraries, or in the current project. Javadoc-Help allows you search through multiple javadocs quickly in Emacs, remote or local, and open up the found class in a browser.
