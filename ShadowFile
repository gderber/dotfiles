From the commentary:
This package helps you to keep identical copies of files in more than one
place -- possibly on different machines.  When you save a file, it checks
whether it is on the list of files with "shadows", and if so, it tries to
copy it when you exit Emacs.

I use the following to copy my ~/NOTES file to a fileserver at the end of
the day on a Windows machine. Since the fileshare is mounted as a separate
drive, I have to provide my own machine name as the "host".

    (require 'shadowfile)
    (setq shadow-literal-groups
          '(("/asc@BSIZUG04:h:/Alex Schröder/NOTES"
             "/asc@BSIZUG04:~/NOTES")))

To be honest, I also ##(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)##, so that I'm using the
control character ##\366## instead of the ##ö## in the filename. ;) -- AlexSchroeder

Probably the most annoying thing about how this package is written is that the hostname MUST match exactly the return value of the system-name function.  This really needs to be documented in the info manual for the package as I just spent hours figuring out how to get this to work (had to run the source code though the debugger and everything).

Basically I wanted to copy my .emacs file to a location where I have a git repository.  I have a Windows 7 machine using ntemacs.  My computer name is Sam-PC.

I had set my shadow-literal-groups via this elisp:

    (setq shadow-literal-groups
      '(("/Sam@Sam-PC:~/.emacs" "/Sam@Sam-PC:~/../../Documents/site/.emacs")))

I could not for the life of me figure out why it wouldn't work.  I finally discovered it was because (system-name) returned "SAM-PC" not "Sam-PC".

Case normalization should be used against the (system-name) command, and localhost ought to be interpreted as an alias of (system-name) when matching the hostname.

All in all a nice feature but its documentation needs improvement.  -- SamPeterson
