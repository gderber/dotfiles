Provides some small additional function of eshell, the full-featured
shell written in elisp. Functions include a prompt replacement
(primarily replaces value of $HOME with a "~"), a "clear" function,
which clears the screen/buffer much like clear (Unix) or cls (DOS),
and a remote command, which lets you send the eshell a command from
some outside piece of lisp code.
