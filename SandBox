This page is the place to '''try stuff'''. You can also use the

I think what never worked was to intermix these.

* foo
: bar
* foo
: bar

Works.

* foo
** bar
:: baz

This doesn't work as expected because "baz" is the first item of a definition list.

* foo\\
bar

* foo
\\bar

* foo\\bar

------

* A foo is not the same as a bar.\\\\
A bar is much smaller than a foo.
* A tata is longer than a toto.\\
But a toto is deeper than a tata.
