lunar-mode-line.el is a ModeLineConfiguration package allowing to display the current lunar phase in the ModeLine.

It is available as a Git repository:

<code>
git clone git://gaffer.ptitcanardnoir.org/lunar-mode-line.git

It would be cool if it would use xpm's or some sort of icon in X frames. Unfortunately I'm totally untalented in this regard.

You can try https://github.com/atykhonov/lunar-mode-line . I just updated lunar-mode-line so it can represent moon phases by means of images.
