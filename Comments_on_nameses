I've made most of the modifications today, so I haven't tested everything for a long time. Please share your thoughts about how to improve this code :)!

You should move the code to the Elisp area. Then change this page to a description of the library. Or remove this page altogether if you do not want a description page. To remove it, replace the text by just "DeletedPage".

All right, I'll try to make this more descriptive tomorrow, with a link to the code.
