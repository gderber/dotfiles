RichardStallman asks for non-programming help in [http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2003-09/msg00390.html this post, 2003-09-24] on [http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/ emacs-devel]:
'''Checking the Lisp Reference Manual for errors'''

I've updated the [http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/emacs/emacs/lispref/ Emacs Lisp Reference Manual] for the change that have
been made since the previous revision, or most of them.  Now I need
help in checking it for errors, and for places that were correct but
are not correct any longer.  To do a good job of this would require
that each part of the text be read by at least two people.

Could people start reading whatever parts of the manual they would
like to check?  When you check a part, please tell me which part
whether you found any errors or not, so I can note down that it has
been covered.
