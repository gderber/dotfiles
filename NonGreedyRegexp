The forms ##*?##,  ##+?##, and ##??## provide non-greedy versions of ##*##,  ##+##, and ##?## and have been available since Emacs 21.1, released in 2001.

== Emulation with ancient emacsen ==

In Emacs 21.1 and later versions Perl-like non-greedy syntax (.*?) has
been implemented.


Howto get "minimal matching" on a particular <code>\\(.*\\)</code> sub expression, ie. howto write a non-greedy regular expressions as in Perl <code>(.*?)</code>:

 \\(\\|.\\)*

A strict POSIX implementation will still match the above greedily, but
most backtracking implementations will do the above match non-greedily,
just as <code>(.*?)</code> would.
The above hack works in Emacs versions earlier than 21.1. 


In either case the * and + special characters can be used to create a
non-greedy regexp.
