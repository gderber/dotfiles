Logview major mode for Emacs provides syntax highlighting, filtering and other features for various log files. The main target are files similar to ones generated by Log4j, Logback and other Java logging libraries, but there is really nothing Java-specific in the mode and it should work just fine with any log that follows similar structure, probably after some configuration.

The mode is meant to be operated in read-only buffer, so all the command bindings lack modifiers.

Out-of-the-box the mode should be able to parse standard SLF4J (Log4j, Logback) files as long as they use ISO 8601 timestamps and certain UNIX files in /var/log.

The mode is available [http://melpa.org/#/logview from MELPA] and as the source code [https://github.com/doublep/logview from GitHub].
