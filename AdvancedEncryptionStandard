This package provides an implementation of AES natively in elisp.

Additionally this library contains implementations of Cipher-block chaining and Offset Codebook Mode as modes for buffer encryption and decryption.
Further a mechanism for random password generation from random user input is also implemented.

It is recommended to byte-compile the library before usage.

Updates will be published on Github https://github.com/Sauermann/emacs-aes
