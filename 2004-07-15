I suggest adding 'link rel=next' and 'link rel=prev' links to these
''yyyy-mm-dd'' pages, what do you reckon.  Maybe a few of the other so
called standard links could be used too with the wiki.  For one
there's the copyright link, and top could take to the SiteMap, and the
up could possibly take to a list of all days from within the last
month from these date-pages, or a category for others.

Hmm... maybe these are features which need to be implemented in the
engine (OddMuse), before turned on here.  Oh well, just a thought.  I
like the standard links, as these common functions could be uniformly
presented by the browser. -- [[tekonivel]]
