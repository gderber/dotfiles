Sunir is a big fan of QEdit for DOS. For UNIX, he usually uses FTP from Windows. One day, he may be convinced to try emacs again.

: I used QEdit on DOS, too.  I had to switch to Emacs because the university host would only provide vi, pico, and emacs.  As I started to like it after a year or two, I got myself EmacsForDOS. -- AlexSchroeder
