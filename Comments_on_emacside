It's unclear how this works or what it does. Is there an explanatory web page or code commentary somewhere?

A complete documentation is within the wiki on the project page.
Whats exactly is unclear?
What it does is written on the first line if you visit the site.

Hm, perhaps it's my browser. All I see is this:

What browser are you using?
But

I'm using Google Chrome on Windows right now, with Adblock Plus, Privacy Badger, and other extensions.

As for the zip file: that's why I added "note the very innocuous zip link" on my first edit. :)

I currently update the scm software. Thank you for the note. Thats why I added more text to the wikipage.
This weekend I will be able to link permanent zip file links.
