Here is code by EricMarsden allows you to query a dict server from within Emacs.

* Source: http://www.chez.com/emarsden/downloads/dict-web.el

This uses the UrlPackage (which, for older versions, is part of [[w3]]).
See DictMode for a version that uses the dict protocol directly.

w3-forms is not in latest emacs package. a workaround, just change the line
;         (url-request-data (dictweb-form-encode pairs))
         (url-request-data (concat "Form=Dict1&Query=" word "&Strategy=*&Database=*"))
