== Prolog Modes ==

You can switch to Prolog mode with ##M-x prolog-mode##.

The default Prolog mode that comes with GNU Emacs (23 and newer) is derived from [http://bruda.ca/emacs/prolog_mode_for_emacs prolog.el] and provides all the features one would expect, including syntax highlighting, auto indent, and full interaction with an inferior Prolog process.  The mode supports in principle any Prolog system, though it is primarily maintained with SWI Prolog in mind. It also has some special tweaks for GNU Prolog (starting from version 1.4) and SICStus Prolog, and explicitly supports Prolog's close relatives Eclipse and Mercury.

The default Prolog mode bundled with GNU Emacs prior to 23 provides only basic features such as syntax highlighting.  The website [http://bruda.ca/emacs/prolog_mode_for_emacs prolog.el] is maintained to provide XEmacs and GNU Emacs (<23) with advanced Prolog support.

== Issues ==

If I select "Consult" file, buffer or region, Emacs opens a new buffer within the current frame.  However, I prefer to have the prolog session running in a different frame.  I would like to setup (or alter) the mode so that it does not open a new buffer if I already have a prolog buffer in a different frame.  How can I do this?  --PinkerTon.

I haven't tried Prolog mode (but used to use Prolog a lot), but if you want buffers to open in their own frames and frames to be reused as you describe, set `pop-up-frames' to `t'. Otherwise, there might be some particular setting for Prolog mode. Try `C-h m' when in the mode. Try also `M-x apropos RET prolog'. -- DrewAdams
