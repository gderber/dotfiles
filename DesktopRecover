Currently desktop-recover.el is hosted at github.  It's available
here: [http://github.com/doomvox/desktop-recover/blob/master/desktop-recover.el desktop-recover.el]

The desktop-recover project uses the standard "desktop.el"
package for session management including crash recovery.

Using this system, when you re-start your emacs you're presented
with a buffer showing a list of of what you had open before,
treating it as a list of candidates of things you may want to
open again.  You can just hit return to accept the defaults, or
you can go through the list, marking or un-marking which ones you
want (using the keystrokes <TT>*</TT> or <TT>u</TT>).

Once you hit return, the state of your desktop will be saved
automatically during idle moments as you continue working.
If you choose not to hit return, the automatic desktop save
system will be left off for the session.

Installation instructions are in the comments at the top of
the desktop-recover.el.

The desktop-recover-setup.el file shows a usage example,
(this file is not a necessary component of the system).

Further documentation is included as the help strings for dummy
variables which all begin with the prefix:
<TT>desktop-recover-doc-</TT>.  See desktop-recover-doc-toc for a
listing of them.

This code was developed with GNU emacs 23 in mind.  It has not been 
tested with other flavors.
