A simple elisp function to call vim to open and edit current buffer. 

(Update: [[toggle-viper-keychord]] : an alternative vi-like editing solution in conjunction with KeyChord and ViperMode )

Instructions: Please change the path of vim/gvim to where it is on your computer.

 - Todo: re-open the edited file in Emacs, after opening it in vim.


{{{
(defun vim-current-buffer ()
  (interactive)

	(gvim-file-name (buffer-file-name (current-buffer))))
    (if gvim-file-name
	(progn
	  (kill-buffer (current-buffer) )
	  ;; need to understand the start-process and how to handle the process exit
	  ;; to be implemented: when process ends, will reopen file in emacs
	  (setq result (start-process "gvim" nil gvim-program gvim-file-name)))
      (error "Current buffer doesn't point to a file yet."))
    (unless result (find-file gvim-file-name))))
