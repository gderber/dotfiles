You can create an RTF document in Emacs, and if you have MS Word on your system you can automatically print it from Emacs
at the same time.

Step 1 of the following technique creates a temporary RTF document, which will be printed and deleted in Step 2.

--------------------

Step 1: Use Emacs to create a temporary RTF document.  (see PrintUsingWordRtfWrite and PrintUsingWordRtfInsert)

RTF is basically a plain Ascii text markup language.  With a little reverse-engineering, you can create a "shell" RTF
file into which you can place your text and then write out the RTF file containing your text.  This is essentially
what the code referenced above does:


<rtf-write-buffer> is an Elisp function that is called to convert the current buffer to RTF and write it to a file.
The parameters are:

   ORIENT           - a string: "P" causes the RTF to be in portrait orientation, any other string is landscape.
   LINE1 and LINE2   - two strings used for the header on each page.
   FILENAME          - is a string for the fully qualified output file name.
   START and END     - (optional) buffer positions if only part of the buffer is to be converted.
                       By default the whole buffer is converted to RTF.


<rtf-insert> is an Elisp function that inserts the massive amount of header text required to generate
the RTF file.  It is called by rtf-write-buffer (rtf-write-buffer modifies some of this inserted text).

---------------------

Step 2: Use Emacs to get MS Word to print your document.

VBScript is a very convenient tool for the Emacs programmer/user.  Simple scripts can be used to access other Windows
programs from Emacs.  Provided that you have Word loaded on your system, this VBscript will print a specified
file to a specified printer, then delete the document:

PrintUsingWordVbs

The following Elisp function call will execute this script:

    (w32-shell-execute 1 vbs-wrd (concat "\"" docfile "\" \"" printer "\""))

Where:

     vbs-wrd is an Elisp variable having the pathname of the script file.
     docfile is an Elisp variable having the pathname of the RTF file.
     printer is an Elisp variable having the name of the printer.
