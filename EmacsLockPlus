Extensions to standard library `emacs-lock.el'


Adds the following features:

* When locking any buffer, you are prompted for a little note that
  helps you to remember why you locked the buffer.
  
* If any buffer prevents Emacs from exiting, pops up this buffer
  and displays your note, if there is one. Also displays the note
  if you try to kill any locked buffer.
  
* Adds a mode-line indicator which displays a capital "L" for
  locked buffers (and a lowercase "l" for non-locked buffers, if
  this is enabled. You can deactivate this indicator if you don't
  want it.)
  If you move the mouse over the indicator, the locking note
  is displayed.
