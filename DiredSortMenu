'''dired-sort-menu''' is a library by FrancisJWright that sorts the directory listings in DiredMode in various ways and provides a [[menu bar]] and popup menu. The popup menu is bound to `S-mouse-2', which is compatible with the `mouse-3' popup menus of '''[[DiredPlus|Dired+]]'''.

Here is a screenshot showing the `dired-sort-menu' popup menu with sorting by file '''Extension''' and '''Recursive''' sorting selected (so that subdirectories are included). This screenshot also shows '''Dired+''''s treatment of an inserted subdirectory (purple band to set it off).
