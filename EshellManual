Here is a longer EshellTexi than what comes in the eshell tarball. It was posted to comp.emacs on 2001-09-07 by Christoph Conrad.

NicFerrier has turned this texi into an installable [[http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/eshell-info/0.0.1 package]]

The github repo for this is [[https://github.com/nicferrier/eshell-manual here]].

Since sitting down to write a complete manual has always seemed such
an onerous task, I'm asking anyone who has something to say to
contribute documentation for Eshell, the Emacs Shell.

Unfortunately, this Wiki doesn't work as well for me, since I don't
have convenient access to the text.  So, care to jump on over to
another one?  I'm running an emacs-wiki-mode based Wiki on my home
machine.  You can edit the docs from here:

* http://alice.dynodns.net/wiki?EmacsShell
(Link broken as of 2009-07-15 -- anyone surprised? --Jason)

To read a Japanese translation:

* http://www.gci-net.com/~johnw/eshell_ja.html

To read a Spanish translation:

* http://www.manticore.es/cgi-bin/info2html.cgi?(eshell.es-utf8)Top  (the official)
* http://www.manticore.es/cgi-bin/info2html.cgi?(eshell2.es-utf8)Top  (the longer)

The real problem with keeping the source for those files on the Emacs
Wiki server is that I can't work on them when I'm remote with my
laptop.  What would work best for me is if they were kept under CVS on
your server, which I could then download, and later merge and
re-upload when I'd finished making remote changes of my own.  So, I
need two things: The possibility of public contribution, and the
ability to edit/navigate the files locally as well -- whether or not
I'm connected to the Net.  By keeping the files on alice.dynodns.net,
I *do* have them under CVS, and so can handle merging and conflicts
with no problem. -- JohnWiegley

Eventually WikiRemote is supposed to solve this problem, but it needs
some work.  ^_^ -- AlexSchroeder

Heh, that's funny.  The old documentation IS the sources, with the
code deleted.  In the old days I intended Eshell to be
self-documenting, but after a discussion with RMS I came to realize
that presenting information is a different thing from merely recording
information about it.

However, in all that time many other projects have come my way.  True
to the free software model, if someone is willing to pay me for
documentation (the "support" side of this project), I am more than
willing to put time into it.
