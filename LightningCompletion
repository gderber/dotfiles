The author, JohnPalmieri, says:
: ''Lightning completion is an improvement on whatever completion emacs does already;''
: ''it incorporates dynamic completion: completion without having to hit the TAB key''
: ''or anything else. This is very useful when added to commands like find-file or''
: ''switch-to-buffer or describe-lisp-function.''

Lightning completion is available from http://www.math.washington.edu/~palmieri/Emacs/light.html.

It has not been updated recently (30 September 2005).

[new] The official page is defunct.

[http://web.archive.org/web/20060205175757/http://www.math.washington.edu/~palmieri/Emacs/light.html web.archive.org] still has a copy of the file and its documentation. I've copied the file itself here:

Lisp:light.el

The HTML documentation is going to be more readable the web.archive.org link above, but I've preserved a copy of the raw HTML here:

[[LighteningCompletionDocumentation]]

[new] In fact John's code is now on !GitHub:

https://github.com/jhpalmieri

Lightening Completion is part of the [https://github.com/jhpalmieri/ultratex ultratex] repository.

 Lightning completion package
 ----------------------------------
 (Version 0.60 of 1999/04/28)
 
 The lightning completion package lets Emacs use "dynamic completion"
 on any number of things.  By dynamic completion, I mean that you don't
 need to hit the tab key to initiate completion: once it is on, it
 stays on until there is a unique completion or it is turned off.  This
 can be disconcerting at first, but once you get used to it, it is
 quite useful--especially when used with commands like find-file or
 describe-function.
 
 The lightning completion package was written by Mark Haiman and Nick
 Reingold, then modified by John Palmieri (including getting everything
 to work with Emacs 19).  Many suggestions were made by various people
 at MIT, Yale, and elsewhere.
 
 
 The lightning completion distribution files are:
 
    Changelog:    A log of changes made to various parts of the package.
    INSTALLATION: Installation instructions.
    Makefile:     Helps you install the package.
    README:       This file.
    light.el:     The main file in the lightning completion package.
    light.texi:   Lightning completion documentation, in texinfo format.
    recent-changes.html:  A more verbose, less formal list of changes 
		  than is in ChangeLog.
 
 Actually, all you really need is the file light.el, unless you want to 
 read documentation or something like that.
