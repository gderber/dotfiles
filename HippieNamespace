==Overview==
Enabling this minor mode adds a limited number of very common
prefixes to the `hippie-expand' expansion list.  These prefixes
(deduced from buffer content) will be the first completions
considered when hippie-expand is invoked.

Furthermore, namespace completions are treated specially: when
`hippie-expand' proposes a namespace completion, it does not cycle.
Instead, the completion is immediately accepted, and further
invocations of `hippie-expand' build from the expanded text.

For example, the common prefix of all symbols in this library is
"hippie-namespace-".  If the user types "hi [hippie-expand]" or
even just "h [hippie-expand]", the full prefix is expanded.

"hi [hippie-expand] [hippie-expand]" will start cycling through the
completions which match the prefix.

This mode makes more sense for some languages and less sense for
others.  In most languages, the declared "namespace" is
infrequently used in its own context.  (For Emacs Lisp that is
not the case.)

==Keybinding==

Note that you should also have `hippie-expand' bound to a key.
Many people override dabbrev expansion:

    (define-key global-map (kbd "M-/") 'hippie-expand)
