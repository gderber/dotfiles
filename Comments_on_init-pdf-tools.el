This was great! I am using Parabola (ArchLinux) and I always struggled with the epdfinfo issue. I installed it from AUR (aur.archlinux.org: cask-git), and now I don't have issues. I want to say that using make -s, and installing as a TAR also works '''M-x package-install-file RET pdf-tools-${VERSION}.tar RET'''  <--  from http://tech.memoryimprintstudio.com/pdf-annotation-related-tools/) Thanks!
