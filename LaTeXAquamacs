=Writing LaTeX with Aquamacs=

Use M-x latex-mode (normally Option-x latex-mode in Aquamacs) to edit LaTeX files. Use C-c C-c latex to compile.

Aquamacs is in PDF mode by default.


==Setting up PDFView==

PDFView is a free, open-source PDF Previewer that will automatically show you a refreshed preview of the document after it has been compiled. It integrates nicely with Aquamacs.

The following line for ~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el will cause AUCTeX (latex-mode) to use PDFView for PDF files, and TEXniscope to view DVI files:

 (setq TeX-output-view-style (quote (("^pdf$" "." "open -a PDFView.app %o") ("^dvi$" "^xdvi$" "open-x11 %(o?)xdvi %dS %d") ("^dvi$" "^TeXniscope$" "open -a TeXniscope.app %o") ("^pdf$" "." "open %o") ("^html?$" "." "open %o"))))

In PDFView, use the following configuration in Preferences -> LaTeX:

 Preset: Emacs
 Command: "/Applications/Aquamacs Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient"
 Arguments: --no-wait +%line "%file"


==Using TeXniScope==

See AquamacsTexniscope.


==Problems when compiling Latex documents==

*Problem:* When I compile a Latex document from Auctex mode, the typesetting process hangs, and the Latex process buffer displays the following kind of error message:

<pre>
! I can't find file `" -interaction=nonstopmode"'.
<to be read again>
                   \let
<*> " -interaction=nonstopmode\input
                                    {FG.tex}"
Please type another input file name: 
</pre>

*Solution:* At some point, the Auctex package in the Aquamacs distribution got updated from version 11.83 to 11.84. Apparently, [mailto:archive.com/auctex@gnu.org/msg02182.html this broke something with Latex in non-interactive mode].  As the linked article describes, you can fix the problem as follows:

# open the Latex/Customize Auctex/Browse Options menu in Aquamacs
# click on "Go to group" in "Tex command"
# open the item "Tex expand list"
# replace the entry for "%(mode)" by <code>(lambda nil (if TeX-interactive-mode "" "\\nonstopmode"))</code>
# save the options buffer
