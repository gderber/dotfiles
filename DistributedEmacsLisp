Distel is distributed/concurrent programming extensions for Emacs Lisp
(but intended for using with Erlang.) see http://www.bluetail.com/~luke/distel/ and current source at: http://jungerl.cvs.sourceforge.net/jungerl/jungerl/lib/distel/

LukeGorrie, the author, says:
The concurrency is based on TrampolinedStyle, and I'm borrowing
Erlang's CSP-style concurrency model. Scheduling out happens when you
need to wait for a message, so the "receive a message" macro takes
some extra arguments so that it can make a continuation-like object.

: I saw some of your comments on Cliki:CL-Emacs about this.  I was
hoping you could elaborate more here about how this works.  For
instance, the biggest blocker I'm seeing now is in fontifying buffers.
A good example of this is WThreeM buffers with large forms.  Actually,
WThreeM buffers tend to fontify slowly in general.  What would you
suggest doing about this?

Distel is one of the sweetest one person hacks I have ever seen.  It opens
up new vistas.  It should change the meaning of emacs.  But thus far it has been completely ignored.  -- LynHeadley

Not quite, LukeGorrie and a few others have used the concepts used by Distel to create a lisp interaction mode similar to (but less crufty and more featureful than) ILispMode, SlimeMode -- AndreasFuchs

Also not quite in that Distel was really implemented as an Erlang development environment, and Erlang programmers are using it - it's not even a one-man hack anymore :-). A more "pure Elisp" version would be a nice hack. (And thanks for the kind words.) Answering the previous poster, I wonder if "lazy fontification" would be the answer there? -- LukeGorrie

The www.bluetail.com seems to be down. -- [[rubikitch]]

It seems that distel has moved to http://fresh.homeunix.net/~luke/distel/

Distel seems to be here too: http://code.google.com/p/distel/

And now Distel seems to be here: https://github.com/massemanet/distel -- [[SethMason]]
