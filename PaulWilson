: Welcome to the wiki! -- AlexSchroeder

I am as old as Lisp.

I use Emacs -- barely.

Working on learning Emacs on Windows, as a first step to learning Common Lisp, and migrating to Unix, without the GUIs.  Using binary TextEncodingInitiativeEmacs.  The history of my calamities, attempting to learn Emacs on Windows, and subsequent EmacsUlation, would fill a book.  I'll settle for this homepage.
