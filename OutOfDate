Any page on the wiki which has not been updated for a year gets a colored background with a message saying "This content may be out of date."

This is done to make things clear to new users that the content they are viewing might require some changes before being useful to their shiny just-recompiled new emacs.  Obviously this will not appear on pages containing *some* (possibly) outdated content.
