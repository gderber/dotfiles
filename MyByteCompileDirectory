Hi. How does this compare with using a zero prefix arg with `byte-recompile-directory': `C-0 M-x byte-recompile-directory'? That too will compile all ##*.el## files in the current directory and all its subdirectories. How does your command differ? -- DrewAdams

Thanks for your insight. I did not know a zero prefix arg with 'byte-recompile-directory'. Through I tried to byte-recompile-directory with a zero prefix arg, it is not difference between my-byte-compile-directory and byte-recompile-directory within the goal of both. -- Tatsuhiko Kubo.
