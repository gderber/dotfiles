Page mode is a minor mode by BartMassey that shows only a page at a time of a file in the buffer by using [[Narrowing]] on PageBreaks.  The goal was to make an EmacsPresentation for talks and lectures using Emacs.  When using the mode's navigation commands between pages, the top of the page is shown.

Turn on Page mode with `M-x page-mode'.  Navigation and editing commands are on the `C-c' prefix key.

||##C-c C-n##||Forward page||
||##C-c C-p##||Backward page||
||##C-c <##||First page||
||##C-c >##||Last page||
||##C-u N C-c g##||Go to page N||
||##C-c s##||Start new page at point||
||##C-c n##||New page after current||
||##C-c i##||Insert page before current||
||##C-c q##||Turn off page mode||

Though, you can do much with Page mode as with the ExtendedPageHandling library, ##page-ext.el## library, shipped with Emacs for many years.  Additionally, it has support for sorting and searching of pages and also boasts a directory interface for navigating pages by their heading.
