==What is quick-chinese ?==
[http://sanskrit-db.de/blog/pages-output/quick-chinese/ quick-chinese] is a popup dictionary minor-mode for emacs inspired by [http://www.perapera.org/ Perapera]. It uses the CC-licensed [https://www.mdbg.net/ mdbg-dictionary] as source for the entries.
It is written 100% in emacs-lisp and runs without auxiliary software.

==Install==
* You can download a tarball [http://sanskrit-db.de/files/quick-chinese-0.0.1.tar.bz2 here]. 
: Just untar it to a folder on your elisp-path, for example: 
:: tar xfj quick-chinese-0.0.1.tar.bz2 -C ~/.emacs.d/elpa
: add the following to ~/.emacs :
{{{
(require 'quick-chinese)
(global-set-key (kbd "<f11>") 'quick-chinese-mode)
}}}
* You can find quick-chinese.el [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/quick-chinese.el here] but be aware that this alone is not working, you will need the tarball from above with the data-files as well. 
==Usage==
: quick-chinese is a very simple affair. 
: After pressing F11 (or whatever key you decided to bind it to, or alternatively run the command 'quick-chinese-mode') Just move the cursor over a hanzi you want to get the meaning, it will automaticly popup in a small buffer at the bottom of the screen. Since automaticly always the longest word is choosen, you can select the words you want in order to narrow down the search. 
In order to turn it off, just press F11 again or run the command 'quick-chinese-mode' again. 
==Bugs==
quick-chinese might not work when you already have a window showing something else below the current window. In order to get rid of this problem, make sure that the window you wish to use quick-chinese on is the most bottom one.
