This page lists examples of how to automatically add entries to the BBDB.

== Auto-creation of all messages addressed to me ==

This is some code posted to the bbdb mailing list by RonanWaider.  It basically just filters out stuff not addressed directly to a specific set of addresses.  Although he didn't originally mention it, I found that I had to (require 'bbdb-hooks).  This module is a collection of predefined hook functions.  Without further ado:

<pre>
(setq bbdb/mail-auto-create-p 'bbdb-prune-not-to-me)
(setq bbdb/news-auto-create-p 'bbdb-prune-not-to-me)
(defun bbdb-prune-not-to-me ()
  "defun called when bbdb is trying to automatically create a record.  Filters out
anything not actually adressed to me then passes control to 'bbdb-ignore-some-messages-hook'.
Also filters out anything that is precedense 'junk' or 'bulk'  This code is from
Ronan Waide < waider @ waider . ie >."
  (let ((case-fold-search t)
        (done nil)
        (b (current-buffer))
        (marker (bbdb-header-start))
        field regexp fieldval)
    (set-buffer (marker-buffer marker))
    (save-excursion
      ;; Hey ho. The buffer we're in is the mail file, narrowed to the
      ;; current message.
      (let (to cc precedence)
        (goto-char marker)
        (setq to (bbdb-extract-field-value "To"))
        (goto-char marker)
        (setq cc (bbdb-extract-field-value "Cc"))
        (goto-char marker)
        (setq precedence (bbdb-extract-field-value "Precedence"))
        ;; Here's where you put your email information.
        ;; Basically, you just add all the regexps you want for
        ;; both the 'to' field and the 'cc' field.
        (if (and (not (string-match "doug@" (or to "")))
                 (not (string-match "doug@" (or cc ""))))
            (progn
              (message "BBDB unfiling; message to: %s cc: %s"
                       (or to "noone") (or cc "noone"))
              ;; Return nil so that the record isn't added.
              nil)

          (if (string-match "junk" (or precedence ""))
              (progn
                (message "precedence set to junk, bbdb ignoring.")
                nil)

            ;; Otherwise add, subject to filtering
            (bbdb-ignore-some-messages-hook)))))))
</pre>

Question: How about using bbdb-user-mail-names instead of hard coding your email addresses? i'm using something like the following to setq bbdb-user-mail-names.
<pre>
(regexp-opt 
       '("josh_robb@somedomain.com" 
	 "josh_robb@someotherdomain.net"))
</pre>
