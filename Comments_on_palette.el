Sadly, this package isnâ€™t compatible with Emacs 26, due to removal of `make-variable-frame-local'. https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el/issues/64 :(

TinaRussell: OK, thanks. I fixed that. But there seem to be some other problems that affect the display, at least on MS Windows 10 (used to be OK, on Windows XP and Windows 7 at least).  I'll have to dig into those later, when I get some time.
