I use Emacs (I use Viper & Vim too) both at work & at home.
{{{
(concat "sroccaserra" "@" "gmail" "." "com")
}}}
I code every day in C++, Java & Lua.

But I have coded 6 months in a Smalltalk project and code weekly in ELisp, and I like both languages a lot.

Depending of my needs, I also write Ruby, Groovy, & Perl scripts, plus a few lines of Scheme, Haskell, x86 assembly & Java bytecode in my spare time, and enjoy it as well.
