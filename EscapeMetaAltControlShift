Emacs has a lot of funny names.

* Elsewhere Maybe All Commands Simple

The file <i>etc/JOKES</i> in the Emacs distribution
contains a large number of these,
as well as a generous assortment
of other classical editor jokes.

<i>etc/JOKES</i> in the same directory as
the FAQ file. You'll also find
some other funny files there.)

'''Use of the Meta key'''

Emacs looks for Meta_L and Meta_R keysyms in the output of "xmodmap
-pm".  That will tell Emacs which modifier is the meta modifier.  From
then on, Emacs uses that modifier to mean meta.  If there are no
Meta_L and Meta_R keysyms in the output of "xmodmap -pm", Emacs looks
for Alt_L and Alt_R.  If these aren't there, either, you have to use
ESC.

I forgot to mention that other programs always use the mod1 modifier
for meta, regardless of the keysyms.
