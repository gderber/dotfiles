XEmacs has sokoban.el.  It works for Emacs as well.

On my Debian system, the XEmacs elisp files are gzipped, and the
sokoban data file is somewhere in the XEmacs tree.  Here's how I
install it in my ~/.emacs file:

 (auto-compression-mode 1)
 (setq sokoban-level-file "/usr/share/xemacs21/packages/etc/sokoban.levels")
 (autoload 'sokoban "/usr/share/xemacs21/packages/lisp/games/sokoban.el.gz" nil t)

== GNU Emacs Sokoban ==

sokoban in XEmacs has been ported to GNU emacs: https://github.com/leoliu/sokoban

There is a small sokoban by Sascha Wilde, written specifically for the GNU Emacs

* http://www.sha-bang.de/content/15_emacs/emacs-sokoban-0.14.1.tar.gz

If features color via fontification, system wide highscore and 50 levels.  New levels can be added very easily as they are plain text files.
