LogoMode is included in the tarball for BerkeleyLogo under the subdirectory ##emacs##.  It recognizes the syntax of Logo, implements its own AbbrevMode for syntax completion, and can send commands to a Logo interpreter buffer using ComintMode producing results in the buffer or in X11 frame spawned by UCB Logo.

Following the tutorial Logo file, ##tutorial.lg## is helpful for getting started with the mode's operations.

=== Update ===

It looks like the Emacs mode was removed from ucblogo 6, and previous versions aren't available on the project page.  I had to download it from the Debian Lenny archives:

<pre>
wget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/u/ucblogo/ucblogo_5.5.orig.tar.gz
tar xf ucblogo_5.5.orig.tar.gz
cp -r ucblogo-5.5/emacs/ ~/.emacs.d/logo
cp -r ucblogo-5.5/helpfiles/ ~/.emacs.d/logo/
cp -r ucblogo-5.5/docs/ ~/.emacs.d/logo/
</pre>

Then load logo-mode by putting the following in your Emacs config:

<pre>
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/logo")
(autoload 'logo-mode "logo")
(setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.lgo?$" . logo-mode)) auto-mode-alist))
(setq logo-binary-name "/usr/bin/logo")
(setq logo-tutorial-path "~/.emacs.d/logo/")
(setq logo-help-path "~/.emacs.d/logo/helpfiles/")
(setq logo-info-file "~/.emacs.d/logo/docs/ucblogo.info")
</pre>

<b>Warning</b>: It takes over your global Emacs font face configurations, so run it in a separate Emacs process.
