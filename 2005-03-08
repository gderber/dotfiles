On news:gnu.emacs.help, ThienThiNguyen is conducting an informal survey on
the blinking TextCursor in GnuEmacs. From his post:

 i'm following a thread wherein the participants discuss the blinking
 box cursor, visible w/ emacs under a windowing system. what follows
 is a personally-motivated survey (i'm curious), and DOES NOT represent
 views of emacs hackers, etc.  some of them may read your responses and
 act upon the answers, but that is NOT GUARANTEED.

If you are interested, you might want to join the discussion.
