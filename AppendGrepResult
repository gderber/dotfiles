Lisp:rgrep-append.el (AppendGrepResult)

provide a variant version of `rgrep' command with the ability to append the search result to previous ones using the same *grep* buffer.

If you get used to source insight way to handle the found result, you will find the similar way using the `rgrep' in the extension.

My first extension to emacs. -- JustinJiang
