Screen Term is an extension for running
[http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/ GNU Screen]
inside an emacs terminal.
It provides some functions for controlling screen that you can bind to
emacs keys, and gives the functionality of a tabbed terminal.

This is a first extension from an emacs newbie, feel free to improve.
