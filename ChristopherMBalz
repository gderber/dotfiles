I find Emacs to be the most effective way to manipulate the text files that underpin software development.  I feel that is not surprising, since it has been evolved by some of the best software engineers over many decades.

I'd like to see Emacs brought to a wider audience through improvements in ease of configuration.

More later!

Finally, thank you to all Emacs contributors and newsgroup/wiki posters who have made Emacs work for me over many thousands of hours of use.
