[[zeus]] has agreed to host a [https://svn.rizoma.cl/svn/emacswiki/ SVN repository] of the raw EmacsWiki pages.
This is, again, a one-way deal. It's just another way to WikiDownload, I guess.
I haven't thought this through, yet. So for the moment this is just a proof-of-concept
thing. A cron job runs [http://www.emacswiki.org/scripts/emacs-svn-update my little shell script]
every 24h to update the repository.
Right now pages with uploaded files (eg. [[TummePic01]]) are decoded before being checked in, but their names
are not changed. Thus, no suffix (such as .jpg) will be appended. I don't know whether that's good or bad.
