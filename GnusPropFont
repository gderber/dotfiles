gnus-propfont.el by OliverScholz displays articles in Gnus in a
proportional font. It is possible to define faces on a per-group
basis.  It is possible to define rules to _exclude_ certain parts of an
article from being "fontificated". So that -- for example -- code
snipplets are displayed in the default font and not in a proportional
font.

* Lisp:gnus-propfont.el

After putting the file into your LoadPath, add the following to your
~/.gnus file:

    (require 'gnus-propfont)
    (add-hook 'gnus-article-prepare-hook 'gpf-add-faces)
