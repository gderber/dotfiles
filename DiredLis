Emacs 23 has builtin [[IncrementalSearch|Isearch]] of filenames in [[DiredMode|Dired]]:

* `M-s f C-s' -- `dired-isearch-filenames': Isearch only among filenames.
* `M-s f C-M-s' -- `dired-isearch-filenames-regexp': Same, but [[regexp]] search.
* `M-s a C-M-s' -- `dired-do-isearch-regexp': Isearch the marked files.
