I found a great elisp function that dereferences Windows shortcuts using a vbscript in the background. I have uploaded Lisp:lnk.el (the comments in the source suggested that it was OK, feel free to bash me if I was a bad boy) but not run-command.el (no mentioning of GNU Emacs or anything like that in this source) but you can find it on google groups: 

http://groups.google.com/groups?q=run-command.el+1.13+group:gnu.emacs.sources

The following snippet is from my patched eshell/cd function, I have left two rows of code from the original function so that you know where to paste it (no, I'm not that familiar with how to make patches the "correct" way). Consider this version 0.1b:

<pre>
	    (setq handled t)))))
     ;; .lnk support begins here
     ;; Very basic handling of Windows shortcuts (.lnk files) to
     ;; directories. Requires lnk.el and run-command.el
     ((and (eq system-type 'windows-nt)
           path           
           (featurep 'lnk)
           (featurep 'run-command)
           (or (file-regular-p path)
               (file-regular-p (concat path ".lnk")))
           (setq path (lnk-dereference-shortcut 
                       (if (file-regular-p path)
                           path
                         (if (file-regular-p (concat path ".lnk"))
                             (concat path ".lnk")))))))
     ;; .lnk support ends here
     (path
</pre>

This change now allows eshell to grok commands like this:

 d:/home $ cd mp3
 c:/sound_and_gfx/mp3 $

or

 d:/home $ cd mp3.lnk
 c:/sound_and_gfx/mp3 $

where mp3.lnk is a Windows shortcut to c:\sound_and_gfx\mp3.

=== The vbscript ===

<pre>
