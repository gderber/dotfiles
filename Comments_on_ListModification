A list truncation example would be nice: truncate to the first ''n'' elements:

    (truncate-list n my-list)
    ==> ; potentially shortened list

Perhaps something like:

    (setq my-list '("one" "two" "three" "four" "five" "six" "seven" "eight" "nine"))
    (if (> (length my-list) 5)
        (setq my-list (subseq my-list 0 5))
      my-list)
    ==> ("one" "two" "three" "four" "five")
