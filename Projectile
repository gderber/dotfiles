=What is Projectile=
*Projectile* is a project interaction library for Emacs. Its goal is to provide a nice set of features operating on a project level without introducing external dependencies. For instance - finding project files is done in pure Emacs Lisp without the use of GNU find.

Projectile also tries to be practical - if some external tools could speed up some task substantially and the tools are available, Projectile will leverage them.

This library provides easy project management and navigation. The concept of a project is pretty basic - just a folder containing special file. Currently git, mercurial and bazaar repos are considered projects by default. If you want to mark a folder manually as a project just create an empty .projectile file in it. Some of projectile's features:

* jump to a file in project
* jump to a project buffer
* kill all project buffers
* replace in project
* multi-occur in project buffers
* grep in project
* regenerate project etags
* visit project in dired
* run make in a project with a single key chord

More information and installation instructions are available on [https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile GitHub].

= Work with ECB=
The following code will set ECB source path automatically using ##projectile-get-project-directories## 
{{{
(defvar default-ecb-source-path (list '("~/Documents/workspace" "Workspace")
								 '("~/" "~/")
								 '("/" "/")))

(add-hook 'ecb-basic-buffer-sync-hook
		  (lambda ()
			(when (functionp 'projectile-get-project-directories)
			  (when (projectile-project-p)
				(dolist (path-dir (projectile-get-project-directories))
				  (unless (member (list path-dir path-dir) default-ecb-source-path)
					(push (list path-dir path-dir) default-ecb-source-path)
					(customize-set-variable 'ecb-source-path default-ecb-source-path)
					))))))
}}}
