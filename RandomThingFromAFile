This is a quick piece of emacs lisp that will spit out a random line for a file.

This is good for fortune cookies, I Ching readings, Tips of the day, Daily Affirmations, etc.

  (defun enlightenment-for-today ()
    (interactive)
    (let* ((thing (random-thing-from-a-file "~/.discordia.txt")))
	   (message
	    (concat "Random Discordian Enlightenment. \n"
		    "===============================================\n"
		    thing))))

  
  (defun random-thing-from-a-file (f)
    (interactive "fLoad Thing from: ")
    (random t)
    (save-excursion
     (find-file f)
     (let ((line-num (random (count-lines (point-min) (point-max)))))
       (goto-line line-num)
       (let ((result (buffer-substring (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position))))
         (kill-buffer (current-buffer))
	 result))))

Enjoy

Also note the `cookie' function. The commentary in the source file says that
it works on files written in one of two formats:

* ITS-style LINS format (strings terminated by ASCII 0 characters,
  leading whitespace ignored).

* UNIX fortune file format (quotes terminated by %% on a line by itself).

Everything up to the first delimiter is treated as a comment.  Other
formats could be supported by adding alternates to the regexp
`cookie-delimiter'.
