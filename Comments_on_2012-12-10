Maybe we can have some manual mechanism similar to the one for deleting a page? A human marks a page as outdated, this gets visually indicated on the page and references to such pages are automatically aggregated somewhere, so they can be reviewed (and hopefully updated) by interested parties?

Theoretically, searching for CategoryNeedsAttention should do it, I guess? (Based on EmacsWikiContent.)
Nobody has used it, however. Having a button to quickly add this tag and an explanation might be something worth experimenting with.

If you now click on _Administration_, you should see a little form saying that the page "needs attention." If you submit a reason, CategoryNeedsAttention will be added to the page in question. When browsing a page, the code now checks for a match and if a match is found, a warning is displayed. In the default theme, that's a little paragraph at the top with pink background saying "This page needs attention."

What do you think? (Aside from the lack of [WikiPedia:Use%E2%80%93mention_distinction use-mention distinction].)

Sounds good to me.
