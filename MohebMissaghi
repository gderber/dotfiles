I like using Emacs as a powerful tool to complement MS' VisualStudio for rapid
development and productivity. I am a big fan of port of Emacs to Windows by
Jeoff Voelker.

== HTML Tag Highlighting ==

Here is a simple function which allows you to highlight what is in between html/xml tags:
<pre>
(defun mm-make-sgml-inner-tag-region ()
	(interactive)
	(if (or (eq major-mode 'html-mode)
					(eq major-mode 'sgml-mode))
			(progn
			(sgml-skip-tag-backward 1)
			(set-mark-command nil)
			(sgml-skip-tag-forward 1))
		(message "This command only works in html or sgml modes!")))
</pre>
Depending on where the cursor is, you'll get the entire stuff within tags highlighted. I bind this to a key for ease of use. 

== Symmetric Editing ==

Microsoft's Visual Studio allows source code pages to be edited by any editor
installed on the machine. I like this because it allows me to open a file in
Emacs and go across various directories (for example other projects) and cut
and paste stuff I'd done before. On the other hand VS gives you IntelliSense
which is critical in manipulating various objects (IntelliSense works similar
to file completion but on objects, i.e., it opens a little pop-up which gives
the developer all the properties and methods associated with a certain
object). However, there is one thing I don't like when switching back and force
between Emacs and VS which I describe in several steps:

* Open file f1.cs in VS.
* Check out the file from Visual SourceSafe.
* Do some editing.
* Save your edits.
* Open the same file in Emacs.
* Do some editing.
* Save the file in Emacs.
* Set focus to VS. This causes a dialog box to pop-up which notifies you that
the file is edited outside VS and if you'd like to reload it in VS. Accept
reload. 
* Do some editing in VS.
* Set focus on Emacs.
* Start editing. Emacs puts out the following:

<pre>
f1.cs changed on disk; really edit the buffer? (y, n, r or C-h) 
</pre>

The problem with this warning is that it happens a bit late to my taste,
meaning that I'd like a symmetric warning system. By this I mean that Emacs
should pop-up a dialog similar to VS which tells the user if the file
associated with the buffer is changed outside Emacs. This way, you can switch
between Emacs and VS by clicking ret and in each case you'll have the latest
file. If you like this here are the mods you have to do in w32fns.c:

* Put a static variable at the top so that this dialog doesn't become a
nuisanse:

<pre>
// put a static variable
static BOOL leaveBufferAlone = FALSE;
</pre>

* Put the following code under WM_SETFOCUS in w32_wnd_proc:

<pre>
case WM_SETFOCUS:
// see if file is changed
if (!NILP (current_buffer->filename)
    && SAVE_MODIFF >= MODIFF
    && NILP (Fverify_visited_file_modtime (Fcurrent_buffer ()))
    && !NILP (Ffile_exists_p (current_buffer->filename)))
  if (!leaveBufferAlone)          
    {
      int fileChangedDialogAnswer = MessageBox (NULL, "Buffer file changed on disk, revert?", "Emacs", MB_YESNO|MB_ICONQUESTION|MB_APPLMODAL|MB_SETFOREGROUND);
      char msg[80];
      
      if (fileChangedDialogAnswer == IDYES)
        {
          call3 (intern ("revert-buffer"), Qt, Qt, Qt);
          strcpy(msg, "File reverted: ");
          strcat(msg, XSTRING(current_buffer->filename)->data);    
          message (msg);
          leaveBufferAlone = FALSE;
      		SetFocus(hwnd);
        }
      else
        {
          strcpy(msg, "File changed on disk: ");
          strcat(msg, XSTRING(current_buffer->filename)->data);
          message (msg);
          leaveBufferAlone = TRUE;
      		SetFocus(hwnd);								
        }
    }
</pre>

* Compile.
