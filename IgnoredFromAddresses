If you want to list the recipient instead of the author for your own postings and mails, set `gnus-ignored-from-addresses'.  If you don't want to write the regexp yourself, use RegexpOpt:

    (setq gnus-ignored-from-addresses
      (regexp-opt 
       '("somename@company.com"
         "othername@comp.ch"
         "me@here.com"
         "metoo@here.ch"
         "otherme@klein.host.ac.at"
         "nobody@yahoo.com"
         "somebody@gmx.de")))
