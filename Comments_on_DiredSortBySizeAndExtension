=== Broken when sorting by extension, and probably others ===

Like all other dired sorting packages here, this extension fails when asked to sort by file extension on MacOS as the -X option 
is not supported by the <code>ls</code> command.  
The idea of relying on an external command to sort directory listings is an incredibly bad idea.  

If emacs must rely upon en external command to gather directory listings, it should require the least specific 
functionality that it can possibly get away with.  Requiring that <code>ls</code> support specific command switches is a 
very fragile solution that is likely to break.

Try DiredSortMenu. And use `ls-lisp'.
