Hey, my name is IsaacRaway. I'm a developer working mostly right now in web and a bit of windows programming. But, what is more important that what I do, is what I use: XEmacs 21.4 on Windows 2000. I also use a version of GnuEmacs compiled for Windows, but I'm moving to XEmacs almost exclusively.

Just sort of getting into the wiki thing now. I have my own wiki, but it is sad to say the least. I can't even bring myself to post the URL.

You can check me out at http://www.blueapples.org, though I don't really suggest it. The site is under a lot of fluctuation, and it just isn't real pretty. That's also my blog, when I actually make any entries.

Have fun and donÂ’t get hurt out there.

: Welcome to the wiki!  Me not being too curious, and you being so hesitant to talk about your web presence, I will not google for your name...  ;) -- AlexSchroeder
