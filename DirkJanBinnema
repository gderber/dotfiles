I'm Dirk-Jan C. Binnema (**djcb**), emacs user since '96 or so. Since that time, I'm gradually using emacs for more and more of my computer tasks. Ever since it exists, EmacsWiki has been a great resource -- even though some pages really need some cleanup (answered questions mixed with comments relating to outdated emacsen etc.), in the end it seems to work.

Some of my emacs related activities:
* [http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com EmacsFu] - my blog with emacs tricks/tips
* [[Sauron]] -  a little frame for tracking org-mode/ERC/dbus/... events.
* [http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu mu] - my email index/searcher; since 0.9.8 it includes an emacs-based e-mail client called [[mu4e]].

Happy hacking!
