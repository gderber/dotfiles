Lisp:tellicopy.el

This package has been replaced by [https://github.com/leoliu/easy-kill easy-kill.el] which is under active development and more polished. -- [[Leo]] on 2013-10-14

This code is directly copied out of my init file and the code has been
in intensive daily use with incremental improvements over some months
(~ 2 years).

Originally it was just a function that encompasses all the features I
want. It has been re-designed to make it easier to extend.

FEATURES:

1. M-w copies one of URL EMAIL or LINE; C-u 20 copies following 20
   lines; negative prefix is accepted as well.

2. M-w follow by one of the chars: l, f, w, s, d copies the
   corresponding thing at point as in `thing-at-point-alist'. For
   example, `M-w l' will copy the whole thing enclosed in parentheses,
   in LaTeX it also copies the whole inline formula at point if any.
   It accepts prefix too i.e. 'M-w 2 w' copies two words at point. For
   convenience 'C-u 2 M-w w' does the same.

I will develop the code to be reside in the tellicopy namespace later
on. -- Leo (2010-06-04)

Hi. I have moved the library to Lisp:tellicopy.el. You might also want to
provide a feature and comply to the ElispAreaConventions. -- JonasBernoulli
