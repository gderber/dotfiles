==About Me==

I use emacs 23.

My customizations to emacs have been growing steadily larger over time, and some of them are significant enough that I want to start sharing them.

Until I understand the organization of files around here, I'll just link to all my stuff from here. Feel free to add it to appropriate categories.

==My Code==

I have written or (more likely) contributed customizations to the following.

* ElscreenSeparateBufferLists -- A bit of code to add screen-specific buffer-lists to ELScreen.
* ProtBufByName -- ProtectingBuffers with certain names from being killed.
* DeskTop -- Overriding Stale Locks
* SystemTrash -- Make Emacs interoperate with GNOME and KDE's trash directories.
* EasyGlobalCommandRemapping -- A snippet of code to make it easy to replace command with other commands.
* RunWhenIdle -- A plan I have to provide a facility to repeatedly run a command in the background in an intelligent manner.

==Testing==

YaoddmuseTestLibraryUpload - I'm just using this to test yaoddmuse.el's upload facilities. So far I've figured out that if a page begins with ;;; Somename.el, then EmacsWiki magically turns it into an elisp source file. Cool.

YaoddmuseTestCreatingNewPage - There does not seem to be a way to follow a new link to create a page in Yaoddmuse. It seems like I have to create a local file and then M-x yaoddmuse-post-something-or-other it.
