[argyrodes] This module works great. I loaded the library and printed my perl code in color as easy as never before. 
No more saving ps buffer, open ghostview etc. At the begining I was worried about to loose the ps-printing entries
but I realized that this module doesn't print blindly but stops in the printer menu, so I can choose also my ps-printers 
or print to pdf with pdf-writer.
So Thanks for this easy-printing-colorfull module.

Just a note: I have been reading everything I have been able to find about printing under MS Windows before. Nothing worked for me before. (I do not know why, it may be something about the way the printers are setup on the network where I tested.)

w32-print no longer exists.  I believe that hfyview from nxhtml works, though.

I just found this and already love it; mostly for now being able to copy code for pasting into e-mails. I have couple of questions/requests:

# I use [http://www.emacswiki.org/LineNumbers#toc5 nlinum]. Any chance the generated can html can show the line numbers? 

# The formatted html does not look quite the same as my buffer, here's a screenshot of how it looks in my Emacs and in browsers

The important differences for me are that the browser has slightly smaller size and (I think) the small amount of space between lines is lost. I realize this might be property of browser configuration  but I am hoping you will know how to correct the situation

# Is it possible to extend styles so that changes to a basic style like <code>body</code> affects other styles like <code>span.constant</code>?

How do I print!  All I want to do is print with line number, syntex highlighting and proper word wrap.  This looks good but no where can I find what command to use once I have the stuff loaded!
