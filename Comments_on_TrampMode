"If Tramp still isn’t fast enough for you (or if you don’t use linux), try http://linux.com/feature/54498"...

But, that link is 404.

...I did not easily find a good replacement article.

I use Tramp Mode under Linux all the time.

You need a full PuTTY suite, with the plink utility for the interface.

I have found that for remote files using a file synchronization software like lsyncd [1] that monitors for changes in a local file tree and copies them to a remote host is another good alternative for Tramp. This way one can works with a local version of remote files using any local tool and have any changes almost instantly propagated to the remote host.

Here's a snippet that enables tramp filename completion in ssh shells.  When you ssh to a remote host in a shell, it will set comint-file-name-prefix which allows you to do filename completion and open files from your ssh shell in tramp.  I've been wanting this for a long time and finally took the time to write it:

{{{
(defun comint-ssh-file-name-prefix (output)
  "Set up filename completion via tramp in ssh shells.

Looks for shell commands like 'ssh -p port user@host' and sets
`comint-file-name-prefix' to '/ssh:user@host#port:'

Should be added to `comint-input-filter-functions' like so:

  (add-hook 'comint-input-filter-functions
            'comint-ssh-file-name-prefix)
  "

  (if (string-match ".*\\bssh\\b\\( +-p *\\(\\S-+\\)\\)? +\\(\\(\\(\\S-+\\)@\\)?\\(\\S-+\\)\\)" output)
      (let ((port (match-string 2 output))
	    (user-host (match-string 3 output)))
	(setq comint-file-name-prefix 
	      (concat "/ssh:" 
		      user-host
		      (if port (concat "#" port) "")
		      ":"))
	)))

(add-hook 'comint-input-filter-functions
	  'comint-ssh-file-name-prefix)
}}}
