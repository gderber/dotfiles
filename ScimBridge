== What is the SCIM? ==

[http://www.scim-im.org/ SCIM] is the Smart Common Input Method platform (SCIM) is an input method (IM) platform containing support for more than thirty languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean and many European languages) for POSIX-style operating systems including Linux and BSD.

== Installation ==

=== Install SCIM ===

: In Debian or Ubuntu, this is simple, like below:

        sudo aptitude install scim scim-bridge-agent -y

: If you use Chinese input method, you should install `scim-pinyin':

        sudo aptitude install scim-pinyin -y

=== Install scim-bridge.el ===

: Download newest version from [https://launchpad.net/scim-bridge.el scim-bridge.el project in Launchpad].

=== Disable XIM with Emacs ===

: Add below in ##~/.Xresources##:

        Emacs*useXIM: false

: And then execute command:

        xrdb ~/.Xresources

=== Add scim-bridge.el to load-path ===

: Unpack scim-bridge and put it under directory ##~/elisp##, then add the following to your ##~/.emacs##:

        (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))

=== Add another key to switch SCIM status ===

: Because Emacs binding keystone "Ctrl-Space" default. So i add another keystroke to switch SCIM input status, example, Super-Space.

: And put the following in your ~/.emacs:

        ;; Load scim-bridge.
        (require 'scim-bridge)
        ;; Turn on scim-mode automatically after loading .emacs
        (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'scim-mode-on)
        ;; Setup input status switch keystroke.
        (scim-define-common-key (kbd "s-SPC") t)
        ;; Use C-SPC for Set Mark command
        (scim-define-common-key (kbd "C-SPC") nil)
        ;; Use C-/ for Undo command
        (scim-define-common-key (kbd "C-/") nil)
        ;; Change cursor color depending on SCIM status
        (setq scim-cursor-color '("red" "blue" "limegreen"))
