== Compare regions within a buffer ==

You can compare regions within the same buffer by using ##M-x## ##ediff-regions-wordwise## or ##M-x## ##ediff-regions-linewise##. ediff will prompt you to select the buffer and regions you wish to compare.

Note that this will clear your open windows without warning. Turn [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WinnerMode|Winner Mode]] on first if you want to restore them afterward.
