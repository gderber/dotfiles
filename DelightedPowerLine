This library ensures that DelightedModes are displayed when PowerLine is used.

(Specifically delighted <em>major</em> modes, which otherwise will not display as intended.)

==Dependencies==

* delight.el version 1.04+
* powerline 1.0+

(I think this will be compatible with all of the powerline variants I've seen. -- [[Phil S]])

==Download==

Download the library from Lisp:delight-powerline.el

==Install==

Place the library somewhere in your Emacs load-path (or use ##M-x package-install-file## for the downloaded file), and add the following to your init file:

 (require 'delight-powerline)

Example:

 ;; Configure delighted modes
 (require 'delight)
 (delight 'emacs-lisp-mode "eLisp" :major)
 
 ;; Enable powerline
 (require 'powerline)
 (require 'delight-powerline)
 (powerline-default-theme)
