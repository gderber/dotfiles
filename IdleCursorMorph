I got annoyed that sometimes after I lost focus from my screen, I couldn't immediately find the cursor when I came back, which I otherwise prefer to have a non-disruptive look, so I thought "wouldn't it be neat if the cursor turned bright red or something after 20 seconds of inactivity?" And since this is Emacs, why not?

The implementation is simple, or even primitive if you will, and provides its own settings for the non-idle appearance instead of smartly saving existing settings each time it changes the appearance to the "idle" one. So it might override cursor-appearance settings coming from elsewhere. I had weird bugs when I tried to implement it the smart way and didn't have time to bother, so followed the simple approach. Improvements welcome.
