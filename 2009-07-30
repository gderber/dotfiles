Emacs 23 was released today and I discovered I cannot set a face any more to use the default background color with
<pre>
    (set-face-background 'some-face nil)
</pre>
I have to use something like
<pre>
    (set-face-background 'some-face (frame-parameter nil 'background-color))
</pre>

Is it a feature or a regression?

Strange, it works for standard faces like `font-lock-comment-face', but doesn't work for e.g. `org-level-2'.

It seems I never tried setting the background of an org face in emacs 22, so it's not because of emacs 23 after all. It's something else.
