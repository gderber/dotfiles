== Birny the Bot's Page ==

This page is devoted to the IRC bot, birny, who hangs out in channel <tt>#tcpip</tt> and channel <tt>#emacs</tt> on the freenode IRC network (http://www.freenode.net/).  Birny was written by FranLitterio, who is the current maintainer.  Birny is written in EmacsLisp and depends on ERC, the EmacsIRCClient.  You can find birny's source code at

Birny's cousin, ErBot, is also an EmacsLisp bot.  He was written by DeepakGoel.

=== How To Use Birny ===

To use birny, say something he recogizes in the channel.  You can speak privately to him using "<tt>/msg</tt>".  If you speak to him privately, he'll answer you privately, otherwise he'll answer in the channel.  Say something that has one of these forms:

: <tt>.command ...</tt>
: <tt>?word or phrase to lookup</tt>

The former is a command to birny to do something.  The latter is a request that birny lookup the definition of a word or phrase in his terminology database.  To get an index of terms in his database, use the "<tt>.index</tt>" command. Birny understands the following commands:

; <tt>.help [topic]</tt>: Show help for <i>topic</i>.  Type "<tt>.help ?</tt>" to see a list of all help topics.  This is the only command that does not require the leading "<tt>.</tt>", so you can type "<tt>help topic</tt>" and "<tt>help ?</tt>".

; <tt>.seen <i>nick</i></tt>: Report on the last time Birny saw the person with that nick do or say anything.

; <tt>.slashnews</tt>: Displays recent Slashdot headlines.

; <tt>.stats</tt>: Show statistics about the bot and his databases.

; <tt>.time <i>city-name</i></tt>: Show the time in the given city.

=== Feature Requests ===

These are features that would be nice:

* Per-channel terminology databases, so birny can serve more than one channel.
* A WHOIS lookup command (<tt>.whois</tt>).
** <tt>{xmb}</tt> and <tt>twkm</tt> are working on this.
* Support for DCC Chat.

=== Development "Things To Do" List ===

* Find a way to run birny in Emacs' batch mode.
