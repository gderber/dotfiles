=Synchronization=

If you are interested in a one time import or export from BBDB to some other contacts store format, you should see BbdbImporters and BbdbExporters. See B for simple import/export utilities. 

Synchronization, as distinct from the above, is a stateful bi-directional operation. This page talks about the software, utilities and general issues related to keeping your BBDB in sync with other PIM (personal information management) systems.

== ASynK ==

ASynK is a python program that performs bi-directional synchronization for Contacts, and works between MS Outlook, MS Exchange, CardDAV servers, Google Contacts, and Emacs BBDB. The project page is at: http://asynk.io/ As of January 2015 the software is under active development. Check out the project website for more information on finding the source, the asynk-users mailing list, announcements, and more.

==PalmPilot==

Although the Palm handheld products are more or less dead now, they had their share of fame, and in its heyday, the Palm had multiple working bi-directional sync utilities for BBDB!

* SyncBBDB by ThomasDeWeese -- Supports BBDB 2.2 and later. ie. file format 6 (recommended on the mailing list), but has dropped off the net.  The source code can still be found in Debian, however, at http://packages.debian.org/stable/source/syncbbdb

* http://www.neilvandyke.org/bbdbpalm/ by NeilVanDyke -- BBDBpalm was developed with BBDB 1.51 (outdated!) (It has also been reported to work with BBDB 2.00.02. -- also outdated)

==General==

Be sure to search the [http://www.mail-archive.com/bbdb-info@lists.sourceforge.net/ BBDB Info mailing-list archives] for the latest stuff.

===CardDAV===

CardDAV is a IETF standards-track protocol designed from the ground up for keeping PIM clients in sync with a contacts server. It has emerged as the most generic and open standard for contacts synchronization. Apple Addressbook can connect to a CardDav server for synchronisation. Gmail can act as a contacts server (you can think of the contacts UI in gmail as google's CardDAV client). CardDAV is based on vCard format for storing individual contact information.

ASynK (http://asynk.io/) supports bidirectional BBDB ‚ü∑ CardDAV (at least with BBDB3). See also the github page (https://github.com/skarra/ASynK/). ASynK has been reported to work with the following standalone CardDAV server implementations: OwnCloud, Baikal, Apple CalendarServer
