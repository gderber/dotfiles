I wonder how many people would be interested in a personal wiki on emacswiki.org -- much like my own: http://www.emacswiki.org/alex.  If people are interested, I could talk to my webhosting providers and see what they think of it.  No shell, no ftp, no email, not even email redirection, however. -- AlexSchroeder
