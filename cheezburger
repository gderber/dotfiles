cheezburger lets you easily view http://www.icanhascheezburger.com without leaving Emacs.

Obligatory Image (Using version 1.1):

Default key bindings:

* n: next image

* P: goto page #
* b: browse to post (with browse-url)
* u: copy the url of the blog post to the kill ring

Other things to note:
* Requires [http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/emacs/lisp/json.el?root=emacs json.el] (Which is part of EmacsFromCVS)
* I'm not responsible for lost productivity
* I will however take credit for a small portion of the fun you have while using it :-)
