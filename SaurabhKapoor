I'm Saurabh Kapoor and I live in India. I did my undergraduate studies
in Mathematics and am currently studying Computer Science at Pune University, India.
(http://cs.unipune.ernet.in). I go by the nick of esskay on #emacs.



I use Emacs.


I'm a regular visitor to this Wiki and most of what I've learnt about
emacs, I've picked up from here - right from w3m, eshell, erc, vm,
emacs-wiki, planner etc. etc.. This wiki, I feel, is the <em>best</em> resource
on emacs on the web. 


I've been using emacs for a year and a half now. The EmacsManual says
Emacs is "extensible and customizable". I've pretty much mastered the
'customizing' phase right now, but I have yet to learn properly the
'extending' part of it.


: Welcome to the wiki! I used Emacs for a long time before actually writing code for it.  The EmacsLispIntro was what got me started...  :) -- AlexSchroeder
