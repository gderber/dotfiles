One way to recognize sentence fragments, in addition to full [[Sentences]],
is with this crude solution.

  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (setq sentence-end-double-space nil)
              (when (string-match "^\\[" sentence-end-base)
                (setq sentence-end-base
                      (replace-match "--\\|[,;/" t t sentence-end-base)))))

Now, hitting `M-a' or `M-e' will It disables finding sentences when
they end with double spaces.

  The following paragraph has some example sentences in it. This is a
  sentence; but with two clauses. This says something -- includes
  something related -- but then ends. Then we list one, two and a
  third thing. In poetry/ one could/ use slashes/ to represent pauses.

The complete version that you could put in your InitFile.

  (eval-after-load "text-mode"
    '(add-hook 'text-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (eval-after-load "paragraphs"
                   '(progn
                      (setq sentence-end-double-space nil)
                      (when (string-match "^\\[" sentence-end-base)
                        (setq sentence-end-base
                              (replace-match "--\\|[,;/" t t sentence-end-base))))))))
