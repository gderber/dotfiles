When developing anything for the web, the most common workflow for me is to edit something in a file, save it, then switch to the browser and hit F5 to reload the current page to inspect the results of my changes. I always wanted to have a shortcut for this but never succeeded remote controlling firefox. Now I'm using chromium and finally managed to set it up.

Below are the steps needed to get a command save-and-reload, bound to C-x C-r (meant to be close to C-x C-s). It is heavily depending on my custom setup and won't work out of the box for you, but maybe it's still useful. Please improve if you want. 

Launch chromium (or google chrome) with enabled debug port:

google-chrome --remote-shell-port=9222

Get the chrome_remote_shell package from here:

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/chrome_remote_shell/

Create a little python program called chrome-reload that looks like this:

  #!/usr/bin/env python2
  import chrome_remote_shell

  shell = chrome_remote_shell.open(port=9222)

  response = shell.request('DevToolsService', command='list_tabs')
  tabs = response['data']
  first_tab = tabs[0]
  tab_id = first_tab[0]

  shell.request('V8Debugger', destination=tab_id, command='evaluate_javascript', data="window.location = window.location;")

And then the following code in .emacs:

  (defun save-and-reload () "Save and reload browser" (interactive)
    (save-buffer)
    (shell-command "chrome-reload")
    (shell-command "stumpish 'gselect 4'")
  )
  (define-key global-map "\C-x\C-r" 'save-and-reload)

The 'stumpish' command is to remote control the excellent stumpwm window manager that I am using. You may need to replace it with something else.

Update: chrome_remote_shell seems to only work with python 2, not python 3. If someone knows an easier, better supported way to remotely trigger a reload, please fill in!
