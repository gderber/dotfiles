Talcum is a minor mode that provides additional features for editing LaTeX files.

=== Features: ===

* uncluttering, as currently provided by unclutter.el, 
i.e. replace footnotes by 1, refs by ->, 
spacing commands with ordinary whitespace etc. in your Emacs buffer.
* new insertion commands that take you to the preamble 
(or a seperate command definition file) for \newcommands etc.
* prodding, i.e. automatic refresh of xdvi, xpdf etc. after compilation, 
sending the emacs frame to the bottom (to make room for the previewer's window), etc.
* selecting chapters for \includeonly via menu
* improved minibuffer completion
