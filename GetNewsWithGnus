== Server ==

Set the environment *NNTPSERVER* to the news server or write your news server name to **/etc/nntpserver**.
Or you can also use Gnus select methods:

 (setq gnus-select-method '(nntp "my.news.server"))

You can also use your local spool:

 (setq gnus-select-method '(nnspool "system-name"))

Note: First configure your <code>nnspool-*</code> variables.

If you want the use *more than one server*, place them into the variable <code>gnus-secondary-select-methods</code>.

If your news server required *username and password*, you should create the ~/.authinfo file. See GnusAuthinfo for more.

== Start Gnus And Subscribe ==

Then type <code>M-x gnus</code> to invoke Gnus, and then type L to list groups.

If you get the message *No news is no news*:

# Does `A k' show a list of groups?  Hit `u' on the ones you like.
# If `A k' doesn't do the trick, try `A z'.  Use `u' as above, but `C-k' on the ones you don't want.
# If that still doesn't do it, try `A A'.

Or an alternative using the *Server* buffer:

From the *Group* buffer, type `^'.  You are now in the server buffer.  There, move point to the server name you are trying to read, hit SPC.  You should see a listing of all groups that the server has to offer.  Search for the group you want.  Hit, `u' on it.  Then, hit q q and you should be back at the *Group* buffer.  Point should also be on the selected group.  Now, hit `g' to retrieve news.  Then hit SPC to enter the group and have at it.

[new]
Is there any way to make Gnus pass through an HTTP proxy?
