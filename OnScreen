Scrolling can be distracting because your eyes may lose  orientation.  This library implements a minor mode that highlights the previously visible buffer part after each scroll.  This is nice when you read larger texts in Emacs, like Emails in Gnus or webpages in w3m.

There are different highlighting methods available, from unintrusive fringe markers to transparent overlays.
You can use different configurations for different modes by making variables buffer local - see the Commentary section of the header.

This library was inspired by a similar feature of the "Conqueror" web browser.
