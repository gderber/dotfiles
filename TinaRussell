== About me ==

I discovered Emacs in late 2017, upon realizing that I had grown to hate computing and heard of a strange alternate timeline called the “Lisp Machines” whose users are as prolifically brilliant as they are stubbornly idiosyncratic. This timeline collapsed long ago—or so the world thought, but it lived on in the one, struggling survivor called Emacs, limping through the city and mumbling to passersby about how great it is to open a web browser in your text editor. Naturally, I had to attach myself to this endearingly lost cause.
