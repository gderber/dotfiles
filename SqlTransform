 sql-transform.el --- transform SQL statements

I often write SQL statements for application dialogs using SqlMode.  Usually, I need a select statement, an insert statement, an update statement, and a delete statement for every dialog box.  The following elisp code allows me to write a simple select statement and generate inserts and updates from it.

Note that this code still needs improvements; I'm interested in any feedback.  Points that need improvement: handling of missing information, better identification of start and end of SQL statements.

You can get it here: Lisp:sql-transform.el
