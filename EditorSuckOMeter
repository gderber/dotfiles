From the site:

: The data are updated weekly. If you want to publicly express your opinion about a particular editor, don't write me; go to news:comp.editors instead... Be sure to include "sucks" or "rules" into your posting subject line so that a typical newsreader setup can treat your message accordingly. ;-)
