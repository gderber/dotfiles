[http://www.s48.org/ Scheme48] is an implementation of the programming
language [[Scheme]]. This mode is an extension to the normal
SchemeMode and provides specific interactions with Scheme48. This
means that expressions evaluated with C-x C-e etc. will be evaluated
in the correct package (a module, in the Scheme48 world)
automatically.

This mode is a successor to cmuscheme48.el which comes with Scheme48.
