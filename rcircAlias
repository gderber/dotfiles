[https://github.com/kensanata/elisp/blob/master/rcirc-alias.el rcirc-alias.el] is an incomplete extension for [[rcirc]]. It allows you to rename nicks and merge them -- treating multiple nicks as a single person.

Currently implemented:

* User-interface using an ##/ALIAS## command.
* The list of names returned by ##/NAMES## is munged appropriately.

Todo:

* Make sure nicks are only used in a single alias when defining them.
* Use a defcustom for rcirc-alias.
* Allow TAB completion for aliases.
* Transparently translate any aliases used to the appropriate nick based on current server.
* Provide a command to remove nicks (remove a nick when it is prefixed by a minus).
