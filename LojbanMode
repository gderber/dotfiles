This is a minor mode for text in lojban (a constructed language).

It includes syntactical highlighting for lojban words: the three basic word types (cmavo, cmene, and brivla) and some attitudinal indicators are highlighted with different faces.

As an experimental feature, there is specialized support for outline-mode using headers in valid lojban.
