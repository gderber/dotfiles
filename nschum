My real name is Nikolaj Schumacher.  I've been an Emacs user since 2004.
Currently I use GNU Emacs on a !MacBook Pro with a modified Dvorak layout. 

== Packages ==
I'm a customization junkie.  My collected .emacs is a few hundred kilobytes in size ...
I've released a lot of it as packages on my [http://nschum.de/src/emacs/ website].

Welcome.  I've only started to try your `kill-ring-search' package, but it absolutely rocks!  It's much lighter-weight than `browse-kill-ring' while sparing me the visual grep through repeated "C-y" / "C-_".  -- SeanO
