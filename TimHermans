I started using Emacs maybe 7 years ago.  Heavily about 3 years ago. 

I am also known as [::thermans].

I use both GNU Emacs and XEmacs but most recently have been gravitating more towards GNU Emacs.

I must admit I'm only now coming to be confident in my understanding of emacsen.
Got my init files customized just right, although I fiddle with them constantly.  

What power!  What grace!  I love it!
