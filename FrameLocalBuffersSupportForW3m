== Frame-Local Buffers Support for Emacs-w3m ==

With this mode switched on, W3M buffers are associated with the [[Frame]] on which
they were created.  See the code Lisp:w3m-fb.el.

Only tabs for the current frame's W3M buffers are shown (with
<code>non-nil</code> <code>w3m-use-tab</code>); other affected commands are
`w3m-next-buffer', `w3m-previous-buffer', `w3m-select-buffer' and `w3m-quit'.

Switch the mode on programmatically with:

    (w3m-fb-mode 1)

or toggle interactively with <code>M-x w3m-fb-mode RET</code>.
