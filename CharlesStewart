After using Emacs almost religiously for academic and professional coding projects, I began to realize it's utility in more personal aspects.  After Googling up some mailing list posts by RaymondZeitler, I installed PlannerMode via apt-get and now I'm a convert!

I am currently scheduled to become an alumnus from Southern Polytechnic State Univerty ( online at http://www.spsu.edu/ ) and I am a registered member of the Association of Computing Machinery.
