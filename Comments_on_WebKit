It need PyQt5 and Python-EPC, it possible to build those depend on non-linux platform, but i just test it on Linux.

When I try  to load the file webkit.el into emacs I get the following error message:

Loading  /my/path/webkit/webkit.el (source)...
load-with-code-conversion: Symbol's value as variable is void: <!DOCTYPE
user-error: Minibuffer window is not active

What does this error message mean? I also am having some trouble installing the prerequisite libraries on Fedora 19:

PyQt5:        not tried yet, should this be in yum or do I really have to install it from http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro

Python-Xlib: I got it from yum install python-xlib.noarch  

Python-EPC:  I downloaded it from https://github.com/tkf/python-epc, got hold of pip and ran sudo pip install epc. it claimed success

At his point I still get the error referred to at the top of this message.

UPDATE: I also installed  72 Packages (+7 Dependent packages) with the command yum install "qt5*". Same error message.

UPDATE2: I have now compiled PyQt5 and make-install'ed it. Still same error message when loading webkit.el.

UPDATE3: github website had given me the html instead of py files, hence the error. Webkit.el loads, next test the browser...

UPDATE4: I did M-X webkit-open-url , entered http://www.google.com , a buffer came up but the wepage is not showing.
There is a process /bin/python /my/path/webkit/browser.py running, but it uses little cpu if any.
There is a minibuffer status message  that says 

Focus view: "e890abd1-1c97-4b29-9c9d-d842ddf56d62"

If I try kill-buffer on the relevant buffer, I get the error message  "Process epc con 3 not running". I also cannot exit emacs normally, becaie I get thjat same messgae. Emacs has to be shut down with a kill -9 PID command.

Any ideas for me?

Does this package allow me to copy text, search for regexp's, etc. on the webpage?

Buffer doesnt render anything for me either and can't kill buffer, getting: “Process epc con 3 not running”
