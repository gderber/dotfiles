This is the place for guidelines and existing coding practices for EmacsLisp files on EmacsWiki pages (the ElispArea).

Guidelines that say "'''should'''" are paraphrased from the EmacsLispReference. Text in angle brackets (<code><</code>, <code>></code>) is exemplary only -- replace it with your text. Note, in particular, the difference between lines that start with <code>;;;</code> and lines that start with <code>;;</code>. Three semi-colons indicate ''major'' file sections.

The major section headings are, in order:

* <code>;;; <name>.el --- <one-line description of the library></code>
* <code>;;; Commentary:</code>
* <code>;;; Change Log:</code> (optional)
* <code>;;; Code:</code>
* <code>;;; <name>.el ends here</code>

Here are descriptions of all commonly used (or proposed) sections:

* The file should start with <code>;;; <name>.el --- <one-line description of the library></code>. This should contain the same description as the <code>;; Description:</code> field, if that exists. The filename should be the same as the <code>;; Filename:</code> field. Both <code>;; Description:</code> and <code>;; Filename:</code> are considered obsolete.
* The file should contain a copyright notice, unless you want to put it in public domain. Use message like this: <code>;; Copyright (C) <YEAR> <NAME> <EMAIL></code> -- for example, <code>;; Copyright (C) 2000-2005  J. Random Hacker <address@example.com></code> or <code>;; Copyright (C) 2000-2005  J. Random Hacker <address@example.com>, all rights reserved.</code>. Copyright could be granted to organization, for example <code>Free Software Foundation, Inc.</code>. If there are more than one copyright holders, list them separated by commas.
* The author or authors (at least the principal ones) and the current maintainer of the library should be noted, using <code>;; Author:</code> and <code>;; Maintainer:</code>. Those fields should state the name, and they can also indicate the net address, if appropriate. For example <code>;; Maintainer: Joe Hacker <address@example.com></code>. If there are multiple authors, you can list them on continuation lines led by `<code>;;</code>' and a tab character (use `<code>C-q TAB</code>' to insert it).
* To check if the file on the wiki changed from the version downloaded, the following convention can be followed -- modify the following fields:

** <code>;; Last-Updated: <date in UTC, or with timezone present></code>
** <code>;;           By: <name of modifier></code>
** <code>;;     Update #: <counter incremented after each update></code> -- successive Wiki updates need not have successive update numbers).

:: These fields can be automatically updated by using Lisp:header2.el -- see AutomaticFileHeaders.
* Other common fields include:
** <code>;; Created: <creation date></code>, for example <code>14 Jul 1992</code>
** <code>;; Version: <library version></code>, for example <code>1.11</code>
** <code>;; Keywords: <M-x finder-list-keywords>, separated by commas></code>. This line lists keywords for the help command `finder-by-keyword' (see FinderByKeyword).
** <code>;; URL: <location of the file></code> -- use <code>http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/name.el</code> or <code>http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs/download/name.el</code> if you want to host it here
** <code>;; Compatibility: <target Emacs versions></code> and <code>;; Incompatibility:</code>
* *Proposition* -- Use <code>;; EmacsWiki:</code> (EmacsWiki page that describes the library). For example, this would be <code>;; EmacsWiki: OccurBuffer</code> for Lisp:color-moccur.el (OccurBuffer). A good place for this is just after <code>;; URL</code>.
* A description of the library and how to use it should be entered under <code>;;; Commentary:</code>. Sometimes, the <code>Commentary</code> section is divided into <code>;; Installation:</code> and <code>;; Description:</code>.
* If you store change log information in the elisp file, you should begin it with <code>;;; Change Log:</code>.
* You can add the [[GPL]] boilerplate somewhere -- typically, it appears before <code>;;; Code:</code>.
* If you like, you can add <code>;; This file is *NOT* part of GNU Emacs.</code>, or <code>;; This file is part of GNU Emacs.</code>, or <code>;; This file is part of XEmacs.</code>, as appropriate. If present, this appears typically before <code>;;; Code:</code>.
* The actual code should be in section <code>;;; Code:</code>
* The file should end with <code>;;; <name>.el ends here</code>. The final full stop is optional.

FWIW, the EmacsLispReference suggests for files contributed to GNU (Info node `Emacs Lisp Coding Conventions'):

: *Please keep the names of your Emacs Lisp source files to 13 characters or less.*  This way, if the files are compiled, the compiled files' names will be 14 characters or less, which is short enough to fit on all kinds of Unix systems.

Relying on case in filenames is not a very good idea, either. Sure, it works on UNIX:ish systems, but not in Windows.
