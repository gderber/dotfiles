OK, now I've figured out the whole enchilada!  I think this would be
quite useful for finding Windows API help as well (which is always
painful), just change `tcl-mode-hook' to `c-mode-common-hook', and
find the right help file.

`find-tag-default' is defined in etags.

 (require 'etags)
 (defun tcl-help ()
   (interactive )
   (shell-command 
    (concat "c:/winnt/winhlp32 -k " 
	    (find-tag-default)  
	    " D:/Program Files/Tcl/doc/tcl83.hlp &")))

 (defun my-tcl-mode-hook ()
   (local-set-key [f1] 'tcl-help))

 (add-hook 'tcl-mode-hook 'my-tcl-mode-hook)


Also, http://www.tertius.com/projects/library/emacs.html you can find "w32-dev-env" which provides some relevant functionality.
