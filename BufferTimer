== Overview ==

*buffer-timer* is a utility to keep track of the time spent in a series
of emacs buffers.  You can then collectively group buffers into tasks
and thus keep track of your overall time spent per project, for
example.

== Using it ==

Define your categories in a hierarchical manner:

<pre>
(require 'buffer-timer)

; Example list of titles and regexps to group by.  This
(setq buffer-timer-regexp-master-list
  '(
    ("idle" . 
     (("generic" .			  "^\\*idle\\*")
      ("generic2" .			  "^\\*idle-2\\*")
      ("minibuf" .                        "^ \\*Minibuf-.*")))
    ("personal" .
     (("reading" .                        "lib/ebooks/")
      ("photography" .                    "images/capturedonearth")))
    ("work" .
      (("rocket engine project" .
        (("docs" .                        "src/rocket.*org")
         ("code" .                        "src/rocket.*\\(cpp\\|h\\)$")
         ("generic" .                     "src/rocket")))
       ("world peace" .
        (("project planning" .            "src/worldpeas/TODO")
         ("implementation" .              "src/worldpeas")))))
     ))
</pre>

And then start editing like you normally would!  At the end of the day, type /C-c t m/ to get a summary of your time spent matched to the hierarchy.

== Getting It ==

== History ==

Version 0.5, released in July 2011 is really the first version that works well on Emacs.

Originally written for XEmacs, with a pretty "top (gutter) bar" it has
since migrated to Emacs where it still is missing some of the original
functionality.  The button code and "top bar" functionality needs to
be rewritten entirely.  The summary, in XEmacs, used to be a nicely navigable tree before
the functionality was lost in the rewrite.
