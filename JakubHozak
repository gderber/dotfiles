For those using Emacs to develop RoR applications and run their tests by Autotest, here is a neat trick how to run test without need of actual changing and saving the buffer: 

{{{
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-c t") '(lambda () 
                                     (interactive) 
                                     (set-buffer-modified-p 1) 
                                     (save-buffer))) 
}}}
