==Overview==

Web browsing helpers for OS X.

==Quickstart==

    (require 'osx-browse)

    (osx-browse-mode 1)

    ⌘-b      ; browse to URL in foreground
    C-- ⌘-b  ; browse to URL in background

    ⌘-i      ; search Google in foreground
    C-- ⌘-i  ; search Google in background

    ;; position cursor on a URL
    ⌘-b

    ;; select a region
    ⌘-i

    ;; to turn off confirmations
    (setq browse-url-dwim-always-confirm-extraction nil)

==Explanation==

This package helps Emacs run Safari, Google Chrome, and Firefox
on OS X.  It uses `browse-url', but is somewhat more friendly and
configurable than the OS X functions provided there.

Default values for URLs or search text are deduced from the region
or from context around the point, according to the heuristics in
BrowseUrlDwim.

To use osx-browse, place the osx-browse.el library somewhere
Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'osx-browse)
    (osx-browse-mode 1)

The following interactive commands are provided:

    `osx-browse-mode'
    `osx-browse-url'
    `osx-browse-search'
    `osx-browse-guess'
    `osx-browse-url-safari'
    `osx-browse-url-chrome'
    `osx-browse-url-firefox'

When `osx-browse-install-aliases' is set (the default) and
`osx-browse-mode' is turned on, aliases are added for the commands

    `browse'
    `google'
    `browse-url-chromium'

==Notes==

This library uses BrowseUrlDwim, but does not require that
`browse-url-dwim-mode' be turned on.  If both modes are turned
on, keybindings from both modes will be active.

When `osx-browse-mode' is turned on, `browse-url-browser-function'
is set to `osx-browse-url', meaning that your default browsing
facilities will be provided by this library.  `osx-browse-url-safari'
and friends are provided in the event that you wish to set
`browse-url-browser-function' by hand.

==Bugs==

Keybindings don't work out of the box with Aquamacs, which
does not think that ⌘ is the Super modifier.

OS X makes an iconified application visible, even when opening
a URL in the background.
