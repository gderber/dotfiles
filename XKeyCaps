<nowiki>XKeyCaps</nowiki> is a graphical tool by JamieZawinski that
allows one to click on a picture of one's keyboard and manipulate the
keysyms and modifier bits associated with one's keys in real time.
When you're done, <nowiki>XKeyCaps</nowiki> can generate an XModMap
input file so that you can persist your key rebindings at startup.
This is interesting for Emacs users, since we are some of the last X
users who actually care about modifier keys other than "shift" and
"control."

In addition to allowing you to ignore XModMap (certainly a benefit),
<nowiki>XKeyCaps</nowiki> also prevents you from committing all kinds
of common sins with your keymap.  For example, it will warn you if you
try to assign a modifier bit to a key that generates an incompatible
keysym, if you try to assign the same modifier bit to keys with
semantically different keysyms, etc.

You can download a copy of the source code at
http://www.jwz.org/xkeycaps/, although users of FreeSoftware operating
systems will probably have binary packages available to them.

A tutorial on keysyms, keycodes, modifier bits, etc. is
contained in the [http://www.jwz.org/xkeycaps/man.html#7
XKeyCaps manual page].  If you have never dealt with the X keyboard
model before, it's an entertaining bit of information.  By
"entertaining" I mean "nauseating," and by "information" I mean
"indescribable pain."

Note that there hasn't been a new release of <nowiki>XKeyCaps</nowiki>
since 1999, and JamieZawinski has officially orphaned the
project.  That said, one shouldn't have a problem with the 1999 version
of the program, excepting possibly
some new, impossibly eccentric keyboard.
