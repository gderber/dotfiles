The thread on GTK Emacs and Gnome on emacs-devel continues.
Some people have complained that results are unpredictable when customizing the colors of scroll-bars in GTK Emacs.  Jan D. said that this depends on the theme used: Pixmap themes prevent color customizations.  So now the debate turns to this question:

JanD asks:

: I am more leaning towards removing all customability in the GTK
version of Emacs.  Mainly because the mechanisms used are not well
documented in GTK, they have confusing effects depending on what theme
you use, but perhaps the most important argument, GTK/Gnome has stated
that the only customization they really support is by themes.

: One of the reasons to have GTK in the first place is to get a
consistent look-and-feel with other GTK/Gnome applications (granted
Emacs uses different icons).  If customizations are needed, we can
recommend another toolkit.

MilesBader replies:

: I think it's perfectly fine to resist, and the more vocally the better.
The Gnome team is perfectly free to ignore such entreaties, but they should
at least be aware that people don't like the directions they're going in.

On a related note, JanD also introduced a new function that might be of interest:

: I have made a function that can work as a base for implementing a
package for extended window manager hints (EWMH).  However, I am
currently only able to do Emacs stuff during weekends (traveling during
the week), so I have just made a client event sending function you can
use.  For example, to set fullscreen with EWMH, do:

    (x-send-client-message nil 0 nil "_NET_WM_STATE" 32
                           '(2 "_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN" 0))
