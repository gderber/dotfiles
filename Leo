I use Emacs. I started using GNU Emacs emacs-unicode-2 branch somewhere in Dec. 2005 for emails and TeX/LaTeX documents. [2010-02-10] These days I am running Emacs 64bit on Snow Leopard. It is handling over 80% of my computing tasks, reliably and efficiently. See https://github.com/leoliu for the full list of my elisp packages.
