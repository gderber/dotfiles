`dired-listing-switches' says that `-l' is mandatory.

Here's a function to hide everything up to the filename:

{{{
(defun dired-hide-crap ()
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (let ((start (point))
	  (inhibit-read-only t))
      (while (let ((end (next-property-change (point))))
	       (when end
		 (goto-char end)))
	(when (plist-get (text-properties-at (point)) 'dired-filename)
	  (put-text-property start (point) 'invisible t)
	  (forward-line 1)
	  (setq start (point)))))))

(add-hook 'dired-after-readin-hook 'dired-hide-crap)
}}}

For a fancier implementation, see DiredDetails.
