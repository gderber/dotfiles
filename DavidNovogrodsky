My home page is http://www.novogrodsky.net

Also, I am interested in starting a project. I want to create an emacs add-on that allows a user to save a buffer to a !JavaSpace and allows a user to search a !JavaSpace for objects. Any takers?

: Welcome to the wiki!  I don't even know what a Java Space is...  And I don't use Java outside the office.  ;)  Very nice pics on your page about climbing Mt. Mulanje in Malawi! -- AlexSchroeder
