I am 

* a biologist using emacs since Summer 2009.
* derele on #emacs
* blogging on [http://www.scienceblogs.de/alles-was-lebt/] (in German, together with a second author: Alex)

I use emacs mainly for 

* bioinformatics in perl ([http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CPerlMode cperl-mode], [http://obsidianrook.com/perlnow/emacs_as_perl_ide.html perlnow] and [http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Emacs bioperl-mode])
* statistics and bioinformatics in R ([http://ess.r-project.org/ emacs-ess])
* LaTeX (well... most the commonly used packages)


I keep track of my emacs customisation on [http://github.com/derele/dotemacs Github] (through [http://zagadka.vm.bytemark.co.uk/magit/ magit])


Motivation

I started programming Perl and R less than two years ago for my
Phd-thesis involving Bioinformatics. I switched to Linux for that
reason, ... well switchted is probably wrong: Before that I was not
really interested in computers. Since then coding somehow infected my
mind. Using the most advanced tool was only a small step from there
like getting into elisp from my fiddling with my .emacs is.

I started a week ago to write my first own mode it is great how
much that cleared some of my understanding of Emacs.
I would much appreciate comments on it, here it is:
