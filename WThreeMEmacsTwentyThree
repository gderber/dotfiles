Information Specific to Emacs23

For a while, there were problems reported about using emacs-w3m in emacs version 23, but as of 2007-05-09,
the current CVS version works out of the box (per ZedLopez).

If you installed w3m from a package in emacs 22, you might need to recompile the bytecode, as bytecode compiled by GnuEmacs 22 is not compatible with GnuEmacs 23

===Not working with Emacs 23 and emacs-w3m from the CVS ?===

With Emacs 23 from the CVS the follow code can help you to use Emacs23
and Emacs22 without any problem

<pre>
(if (= emacs-major-version 23)
	(require 'w3m-ems)
  (require 'w3m))
</pre>

This will load w3m-ems which is the proper package to load with the
latest version of emacs-w3m from the CVS.

===Avoiding Some Problems with emacs-23 and emacs-w3m from cvs===

* build emacs-23 and then make sure it is the first emacs found in your $PATH. by typing "which emacs", you can find out which emacs the system finds first


* this is important since you want to build emacs-w3m from cvs <b>with emacs23</b>, not with emacs22 if it is also installed on your system. if you compile it with emacs22, it won't work in emacs23.

here is the .emacs snippet i use to load w3m (note your installation path may be different):

<pre>
(if (= emacs-major-version 23)
    (progn
      (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.el/emacs-w3m/share/emacs/site-lisp/w3m")
      (require 'w3m-load))
  (require 'w3m))
</pre>

if you don't know how to force your system to find emacs23 first, try:

<pre>
export PATH=/path/to/emacs23:$PATH
</pre>


as of june 16, 2008, this works

===Emacs 23 from CVS and W3M in Debian - Internationalization and code pages===

RichardRiley, 20 Oct 2008.

What fixed it for me in Debian was to uninstall the w3m package and install w3mmee. All internationalization then worked. Load w3m in the normal manner.

In a shell:

<pre>
sudo apt-get remove w3m
sudo apt-get install w3mmee w3mmee-img
</pre>

Load w3m in the normal manner. Thanks to Andy Stewart for help via email and in the #emacs irc channel.

If you use debian sid or testing you will not have w3mmee and w3mee-img but you can install w3m-el-snapshot.

===w3m in Emacs 23 (on Debian and Ubuntu 9.10)===

The `w3m-el' package is not fully compatible with Emacs 23. Installing `w3m-el-snapshot' instead worked for me. No additional setup like ##(require 'w3m-load)## was necessary.

<pre>
sudo aptitude install w3m-el-snapshot
</pre>

If you already have `w3m-el', it will be removed.

I confirm it. If you are on Ubuntu 9.10 and running Emacs 23, install w3m-el-snapshot. It works. Thank you, MarcoPiedra

===w3m in Emacs23 (Cygwin)===
As with Debian and Ubuntu, above, the official w3m-el installed with Cygwin doesn't seem to work with Emacs 23, the error message being "Cannot open load file: w3m-e22". One solution is to get the latest emacs-w3m source code from CVS (see the instructions at http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/) and build and install it (see the README for instructions).
