Not sure where to put this:
  To work with multiple users on multiple computers in the same emacs (like some experimental complicated editors allow
  you to) just start a screen session with emacs on one of them and connect to it via ssh and the "-x" option of screen.
  Then you only need to coordinate who types when (should be easy if you have a voice or irc connection in another window)

Isn't this what RemoteDisplay does?

: Um, no?  If I understand it correctly, it allows you to open a frame on a remote display (provided you have the necessary X authorization credentials, of course).
