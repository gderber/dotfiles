Table of contents are now generated at the top of every page.
They link to each heading in the page.
Because of caching, the links will not work until the file is regenerated.
Files will need to be edited and saved for the links to work (unless a batch operation edit of all files is run).

Discussion of this feature was moved from EmacsWikiSuggestions to TableOfContentsDiscussion.
