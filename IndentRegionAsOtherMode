At times, when I'm working with an HTML file - an article about programming, for instance - I need to include a snippet of code inside a <pre> tag or a <code> tag. It's very annoying to have to indent that code by hand, and since the language may be anything from Hecl, to Erlang, to Java to C, I don't want to use something like two-mode-mode for Emacs, so I threw the following elisp together:

<pre>
(defun indent-region-as (other-mode)
  "Indent selected region as some other mode.  Used in order to indent source code contained within HTML."
  (interactive "aMode to use: ")

  (save-excursion
(let ((old-mode major-mode))
  (narrow-to-region (region-beginning) (region-end))
  (funcall other-mode)
  (indent-region (region-beginning) (region-end) nil)
  (funcall old-mode)))
  (widen))
</pre>
