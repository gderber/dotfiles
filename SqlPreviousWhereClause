Sometimes I am working on one record in a SQL buffer.  I might want to:

    select * from employees            where employee_id = 1;

and then I might want to:

    update employees set name = 'Eric' where employee_id = 1;

But I'm exceedingly lazy; I don't want to type that whole, big where clause again.  So I add this to my .emacs and now I can just type C-c w instead:

    (defun sql-previous-where-clause ()
      "Insert the previous where clause at point."
      (interactive)
      (let* ((previous-line (comint-previous-input-string 0))
              (case-fold-search nil)
              (where-index (string-match "where" previous-line)))
        (if where-index
          (insert-string (substring previous-line where-index nil)))))

    (add-hook 'sql-mode-hook
      (function (lambda ()
                  (local-set-key "\C-cw" 'sql-previous-where-clause))))
