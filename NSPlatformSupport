= NS Extended Platform Support Mode =

This package was part of the EmacsApp (Nextstep / Cocoa) port (see also EmacsForMacOS), which has since been integrated into Emacs 23 (in development).

The package is now available as "ns-platform-support.el" here:

http://braeburn.aquamacs.org/code/master/lisp/contrib/ns-platform-support.el


== Features ==

The package:

* tweaks the menus to be more platform compliant
* adds an entry for the Emacs.app manual to the Help menu
* sets scroll-preserve-screen-position and transient-mark-mode
* provides ns-grabenv, a function to import shell environment variables and paths


== Installation ==

To install, download the package and put it where Emacs can find it.  Then, add this code to your .emacs:

 (require 'ns-platform-support)
 (ns-extended-platform-support-mode 1)


== Suggestions, Comments ==

(please add here.)

How does this code differ from the one in the recent nswin.el?
