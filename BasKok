Hello,

My name is Bas Kok, you can reach me at bakotaco (~at~) gmail (~dot~) com, I also have some stuff at http://baskok.com . I am known as [::bas] on the irc.freenode.net #emacs channel. The first emacs I touched was GNU Emacs version 19.34 back in 1996.  But I've actually only recently been trying to participate more actively in Emacs bits and parts.  My current main interests are:

* extending CEDET with more languages
* fixing MultiTTYSupport on a variety of platforms so that it can be included in the main branch, eventhough rms says it will never be included.
* doing very very [ZoneMode random hacking]
