The following allows [[rcirc]] to handle, correctly and completely, escape sequences such as ##^C4This is blue^C## and ##This is ^Bbold^B.##. "Correct" and "complete" are defined in terms of the specification detailed [http://en.wikichip.org/wiki/irc/colors here], which originated with mIRC and became the de facto standard.
