The _Administration_ links on every page will now list _Nice index to all pages_
which links to http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?action=printable-index.
Not sure how useful this is.  Use the default [[CSS]] to show it in multiple columns.
For all the CSS authors out there, this is the addition I made:

    /* printable index */
    div.letter br { display: none; }
    div.letter h2 { clear: both; padding-top: 2ex; border-bottom: solid 1px; }
    div.letter > a { display: block; width: 40ex; float: left; border:none; }

I think this feature will need some more work for dates and non-ASCII first letters.
Without installing it, I know that I'll never work on it, however.
