Lisp:iproject.el


/This is an add-on library for/ ProjectBufferMode.

iproject stands for Interactive Project; based on the
project-buffer-mode; it provides an interactive way to create
projects.

== Quick Start ==

Simply creates a new project using `iproject-new' (C-x p n); then
add new projects using `iproject-add-project' (C-c n).

Once the project is created it is possible to add extra files to
the current project using `iproject-add-files-to-current-project'
(C-c +).

iproject will ask the user for command lines (with default values
based on the selected project type) to run each user action which
are: build/clean/run/debug and update.  These command lines will be
stored in the project but also saved with the project.

== To install it ==

Add the following line to your .emacs:

{{{
(require 'iproject)
(iproject-key-binding)
}}}
