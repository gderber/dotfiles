[[de:English]]
MoViMentMode is a minor mode that provides vi-like cursor movement that's easy on the fingers. With MoViMentMode enabled, you can move the cursor like so.

        M-l
   
   M-j       M-;
   
        M-k

Prefixing these keybindings with the *shift key* will move the cursor by line/page. Prefixing them with the *control key* will cause the cursor to 'jump' (see `mo-vi-ment-jump-length').

== Installation ==
Via MELPA:

   M-x package-install RET mo-vi-ment-mode

Or drop ##mo-vi-ment.el## somewhere in your load path, and add this to your ##.emacs.d/init.el## file -

   (require 'mo-vi-ment-mode)

== Usage ==
Enabling it -

   M-x mo-vi-ment-mode

For a more permanent solution, add this to your ##.emacs.d/init.el## file -

   (mo-vi-ment-mode 1)
