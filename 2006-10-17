Considerable changes have been made to the core pages of the Web site, including SiteMap and HowTo.  Some of these pages are radically changed and I'm sure there will be some hesitation about some of the changes.  However, I think these important parts of the Web site were stagnant and warranted improvement, especially the HowTo.  The HowTo became a list of everything rather than a list of would people typically needed.  I prefer "clicking" over "scrolling" for what I'm looking for, and organizing it by what task someone wishes to accomplish.  It probably still needs the work.

The useful description on using the site that appeared on the SiteMap has been moved to a new page, HowToNavigate.  That way this material can be centralized and referred to elsewhere.  I notice it duplicates WikiOrganization, but I think the latter describes the site from the perspective of editing and starting pages.

My hope is that these needed changes will blossom further improvements. -- AaronHawley
