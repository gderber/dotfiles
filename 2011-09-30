I think most Emacs users use Emacs at work -- see how traffic drops on the week ends? Check out how 75% of all traffic appears to be due to search engines. If you're interested in more details, let me know and I'll try and figure stuff out...
I don't know what happened on April 14. What a spike!
Something changed in August. Numbers appear to have made a jump. Do you have any idea what that was?
Apparently most Emacs users are from the USA, the UK, Germany, China and Japan.

After some clicking it appears that the jump is caused by increased search traffic. I wonder what happened in SEO-land.

Was April when there was buzz about Emacs being in the film Tron Legacy?  If only PlanetEmacsen had a history feature we could maybe figure it out. -- AaronHawley

Googling for Emacs 14 April 2011 leads me to this page: [http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2011/04/emacs-editor-11-tips-for-road-to.html Emacs Editor - 11 Tips For The Road To Mastery] but I can't imagine that blog having such clout considering the blinkenlichten ads. -- AlexSchroeder
