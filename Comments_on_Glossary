New to emacs and i l ove it  i have debian linux as my OS . 
My question is trying to understand downloading , pasting lisp code in the appropriate way. 
Am i suppose to paste any package i install into one file ?
Am i suppose to paste lisp in scratch?
I see all these neat packages and want to install them correctly

See InstallingPackages and CategoryPackaging. For smaller bits of lisp that aren't really full fledged packages, you can copy them into your init.el file. You can also copy to scratch and evaluate but then the effect won't last after restarting emacs.
