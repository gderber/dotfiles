2002-09-20 I am new to this community :-)

After browsing the wiki and finding good stuff around I feel like joining this.

I use GNU Emacs

== What I have done so far ==

; [http://www.skamphausen.de/cgi-bin/ska/XEmacs XEmacs Introduction]: written in the german language. I'd like to see transferred to and maintained at this wiki....
; [[ActiveMenu]]: written together with ClausBrunzema, gives you one more precious line of code.
; [http://www.skamphausen.de/cgi-bin/ska/mtorus MTorus]: [[MTorus]]  implements buffer cycling and the maintainance of different groups in which to cycle. This has been taken over and rewritten which makes the history somewhat obscure
; [[Taskjuggler]]: A (new) major mode for Taskjuggler-files.
; [http://www.skamphausen.de/cgi-bin/ska/track-scroll TrackScroll]: implements a similar feature like mouse-drag.el for XEmacs
; [http://www.skamphausen.de/cgi-bin/ska/highlight-context-line highlight-context-line]: was inspired by <nowiki>PostScript</nowiki> display programm gv: highlight the last visible line when scrolling in pagefuls. 
; [http://www.skamphausen.de/cgi-bin/ska/mouse-focus MouseFocus]: gives kind of a focus-follows-mouse policy for XEmacs-windows
; [http://www.skamphausen.de/cgi-bin/ska/swiss-move SwissMove]: means moving in smaller getting steps, thus navigating fast and precise in large files.
; [http://www.skamphausen.de/cgi-bin/ska/linmag-mode linmag-mode]: A major mode for writing articles for the (German) [http://www.linux-magazin.de Linux Magazin]

Add this to your library <code>swiss-move.el</code> to make it work with GNU Emacs:

  (unless (featurep 'xemacs)
    (defun line-number (&optional position)
      (count-lines (point-min) (or position (point)))))

After adding this to my copy, I noticed that you knew about this problem, but perhaps weren't sure how to fix it. Now you can correct this statement on your Web site:

: "This is NOT working in GNU Emacs. The function line-number is not working (at least in my pretty old GNU Emacs)."

Thanks for pointing out.  I'll put that code where it belongs. :-)

I don't know if the 1+ makes any difference here, but the documentation for count-lines says (at least in XEmacs, but I'm pretty sure I've seen these sentences in some (older?) version of GNU Emacs, too):

 NOTE: The expression to return the current line number is not obvious:

  (1+ (count-lines 1 (point-at-bol)))

I makes a difference: the first version doesn't work correctly when point is at bol, the second (documented) version does.  So I'll use something like

 (unless (featurep 'xemacs)
   (defun line-number (&optional position)
     (save-excursion
	(when position (goto-char position))
	(1+ (count-lines 1 (point-at-bol))))))

which is pretty close to XEmacs' definition of that function w/o narrowing. -- StefanKamphausen

; [http://www.skamphausen.de/cgi-bin/ska/tex-letter texletter.el]:  generates a menu from a directory full of LaTeX (letter) templates
(this is one of my very early elisp-works and thus quite simple)

== Clojure ==

My current obsession (2010) ist [ClojureMode Clojure].  If you're speaking German, may I humbly point you to the book that I am writing: [http://www.clojure-buch.de Deutsches Clojure Buch]

== Discussion or Something ==
Willkommen!  I would love to see content in other languages on the
wiki.  Adding links to OnlineResources is a first step.  There is also
a link to a French website on the Gnus category page.  Perhaps we
should start thinking about adding non-English pages to the wiki or
host non-English wikis on this server. -- AlexSchroeder
