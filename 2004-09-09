RichardStallman says on [[emacs-devel]]:

: I would like the Rmail changes to use mbox format to be installed
before the release.  Is anyone testing that yet?

Is anybody here using Rmail and volunteering to test the new Rmail stuff?
It resides on a /branch/, so just using EmacsCvs is not enough.
Please let us know on the mailing list.
