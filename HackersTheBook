From the WikiPedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution):

: ''Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution (ISBN 0385191952) is a book by Steven Levy about the hacker culture. It was published in 1984 in Garden City, New York by Anchor Press/Doubleday. Levy describes the people, the machines, and the events that defined the Hacker Culture and the Hacker Ethic, from the early mainframe hackers at MIT, to the self-made hardware hackers and game hackers. However since the book was written in the 1980s, there is no mention of the network hackers of the 1990s

The epilogue has the title ''The Last of the True Hackers'' and is dedicated to... RichardStallman!
