Per a recent change to add the emphasized bit: "Guile is in fact Scheme, '''which some people argue''' is a much simpler and cleaner dialect of Lisp than CommonLisp."

Arguably, anything is arguable, but a subset has fewer features and is unarguably simpler. Well, Guile isn't a subset of Lisp. 

But, seriously -- is there any dialect of List that isn't cleaner and simpler than CommonLisp?

Does there really need to be the anti-apple disclaimer in there? Would you see that on wikipedia?
