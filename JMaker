JMaker is part of the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/emhacks/ EMHACKS] project on Sourceforge.  Get it here:

JMaker automatically makes a makefile for JavaDevelopmentEnvironment projects.

If you get the error:

    wrong argument: symbolp, #<coding_system library>


Reset your EOL format:

    M-x customize-option RET jmaker-end-of-line-format RET

It's Unix by default, but it should really be "Default" by default. ;)

Make sure that your jde-compile-custom-classpath is set for your project.  JMaker will automagically add a "-classpath " to the javac calls
