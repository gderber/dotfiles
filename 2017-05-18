Welcome to the backup site!
This is a copy resurrected from backups.
More info on [https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2017-05-18_Emacs_Wiki_Down my blog].
For now, it's read-only until I've figured out what to do next.

OK, things seem to be working. Let's see whether git integration works? Remember the [[Emacsmirror]].

I think we're back! Thank you for your patience. :)

As for alternative channels: people can always send me mail (see my [https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/Contact Contact] page), of course. But where would you look for status updates? There's an Emacs Wiki page [https://plus.google.com/+EmacswikiOrg on Google+]. Perhaps I should just create a Mastodon account? ([https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2017-04-08_Mastodon Mastodon being the Twitter alternative].)
Any suggestions?
