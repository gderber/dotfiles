Editing Kuhn's example UTF-8-demo document demonstrates some of the issues
(when you've found out how to get utf-8 support in the first place).  There
are various problems even for locales like Latin-9 due to missing fundamental
features and lack of support for others.  Also I understand that Mule isn't
supported in a stable form under MS Windows.  -- Dave Love
