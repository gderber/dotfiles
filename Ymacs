[http://www.ymacs.org/ Ymacs] is an Emacs-like editor for the Web--that is,
it works in a browser.  Currently it's only tested with Firefox, and it's
known to have some minor issues on Mac OS X (most key bindings flash the
Edit or File menus, which seems to be a Macintosh “feature”).

Ymacs started out as an experiment and should still be considered so, but
it's currently quite functional.  The main goal of the project was to make
it pleasurable to write source code in the browser; using a <textarea> it's
far from convenient.

Features:

* many standard editing commands, such as text filling, movement by word, transposition etc.
* kill ring
* undo stack
* prefix keys (but no ESC for Meta yet, ALT should be used)
* split windows (they are called frames in Ymacs)
* multiple buffers
* autocompletion (dabbrev-expand)
* modeline and minibuffer (though minibuffer is not very functional for now, no M-x)
* interactive search
* syntax highlighting
* overlays, markers, point and mark
* transient region
* editing modes

Programming modes are provided for JavaScript, XML and Lisp -- providing
syntax highlighting and automatic indentation.
