'etalk' is an Emacs interface to the unix chatsystem called 'talk',
among other things.  That's what this page describes.

Talk, quite like VMS's PHONE, is an older chatting system that can be
used to reach users on remote hosts, if their system is running some
compatible ''daemon'', a program serving clients.  Several extended
variants of the BSD flavour exist. ''ntalk'', ''otalk'', ''ytalk'' and
''GNU Talk'' (gtalk) at least, and the KDE project has it's own
variant too, ''ktalk''.

Etalk in an interface to, and depends on the GNU Talk program
'''gtalk'''(1), which implements protocol versions 0 and 1, and
proposes 2.  Several features are available only when thge GNU Talk
deamon, '''gtalkd'''(8) is used.  Among these are the games, sending
files over the connection, auto-answer and so on.

There's a Debian package for etalk.  Last entry in changelog.Debian.gz
is dated October 2002, though.

At least for version 0.99, after loading etalk library, the Tools menu
gets an entry but it doesn't do anything.  In etalk buffers
<code>C-h</code> doesn't do what it usually does, but tells the other
end to move her image of your point backwatrds one step... there'll be
a ^H though on the local display though.
