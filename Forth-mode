== Support for Editing Forth Code ==

gforth.el provides auto-indent, documentation search and an interactive environment.

gforth.el is typically included with an install of [http://www.gnu.org/software/gforth gForth (GNU Forth)].

One online version is available at [http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth.el] - dated to 2003, which is not the most current.
There is 2008 version on github: [https://github.com/smtlaissezfaire/gforth.el/blob/master/gforth.el]

Historically, the mode was originally known as <code>forth.el</code> when started in 1988, but was since renamed.

== Basic Setup ==

    (autoload 'forth-mode "gforth.el")
    (autoload 'forth-block-mode "gforth.el")
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.fs$" . forth-mode))
