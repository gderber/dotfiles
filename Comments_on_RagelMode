Just started using that. And here are my 2 cents.
In order to use this as a proper module you need to add at top level:
<code>
(require 'mmm-mode) ;; for evaluating the module correct
</code>

and at the end:
<code>
(provide 'ragel-mode)
</code>

so at one's <code>.emacs</code> file can be loaded via 
<code>
(require 'ragel-mode)
</code>
