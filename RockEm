I’m on a quest for the perfect editor for programming :) right now I’m using emacs for programming in C++, and trying to get to a point where emacs and me will meet in the middle

One thing that I like on emacs is that it doesn't have antialiasing, so the text is clearer than any other editor on X

== Seinfeld Quote ==
This script loads a random quote from the series "Seinfeld", and show it in it's own buffer.
the quotes were fetch from [http://www.pkmeco.com/seinfeld/ SeinfeldQuotes]

http://elis.hostar.org/emacs2.jpg

The needed files are:

[[seinquote.el]]
[http://elis.hostar.org/seinquotes.txt seinquotes.txt]

to use it just add to your init file:
(require 'seinquote)

and in order to run it:
M-x seinquote

== Move lines Up and Down ==
Eclipse got this feature that when you press Alt with the up or down keys, 
it moves the current line accordingly. I find it very usable so I made these 


 (defun move-line-down()
   "move the current line down one line"
   (interactive)
   (setq previous-column (current-column))
   (progn
     (next-line)
     (transpose-lines 1)
     (previous-line)
     (move-to-column previous-column)))


 (defun move-line-up()
   "move the current line one line up"
   (interactive)
   (setq previous-column (current-column))
   (if (> (line-number-at-pos) (point-min))
      
   (progn
     (transpose-lines 1)
     (previous-line)
     (previous-line)
     (move-to-column previous-column))))

Welcome to the wiki! I must confess I enjoy my anti-aliasing on OSX -- I find it easier to read. -- AlexSchroeder
