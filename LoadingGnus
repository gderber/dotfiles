When you use Gnus from CVS, you have to add the Gnus Lisp directory to
the front of LoadPath, you have to add the Gnus Info files to your
private Info directory, and you have to add the correct autoloads.

Here's what I do.  After a CVS update, I run make.  This will compile
all the elisp files.  I keep Gnus in ~/elisp/gnus.

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/gnus/lisp")
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/gnus/contrib")
  (require 'gnus-load)
  (load-file "~/.gnus")

The reason I load ~/.gnus from my .emacs is because I define
PostingStyles there.  If I don't load ~/.gnus from ~/.emacs, then
using `C-x m' to send mail would use MessageMode (since I have loaded
"gnus-load"), but my PostingStyles will not be set.  ~/.gnus is only
loaded by Gnus -- not MessageMode.

As to the Info files, I put them in ~/info.  I edited ~/info/dir a
long time ago to include pointers to Gnus Info files.  In my
~/.bash_profile I prepend ~/info to the InfoPath environment variable.
