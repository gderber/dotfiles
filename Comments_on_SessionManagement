I tried desktopaid at April 2013 in 23.1.1. I downloaded the package from http://sourceforge.net/projects/desktopaid/.  
The package has desktopaid.elc but is compiled for older version of emacs so it wont work. 
Trying with desktopaid.el emacs opened with no error but i couldnt use it. Firstly i was getting an error about a missing .desktopaid folder, but even after it didnt work as expected.

I've been using workgroups (workgroups2) for the past few months and haven't looked back.
