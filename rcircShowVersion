This can be something useful sometimes to tell what you are proud user of :)

<pre>
(eval-after-load 'rcirc                                                                                                                          
  '(defun-rcirc-command sv (arg)                                                                                                                 
     "Inform other people of what IRC client you are using."                                                                                                                        
     (interactive "i")                                                                                                                           
     (rcirc-send-message process target (concat "Proud user of " rcirc-id-string))))
</pre>

Launch it in a [[rcirc]] buffer either with /sv or M-x rcirc-cmd-sv RET
