Zmacs is an Emacs for MIT-derived Lisp machines.  Initially it was called [[ZWEI]] and was written in ZetaLisp.  Later, KentPitman ported it to CommonLisp.

A copy of Zmacs' reference manual from the TI Explorer [WikiPedia:Lisp_Machine Lisp machine] is available at http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ti/explorer/2243192-0001A_Zmacs_Jun87.pdf (15MB).
