This may be of help if you are having trouble with Emacs
finding a font even though you have installed it correctly. On
my system Emacs could not find the fonts "Dai Banna SIL Book"
and "!BabelStone Phags-pa Book." The solution was to append
":style=Regular" to the names.  In the first case each font
style was in a separate file so this may have been the reason
this was necessary but I couldn't see any reason for it in the
second.

Is it possible to use Emacs fontsets outside Emacs? Having
spent a long time setting up the fonts as I want them in
Emacs, it strikes me that Emacs uses a fontset as if it were
one big unicode font. It would be nice if this "font" could
somehow be made available to other applications, perhaps by
making Emacs into a font server. Is there any way this could
be done?

I added variants for these two font names with ":style=Regular" on github. What platform are you running?

Also, I hope you installed from marmalade or github rather than the versions hosted on the wiki, as performance is improved.

As to using Emacs as a font server -- I suppose that fontsets are weighed down by historical considerations to which other applications would not be willing to subscribe.

If you have any other tips from your font configuration feel free to send them along for inclusion here or (better) file an issue on github.  I'm certain that many additional fonts ought to be included.

I basically have an ubuntu Linux system but is changed out of all recognition - I use stumpwm as my window manager and conkeror as my web browser as I try not to use the mouse if I can help it. I am using Emacs 24.2 and am using elpa repositories (gnu, marmalade and melpa) for extra packages when at all possible. So I amusing the marmalade version.

Many of my fonts are installed "globally" from Ubuntu packages and many are installed "locally" in my .fonts directory or subdirectories thereof. In the case of "Dai Banna SIL Book", I first downloaded it from the sil website and installed it "locally" and found Emacs could not recognise it. Then I discovered there was an official sil ppa with most of their fonts in it so I uninstalled the "local" version and installed the Ubuntu package. Unfortunately this made no difference but:

$ fc-list grep Banna

listed each variant Bold, Regular, Oblique etc. as if it were a different font with font name "Dai Banna SIL Book:style=Regular" etc.  That's why I tried appending ":style=Regular" to the font name and it worked and seems to make sense why it should. OTOH I have no idea why the same solution works for â€œBabelStone Phags-pa Book" but it does!

Incidentally once you know all the fonts can be found there seems no reason to have "Unicode Fonts Debug Availability" set to "on" and " Unicode Fonts Existence Checks" may as well be set to "Load All Fonts Without Checking." If this is done the package loads very fast and I can't see any reason to change these unless I do something to my font settings and want to debug the changes.

thanks for the feedback!

Is there any way to match the sizes of the various fonts?

I wanted to do the same thing. It seems like one should be able to append ":size=12" or similar to the font name, but it has no effect, for reasons I have not tracked down. 

Github issues are a better way to get hold of me, btw.
