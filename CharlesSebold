I have been using Emacs for nearly ten years.  I've had a patch accepted
to OrgMode, which will be part of Emacs 23!  I used to have time to help
out a bit on EmacsNewsgroups.

I have a web site of my own about various Emacs issues:

http://zancanda.staticcling.org/emacs

...which includes a feature which has been translated and published in a
few oriental countries, apparently, and which gained me a bit of
notoriety and a few flames:

My biggest current project is a Textile HTML generator written in Emacs
Lisp, whose home page can be found at
http://zancanda.staticcling.org/emacs/textile/ if you are curious.  1.0
hasn't been released yet but anything could happen if I got a few more
days to work on it.

I just started a new project to look up ESV Bible passages using the ESV
API in Emacs.  See EsvMode for more information.

I also just whipped up a MoinMoin to MediaWiki converter in Emacs.  See
MoinMoinToMediaWiki for more information.

I hate VBScript so I wrote a pseudo-REPL for it in Emacs; see
VbsReplMode.

In my life outside of Emacs, I am a computer system administrator in the
St. Louis, Missouri, USA area.
