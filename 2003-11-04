Andrew Choi resignes as Mac maintainer for Emacs.

: Perhaps it is best if I'm relieved from being the Mac maintainer.  I
program for the love of programming and not for any other reasons.
These responsibilities that seem to be expected of a maintainer do not
suit me.

This all started when he applied a 60 line patch sent by a contributor
(Nozomu Ando) and he was asked to revert the patch because the FSF had
not yet received any papers.

Once again we see that the requirement for legal papers is a barrier-to-entry
that does in fact prevent some people from helping out.  As Kim Storm justly
said a few hours later however:

: Sure, we all love programming -- and that's why it is so important that
we all do whatever we can to protect the freedom to do so.  
: For FSF/GNU projects like Emacs, the enforcement of the GPL and the
assignment of copyright to the FSF through legal papers is --
unfortunately -- the only way to do this.  

It's a difficult situation; we're being forced to do something nobody enjoys.
