Hi,

my name is Marco Dalla Stella and I'm an Italian developer.
I currently use Emacs both at work ([[EmacsW32]]) and at home (CarbonEmacsPackage) and I code mainly in Python, Java and Lisp.

It looks as if you never got a propper welcome! Let me welcome you now to the wiki. :)

Your last edit shows you changed from OCaml to Ruby and Haskell. All three languages were on my radar, but I was lazy and continued using Perl... I'm still waiting for Perl 6 I guess. But when I heard that the Perl 6 interpreter was written in Haskell, I started to doubt... -- AlexSchroeder
