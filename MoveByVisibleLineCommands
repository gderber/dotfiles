There are several packages that tries to help you move across visible instead of logical lines.
The two differ when Emacs display wraps lines (they never differ if Emacs display "truncates" lines).

* PhysicalLineMove - can be used with CuaMode
* VisibleLines - which are said to avoid some problem at buffer end that maybe the above package have (confirmed?), but is said to not work with CuaMode
* http://homepage1.nifty.com/bmonkey/emacs/elisp/screen-lines.el (added by [[EduardoOchs]])
* http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/90861 has another one.

I noticed a few bugs in PhysicalLineMove when moving in the buffer's last line.  VisibleLines does better ... -- [[nschum]]

...but physical-line is the only way I have found out, which works correctly with shift-up/down/end/home selections in cua mode (I tried also and visible-lines and screen-lines)

... and I am unable to find any bugs in the buffer's last line with PhysicalLineMove ...

I guess I should have documented the errors.  I just tested it again, and what I noticed is that it breaks ''move-end-of-line'' (stupid [AdvisingFunctions advices]!).  And when you do:

  <return> <return> x C-p C-n

at the end of the buffer, it rings the bell.  There might be more, but the last time I used it for a couple of hours before I started noticing. -- [[nschum]]

Thanks, I remember now I saw the the problems with ''move-end-of-line'' etc. I use this where I actually switched from ''move-beginning-of-line'' to ''beginning-of-line'' because of this:

  ;; Changed from move-beginning-of-line to beginning-of-line to support
  ;; physical-line-mode.
  (defun ourcomments-move-beginning-of-line(arg)
    "Move point to beginning of line or indentation.
  See `beginning-of-line' for ARG.

  If `physical-line-mode' is on then the visual line beginning is
  first tried."
    (interactive "p")
    (let ((pos (point)))
      (call-interactively 'beginning-of-line arg)
      (when (= pos (point))
        (skip-chars-forward " \t"))))
  (put 'ourcomments-move-beginning-of-line 'CUA 'move)

I do not know how to fix this problem. Do you have any idea? (Or are any of the other modes perhaps better?)

However the key sequence you entered above works without problem for me. Did you miss something?

There might be some problems with ''longlines-mode''.
I have not tried to find out since that mode has been a little bit problematic yet.
Are there any other corner cases?

I have not tried the other modes here because PhysicalLineMove works very well for me.
Could someone perhaps describe the CuaMode problem?

Are there any known problem with screen-lines.el?
