I'm Zachary !McGrew.

I usually hang out on [[Freenode]] with the name [::zmcgrew].

About me:
I use Emacs (Of the GNU variety -- Currently emacs-cvs) for just about everything I can.
I've been using Emacs on and off since about 2000, but started using as my main editor in 2007.

Current favorite addons:
* [[ERC]]
* [[Gnus]]
* OrgMode
* [[cheezburger]] (Shameless plug for something I wrote)
