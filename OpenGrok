Ever since I started using Emacs, I was looking for ways to navigate vast multi-language source code bases. And [http://opengrok.github.io/OpenGrok/ OpenGrok] is a decent solution to this problem ("wicked fast source browser"). This package is a first attempt to make !OpenGrok available to the Emacs user.

The output is not correctly separated by line, all output all in a single line. Thus the compilation-mode cannot understand.
