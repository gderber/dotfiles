EmacsMeteo is a general emacs interface to provide meteorologic data.
Although it is currently in alpha status, the code feels ready for public usage. Don't blame me if something does not work, blame the code instead ;).

* project page: http://gna.org/projects/emeteo/

At the moment, EmacsMeteo cannot provide a list of weather stations.
Instead, you need to find them on the web (or whatever) yourself and insert an appropriate URI.

== Obtaining emeteo ==

=== GnuArch archive ===
Check it out via our gnu arch archive: hroptatyr@gna.org--archive/emeteo--dev--1.0 at http://arch.gna.org/emeteo/archive 

* <code>tla register hroptatyr@gna.org--archive http://arch.gna.org/emeteo/archive</code>
* <code>tla get hroptatyr@gna.org--archive/emeteo--dev--1.0</code>

=== CVS ===

* <code>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gna.org:/cvs/emeteo co emeteo</code>

----

== Installing emeteo ==

Put in your .emacs:

    (require 'emeteo)

and some of the frontends, for example:

    (require 'emeteo-modeline)

Then <code>M-x emeteo-modeline RET</code>

----

== General usage ==

* To get some actual metar content you have to fiddle with <code>emeteo-data-sources</code> variable.
* For an example see http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/~freundt/.emeteo

----

== Further interfaces ==

Emeteo is intended to work as a backend.
Any actual functionality visible to the user is provided by frontend modules.

Currently there are following frontend modules:
* EmeteoEyecandy -- display status pictures in the modeline
* EmeteoGnus -- funs for generating X-Weather headers
* EmeteoModeline -- display regularly updated metar information in the emacs modeline
* EmeteoStations -- select metar sources from a list of icao and wmo weather stations
* EmeteoStorage -- save fetched metar data to file
