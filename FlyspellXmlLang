From the commentary:


Flyspell is an Emacs package that highlights misspelled words as
you type; for XML documents, this package will switch the current
language dictionary used by flyspell to match the language specified
by the xml:lang attribute of the current element.  The
ispell dictionary currently in force is shown in the modeline.
