The Emacsmirror *collects* Emacs Lisp packages and *distributes* them in
form of [[Git]] repositories --- one per package. The Emacsmirror can be
found [http://github.com/emacsmirror here] on github.

== Mirroring the Emacswiki ==

Most of the packages from the EmacsWiki are being mirrored just like packages
distributed elsewhere.  A few have have been left out for various reasons.

The respective repositories on the mirror contain the full history
beginning with the 30th August 2009 though the commit messages are just
timestamps. Since the 20th November 2011 they are potentially meaningful.

You might also be interested in the [[Git repository]] which mirrors all
pages and files from the Emacswiki.

== Contributing ==

You can contribute to the mirror by reporting new packages.

If you maintain some packages yourself please check if the *most* *recent*
versions are being mirrored.  (Some packages have been imported manually
because I could not find upstream.  In this case new versions won't be
mirrored automatically.)  Otherwise [mailto:jonas@emacsmirror.org inform]
me where they can be found.

Of course you don't actually need to be it's maintainer to report where
some missing package can be found.
