It's time for the irregular EmacsChannel ChatClient test again! Sending a CTCP VERSION to all of #emacs, we find the following:

    39 irssi/Irssi/MacIrssi
    38 xchat/XChat/X-Chat
    36 ERC
    11 rcirc
     5 ircII/EPIC4/EPIC5
     4 Circe 
     2 mIRC
     2 WeeChat
     2 Konversation
     1 you nosy fucker
     1 telnet
     1 nasrat
     1 kon^H^H^Htelnet powered [tm]
     1 dircproxy
     1 ctrlproxy
     1 SysReset
     1 Riece
     1 PieSpy
     1 Miranda
     1 Gaim
     1 Colloquy
     1 (* (! t) nil)

   152 Total

In relative numbers, it seems that [[ERC]] is gaining on the golden duo irssi/x-chat.
In addition to that, the ERC : [[rcirc]] ratio has improved as well: From 40:16 (2.5)
to 36:11 (3.3). ;)

Previous survey: [[2006-05-22]]; next survey: [[2007-12-21]].
