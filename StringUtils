String-manipulation utilities

==string-utils==

String-utils is a collection of functions for string manipulation.
This library has no user-level interface; it is only useful
for programming in Emacs Lisp.

The following functions are provided:

	string-utils-stringify-anything
	string-utils-has-darkspace-p
	string-utils-has-whitespace-p
	string-utils-trim-whitespace
	string-utils-compress-whitespace
	string-utils-string-repeat
	string-utils-escape-double-quotes
	string-utils-quotemeta
	string-utils-pad
	string-utils-pad-list
	string-utils-propertize-fillin

The most complex function is `string-utils-pad', the docstring
for which is reproduced below:

(string-utils-pad STR-VAL WIDTH &optional MODE CHAR THROW-ERROR)

Pad STR-VAL to WIDTH.

Optional MODE defaults to 'right, but may be 'left, 'center, or
an integer.

When MODE is 'left, padding characters are prepended.  When MODE
is 'center, padding characters are both appended and prepended so
that STR-VAL is centered within WIDTH.

When MODE is a positive integer, the behavior is fixed-position
padding.  Similar to 'center, padding may be added on the right
and on the left.  Exactly MODE-many padding characters are
added on the left before padding to the full WIDTH on the right.
When MODE is a negative integer, the behavior is the same, except
that MODE fixes the right-side padding.

Optional CHAR sets the padding character (defaults to space).

Optional THROW-ERROR throws an error if the length of STR-VAL
already exceeds WIDTH, or if the fixed-position padding requested
would cause the result to exceed WIDTH.  When THROW-ERROR is not
set (the default), a best-attempt result is always returned.

Tabs are expanded to spaces according to the value of
`tab-width'.

Returns a padded copy of string STR-VAL.
