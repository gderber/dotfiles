This package is an Emacs minor mode and allows you to edit one occurrence of
some text in a buffer (possibly narrowed) or region, and simultaneously have other occurrences
edited in the same way, with visual feedback as you type.

Normal scenario of Iedit mode is like:

* Highlight certain contents - by press C-;
   All occurrences of a symbol, string or a region in the buffer
   may be highlighted corresponding to current mark, point and prefix
   argument. Refer to the document of `iedit-mode' for details.

* Edit one of the occurrences
   The change is applied to other occurrences simultaneously.

* Finish - by pressing C-; again

This package also provides rectangle support with *visible rectangle*
highlighting, which is similar with cua mode rectangle support. But it's
lighter weight and uses Iedit mechanisms.

You can also use Iedit mode as a quick way to temporarily show only the
buffer lines that match the current text being edited.  This gives you the
effect of a temporary `keep-lines' or `occur'.  To get this effect, hit C-'
when in Iedit mode - it toggles hiding non-matching lines.

Renaming refactoring is convenient in Iedit mode

* The symbol under point is selected as occurrence by default and only complete
   symbols are matched

* With digit prefix argument 0, only symbols in current function are matched

* Restricting symbols in current region can be done by pressing C-; again

* Last renaming refactoring is remembered and can be applied to other buffers
   later

There are also some other facilities you may never think about.  Refer to the
document of function `iedit-mode' (C-h f iedit-mode RET) for more details.

-------------------
I hope this package could be extend to support html paired tag real-time rename.
