Google Chrome and Google Chromium are WebKit based browsers with a souped up JavaScript engine for running complex web-apps.

== Integrating with Emacs ==

You can use Emacs to edit textareas in the manner of It's All Text using the [[Edit with Emacs]] Chrom(ium) extension. It comes with its own elisp based "Edit Server" to respond to edit requests from Chrome without needing to use emacsclient.

Get it from [[https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ljobjlafonikaiipfkggjbhkghgicgoh|here]]

== Atomic Chrome for Emacs ==

The Atom fans have implemented an [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/atomic-chrome/lhaoghhllmiaaagaffababmkdllgfcmc extension]] to talk to  Chrome over a websocket. The same extension can be used to interface Chrome with Emacs. 

As mentioned on the [[https://github.com/alpha22jp/atomic-chrome github page]], there are a few advantages over [[Edit with Emacs]]

* The input on Emacs is reflected to the browser instantly and continuously.
* You can use both the browser and Emacs at the same time. They are updated to the same content bi-directionally.
* You can associate the mode based on the URL. e.g. gfm-mode for github.com, textile-mode for redmine, etc.

To complete the Emacs side of the setup, you need the atomic-chrome package which is available on melpa.
