== Interface Between Emacs and Command Line CD Players ==

Package to control command line CD players.  See the code Lisp:cdi.el.

Just run the `cdi-start' command, which will pop up a <code>*cdi*</code> buffer
with the status of the CD (eg Playing) and track/artist information.

Various functions are bound to keys in the <code>*cdi*</code> buffer, eg
<code>">"</code> is bound to `cdi-next-track' -- use <code>?</code> or
<code>C-h b</code> to find all the bindings.
