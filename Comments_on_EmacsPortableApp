This page is HUGE.

tl;dr: could we break it up?

Yes, there ARE other HUGE pages in this wiki. I also find them unnavigable.

And, yes, if I think it should be broken up, I could take that upon myself, I'm not asking someone else to do the labor.
I just don't want to do it and see it reverted a day later.

Please do break up larger pages!

If absolutely necessary, the wiki allows us to include ("transclude") pages and thus reassemble the original, huge page.
I don't see that necessity, but who knows... :)

??? Is this an artifact from somewhere else, or is this page likely to me auto-updated in the future?
