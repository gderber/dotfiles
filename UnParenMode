This minor mode toggles the display of parens.  While they are hidden
away, the buffer is read-only, because currently this code does not
really add and remove parens -- it just makes them invisible.  That
would be a nice feature, though.  At the moment, this minor mode is
mainly useful to show lisp code to non-lisp coders afraid of parens.

For a similar hack changing the string "lambda" to a real lambda, see
PrettyLambda.

For yet another similar hack that makes the parens less visible, see DimParentheses.
