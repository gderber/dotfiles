This page lists publications about Emacs on the Web and in print. CategoryDocumentation has information on the help and manuals in Emacs.

== Printed Manuals ==

The electronic manuals integrated in Emacs (EmacsLispIntro, EmacsLispReference, and EmacsManual) are also available in print from GnuPress, so you can read them without having to stare at a monitor. These books are excellent and, additionally, buying them supports the FreeSoftwareFoundation.

Some people, however, believe that the GnuFreeDocumentationLicense is not really "free" -- see EmacsManualLicense. For the EmacsWiki position on licensing, see the discussion started [[2003-11-16]]
about moving from the FDL to the current EmacsWiki license (see the footer of each page).

== O'Reilly's "Learning GNU Emacs" 2nd Edition ==


Published December 1996

When I first got started with emacs I picked up a copy of <i>Learning
GNU Emacs</i>, by Cameron, Rosenblatt & Raymond (it's published by
O'reilly press which most techies have heard of).  It's pretty well
laid out.  It won't teach you anything you couldn't find in the
electronic documentation, but it is useful nonetheless.

The first 5 chapters, or 150 pages, are dedicated to the basics of
using Emacs.  After that it's got a number of specialized sections
meant for different people.  In fact, in the preface the author
provides a guide for what people in different occupations may find
useful.  Topics include:

* Basic Editing
* Advanced Editing
* Email and Usenet
* Telnet, Ange-ftp, and W3 (How to access the 'net from inside Emacs)
* Basic Macros and LISP -- More Advanced Topics
* Using Emacs as an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
* Customizing Emacs

Personally, I liked the book.  It has a lot of screenshots and
diagrams so even if you're not on your box you can see what they're
talking about.  And it's written for non-techies.  My only real
complaint was that the author assumed the Meta key on your box was
ESC[0].  You probably won't read it completely through, as with most
computer books there will be some sections that just <i>won't</i>
apply to you.  But it is an invaluable reference -- if of course you
like paper editions.

If you're interested in buying a copy go to your favorite bookshops to
see if it might be useful.  There are also lots of used book shops
online.  You can get it for as little as $7 including shipping.  Good
luck!

[0] Emacs does many things through key bindings.  M-x means hit the
Meta key on your box along with the character x.  Likewise, C-x and
A-x means hit Control-x and Alt-x respectively.  Emacs decides which
key should be Meta when compiled.  Sometimes it decides that your meta
key should be the Alt key (the preferred method), the ESC key, or the
Windows key, or something else entirely.  It is possible to change the
Meta key to Alt and you should do that at your earliest possible
convenience if you have to hit ESC as your meta.

I found the section on Gnus especially helpful. -- Anonymous

Please do not add a link to online copies of this book, unless you are
certain that this publication is legal in at least Switzerland (where
I am) and Germany (where the server is).  Please link to the
appropriate note as well.  A simple
disclaimer will not do.

Aren't the authors (at least one of them) wiki users?  They can
tell us if we can (or can't) place this link here. (It's a very
interesting link!) -- JeanPhilippeTheberge

The authors of the book may not own the copyright.  They probably don't if the book was published in the US. -- Erika

== Emacs for Writers ==

Randall Wood has written [http://therandymon.com/woodnotes/emacs-for-writers/emacs-for-writers.html a short guide on how to use Emacs for writing text] (not code), which covers most functions appropriate for word processing, but it may be useful for beginners as well.

== The Craft of Text Editing ==

* TheCraftOfTextEditing -- a non-introductory book about text editors, specifically Emacs.

== Mastering Emacs ==

Book about basic, but also complex Emacs topics. Author's perspective is good for people coming from more recent editors, like Sublime text.

* https://www.masteringemacs.org/

== XEmacs auf Gut Deutsch ==

An introduction written in German with focus on XEmacs:

== Future books? ==

If anyone has any plans to write about the one true editor, I'd be interested in publishing books about emacs, especially an emacs tutorial or similar if it is under a free license.
