I have used Emacs since 2004.

Personal home page: http://web.psung.name/

Mainly I use Emacs to store notes with OrgMode; manage files with Dired and [[WDired]]; and edit Python, HTML, CSS, C, C++, Java, and Matlab/Octave code.

I wrote the [http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/tour/ Guided Tour of Emacs].

I contributed to [http://code.google.com/p/google-gtags/ Google GTags], an Emacs extension which provides TAGS functionality by querying a remote server (useful for large monolithic codebases).
