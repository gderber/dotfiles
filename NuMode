nu-mode plans to offer an ergonomic keybinding offering Emacs power to human beings. You save finger muscles, and memory muscles, too. The idea is to advertise Emacs functions.

"nu" is French for "bare". It is currently hosted on github, https://github.com/pyluyten/emacs-nu.
Manual is there, too : see doc / pdf : https://github.com/pyluyten/emacs-nu/blob/master/doc/nu.pdf

Main ideas are
- Modern keys : rely on standard C-x, C-c, C-v, C-z, C-f, C-r, C-s, C-o to cut, copy, paste, undo, find, replace, save or open.
- Prompts : Most of these keys work like a prefix : they will prompt for a key to determine the function : do you want to find a regexp, the end of buffer, jump to a char, go to line, or use ace-jump? That's all C-f.
- Paddle : Alt + I / J / K / L to move up left down right. U & O are backward, forward word.

90% of nu-mode is that simple! An .texi file was recently started.
