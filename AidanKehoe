Hi!

I'm here: http://www.parhasard.net/ or here: http://www.xemacs.org/People/aidan.kehoe/ .

Welcome to the wiki!  :) -- AlexSchroeder

: Danke, Alex :-) . -- AidanKehoe

Just to be clear---and this is, of course, not aimed at Alex---I think, after long consideration, that the X11 licence is a better licence than the GPL. I am thus not interested in talking about the minuti√¶ and jargon of the latter, and if I have done so on this wiki, it was to make the EmacsSchism page better reflect some of the [http://www.xemacs.org/ XEmacs] perspective, and not for the sake of it. 

This view does /not/ conflict with my working on [[XEmacs]].

Thank you for clearing this up, Aidan.  --AaronHawley.
