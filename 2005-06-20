After some prodding by [[twb]] on the EmacsChannel, I decided to look into
highlighting EmacsLisp on the wiki.  What I implemented right now is that
for pure EmacsLisp pages (the ones starting with ";;;" on the first line),
lisp highlighting will be used.

Example: [[css-mode.el]]

: Cool! Any chance this could also be applied to 1) the non-Wiki-page EmacsLisp files uploaded at ElispArea and 2) EmacsLisp snippets in the middle of a page -- say those that start with `<code>;;;</code>' or those between <code><pre></code> tags? I'm guessing no, but thought I'd ask. -- DrewAdams

What we need, now, is for somebody to hack the lisp file and turn it into
an EmacsLisp file!

Here's the lisp file:

* http://www.emacswiki.org/scripts/HFile/HFile_lisp.pm

It's converted from the PHP version, so it will probably be suboptimal.
It was written for an older version of the Beautifier module.  The
scheme file is supposed to be "newer":

* http://www.emacswiki.org/scripts/HFile/HFile_scheme.pm

Maybe there's some inspiration there.
You'll note that the colors have been hardcoded.  Yuck!
I think we'll have to work on the output module, too:

* http://www.emacswiki.org/scripts/Output/HTML.pm

Looks totally simple to me!

Here's the homepage of the Perl module:

* http://www.beautifier.org/

Once we're done, we might look into using a color-theme that suits the default
highlighting we're used to...
But that's for stage two, I think.  :)

: What of the perl situation: some Emacs-related source code files are in perl? -- AaronHawley

* [[emo2html.pl]]

Done!  A page starting with "#!/usr/bin/perl" will be considered Perl code and highlighted as such. -- AlexSchroeder

: Great.  The HTML is getting double-quoted. -- AaronHawley

Should be fixed. -- Alex

Happy useless facts for emacswiki.org:

                MSIE      15561    43%
             Firefox       9952    27%
             Unknown       6489    18%
            Netscape       1936     5%
              Safari       1085     3%
               Opera        670     1%
         AOL Browser         23     0%
                Lynx         10     0%

This uses CPAN's HTTP::!BrowserDetect module.

: Seems like the standard breakdown for web browser statistics of a technical Web site. I recall being a MSIE user in my lifetime.  I would crawl over FreeSoftware Web sites as drool came out the side of my mouth.  "Unknown" must be robots, no? -- AaronHawley

[new]
Unknown must be be bots and weirdo browsers I assume.  18% is a lot of robo traffic...  :( -- AlexSchroeder
