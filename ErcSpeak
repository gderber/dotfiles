See ErcExtraModules first if you use the version of ERC that comes with Emacs 22 and you don't have erc-speak.el.

This module enables Emacs to convert lines in ERC to speech.
EmacSpeak must be working to use this.

To install, add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'erc-speak)

It should not be confused with ErcSound.

*Questions:*

I have difficulties to get !ErcSpeak running. Where do I have to start?

I have read that erc-speak.el is in the distribution. Where do I find it on a Debian system?

* Try what's mentioned above (added to page after questions were asked), and if you still have problems you can ask on EmacsChannel or
the [http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/erc-discuss ERC mailing list].
