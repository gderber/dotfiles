tinytf.el is part of the TinyTools.


== Description ==

Tinytf can be used to write plain text files that are in form of natural "Technical documentation": Headings are placed to the right and standard text paragraphs at tab column 8. The format predates 1997 and later somewhere 2000 the [[AsciiDoc]] was based on similar ideas.

The design goal for  formatting syntax was to make it as natural as possible. The idea is that a document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

== Install ==

{{{
(autoload 'tinytf-mode "tinytf" "" t)
(autoload 'turn-on-tinytf-mode-maybe "tinytf" "" t)
(autoload 'tinytf-untabify-buffer "tinytf" "" t)
(autoload 'turn-on-tinytf-mode-maybe "tinytf" "" t)

(add-hook 'tinytf-:mode-define-keys-hook 'tinytf-mode-define-keys)

}}}

== Configuration ==

Add the following to your ~/.emacs InitFile file:

{{{
;; OPTIONAL
(setq tinytf-:mode-prefix-key "z")

;; OPTIONAL: Define additional Function-key shortcuts
(add-hook 'tinytf-:mode-define-keys-hook 'tinytf-mode-define-f-keys)

;; OPTIONAL: Convert file to spaces on C-x C-s
(add-hook 'write-file-hooks 'tinytf-untabify-buffer)

;; OPTIONAL: Auto-detect TF formatted text files
(add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'turn-on-tinytf-mode-maybe)
}}}

== Ideas ==

To attach your own custom CSS style sheet while converting to HTML,
add this line to the beginning of TF file. You write your own
<code>index.css</code> by modifying the default output of
`t2html.pl --help-css'.

  #T2HTML-OPTION --css-file=index.css
