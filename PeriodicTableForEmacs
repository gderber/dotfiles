== Periodic Table for Emacs ==

Package to display a periodic table in Emacs.  See the code Lisp:eperiodic.el.

The data were mostly derived from the GPeriodic package, available from
<http://gperiodic.seul.org/>.

Thanks are due to Kyle R. Burton <_mortis_@_voicenet_._com_> for making
available the raw data needed for this package.
