Hi Drew, is there a package repository that I can add to for Emacs 24.1+ so that I can install this and other .el modules you have on the Emacs Wiki via list-packages, thanks.

Hi Anonymous. Sorry, I don't know what you mean.
You can add packages to [[MELPA]], if you're looking for an [[ELPA]] repository.  Some of my code has already been added there, and I or someone else will probably add more  there in the future.  I have recently updated the file headers of my code to include ##Package-Requires##, with this in view.
