SrSpeedbar is a mode that makes [[SpeedBar]] show in the *Current Frame*, by SebastianRose. 

==Install==

: Put Lisp:sr-speedbar.el in your load-path, and add 
{{{
        (require 'sr-speedbar)
}}}
: in ~/.emacs


==Usage==

|| **sr-speedbar-open** || Open sr-speedbar window. ||
|| **sr-speedbar-close** || Close sr-speedbar window. ||

|| **sr-speedbar-refresh-turn-off** || Turn off refresh speedbar content. ||
|| **sr-speedbar-refresh-toggle** || Toggle refresh speedbar content. ||

How can I disable the icons? I only want ASCII, even in GUI Emacs.

Can I set the default font size for just the sr-speedbar buffer to something other than my other buffers/windows? I tried setting default-frame-alist as suggested by the speedbar-article, but that just caused all my frames to change font size whenever speedbar spawns. It wold be nice if sr-speedbar could default to a small font so that I can get a better overview over large code bases easily.

To answer my own question, I read the wikipage on [[FacesPerBuffer]] and came up with this:
{{{
(make-face 'speedbar-face)
(set-face-font 'speedbar-face "Inconsolata-12")
(setq speedbar-mode-hook '(lambda () (buffer-face-set 'speedbar-face)))
}}}
which solved my problem.

Even with (setq sr-speedbar-skip-other-window-p t) in .emacs file, the behavior of delete-other-windows is still weird in current  version of sr-speedbar.el. In detail, suppose 2 windows opened, in either of them ^ X 1, there is still chance to select the SPEEDBAR window to be active, which is not usually the user want -- the user want the original window be selected. After some experiment, I come up with following elisp code to further advice delete-other-windows not to select the SPEEDBAR window.

{{{
(defadvice delete-other-windows (after my-sr-speedbar-delete-other-window-advice activate)
  "Check whether we are in speedbar, if it is, jump to next window."
  (let ()
	(when (and (sr-speedbar-window-exist-p sr-speedbar-window)
               (eq sr-speedbar-window (selected-window)))
      (other-window 1)
	)))
(ad-enable-advice 'delete-other-windows 'after 'my-sr-speedbar-delete-other-window-advice)
(ad-activate 'delete-other-windows)
}}}

just place them after the elisp lines you use to load sr-speedbar.

How to integrate sr-speedbar with ERC's erc-speedbar-browser?

There is a bug when using multiple frames

C-x 5 2

C-x 5 o  (I'm in origial frame with speedbar)

C-x 5 o  (I'm in 2nd frame without speedbar)

Now when I page up and page down it also moves the first frame.

I don't get this when using regular speedbar. It seems like multiple sr-speedbars would be desired (one for each window).

With emacs 24.4+, ad-advised-definition-p function has been removed. You can add it back to fix the problem:
{{{
(defun ad-advised-definition-p (definition)
  "Return non-nil if DEFINITION was generated from advice information."
  (if (or (ad-lambda-p definition)
	  (macrop definition)
	  (ad-compiled-p definition))
      (let ((docstring (ad-docstring definition)))
	(and (stringp docstring)
	     (get-text-property 0 'dynamic-docstring-function docstring)))))
}}}

I'm not versed enough in emacs lisp to modify the sr-speedbar code to use some other function.

Hope it helps.

*Make Sr-speedbar open files in the next window, instead of in the previous window:*
{{{
(defun select-next-window ()
  (other-window 1))

(defun my-sr-speedbar-open-hook ()
  (add-hook 'speedbar-before-visiting-file-hook 'select-next-window t)
  (add-hook 'speedbar-before-visiting-tag-hook 'select-next-window t)
  )

(advice-add 'sr-speedbar-open :after #'my-sr-speedbar-open-hook)
}}}

*Sr-speedbar doesn't appear to control Speedbar:*

I had this problem using Emacs on OSX (25.1) and found the solution here: http://emacs-leuven.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#speedbar-frames

With a little modification from their code, put this in your init.el:
{{{
(require 'sr-speedbar)
;; fix so speedbar is in same window
(with-eval-after-load "speedbar"
  (autoload 'sr-speedbar-toggle "sr-speedbar" nil t)
  (global-set-key (kbd "s-s") 'sr-speedbar-toggle)
  )
}}}
