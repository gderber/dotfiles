EmacsHttpd is an HTTP server embedded in the Emacs. It supports GET
and HEAD requests for static and dynamic content. Since Emacs doesn't
support server sockets, you need to cheat a little and run it from a
service such as tcpserver or inetd. You can get better performance by
running a proxy server which forwards requests to a persistent emacs
instance using gnuserv; see the commentary for details.

To run this from a service such as inetd, using a
line such as the following in /etc/inetd.conf:

: ##8080 stream tcp nowait.10000 nobody /usr/bin/emacs emacs -batch -l /path/to/httpd.el -f httpd-serve##

To use tcpserver instead, invoke as

: ##/usr/bin/tcpserver 0 8080 /usr/bin/fixcrio /usr/bin/emacs -batch -l /path/to/httpd.el -f httpd-serve##
