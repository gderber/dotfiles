An Emacs convert from Vi.. Tried Viper on Emacs. I could not handle the fact that many of the packages seem to show a *little* behavioral quirks .. So, Gave up and learned the emacs key strokes. I love it.. 

I used to use XEmacs before but for some reason I some how felt emacs-21.1 was better and now living with it..

Now I am back on XEmacs. XEmacs seems to handle ClearType fonts correctly. GNUEmacs, well, doesn't.

http://www.gbvsoft.com/resource.html has a couple of tools for emacs. Will add more to it as time goes on. 

I have not been able to download any .el from this site.. Is there a place where I can see how to setup my browser (if it's my browser's problem) to download that thing?

: Hello and welcome.  Downloading files is notoriously difficult depending on your browser.  On Netscape and IE your best bet is to either click it, and if it is shown as a text file to use "Save As..." from the File menu, or to right-click on the link and choose "Save Link As..." from the context menu.

Thanks Alex. I tried everything but it just would not work. Would it be very hard to write some sort of a 
script within Wiki to show the el code within a Text box so that it can be copied over ..
I had similar problems while putting up the .el files on my site. So, I had to rename them as .el.txt and that solved the problem..
Oh well,.. 

: Hm... How about trying wget or something along these lines to retrieve the files?  Or (assuming you have the bandwidth) to check out the elisp archive as a .tar.gz file.  Try http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/list-archive.pl -- AlexSchroeder

That is an excellent idea. I could get that together. At last, I can actually access this stuff. I will publish this thing on the main page as well. Because, there might be others who might be having issues on downloading the data.

I have started hanging out at #emacs at IRC (InternetRelayChat) as gbvb or gbvb[home].. :)

Since I could not put this anywhere else, here is where it will probably endup.
This is a Poor mans "properties" mode. This is to highlight some of the stuff on the properties files usually used with Java development to store away some application specific entries.

   (define-generic-mode 'poor-man-properties-mode
  '("#") 
  '("=" "{" "}" "\\")
  '(("^\\(.*\\)[\t ]*=[\t ]*\\(.*\\)" 1 'font-lock-keyword-face   )("^\\(.*\\)[\t ]*=[\t ]*\\(.*\\)" 2 'font-lock-string-face ))
  '("\\.properties\\'")
  nil
  "Major mode for very simple properties highlighting.")

This is a GenericMode extension. so remember to add 'generic-x to your list of stuff loaded.
