Some of the pages on the wiki should be deleted at some point, but maybe not in the next month.  That's what this page is for. (and yes, it means in 2013, someone is going to have to find those pages and mark them for deletion manually.  either it's a small job, or it's a small job to write some code to do it.)

If you came to this page from a different page, that means the referring page is a candidate for deletion. Possible reasons why it wasn't deleted include:
* There is still some useful content on the page
* The page is part of an abandoned project that could be revived.
* The original contributor(s) cannot be contacted and we want to give them time to fix the page (or at least, comment on why it shouldn't be deleted).
