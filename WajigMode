"Wajig is an interface to many Debian administrative tasks. Written
in Python, wajig uses traditional Debian administration and user
tools including apt-get, dpkg, apt-cache, wget, and others. It is
intended to unify and simplify common administrative tasks." See
http://www.togaware.com/wajig/ for more infomation.

I write this package as a wrapper of wajig for Emacs. I love living
within Emacs. :-)

Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:

  (autoload 'wajig "wajig"
           "Create a *wajig* buffer." t)

Then, simply run `M-x wajig'.

Lastest version of this package could be found at: http://xwl.appspot.com.

Alternatively, you may try ga, or generic-apt, which is generic apt-get(as in Debian GNU/Linux) alike interfaces for various package management tools, such as apt-get(Debian), pkgsrc(NetBSD), fink(Mac OS X), etc.  It is very easy to add new backends.  You can get it from the same URL above.

== Features ==

; Ease of Typing:
  Most of wajig commands can be invoked by typing very few
  keys. e.g., in *wajig* buffer, `o' for `wajig show'.

; `ido-completing-read' Support:
  With the power of `ido-completing-read', you don't have to remember
  the full name of a package. It is also an ease of typing.

; Output Highlighting:
  Highlight command outputs. Make them look nicer.
