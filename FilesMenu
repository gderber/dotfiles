The buffer-menu command is nice, but all those non-file buffers can be distracting. This simple elisp function will run buffer-menu and show only buffers associated with files.

<pre>
(defun files-menu ()
  (interactive)
  (buffer-menu t))
</pre>

In the Jedit text editor, M-` lists open files. I found that I liked this key binding. To set this up do:

<pre>
(define-key global-map "\M-`" 'files-menu)
</pre>
