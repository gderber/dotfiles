A major mode for editing programs in the [http://dlang.org D Programming Language]. D is a modern replacement for C which attempts to rectify the mistakes made by C++ and Java.

== Current version ==

The current version of the d-mode, compatible with Emacs23 and Emacs24, can be found at its [https://github.com/Emacs-D-Mode-Maintainers/Emacs-D-Mode development page at Github].

== Older version ==

An older incarnation of d-mode, based on cc-mode 5.28, can be downloaded [http://home.comcast.net/~benhinkle/d-mode.zip here]. This version works on Emacs21, but does not work on Emacs22 (because Emacs22 comes with cc-mode 5.31).
