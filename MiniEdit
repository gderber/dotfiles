This little addition by 
DeepakGoel adds `C-M-eÂ´ (e for edit) to the minibuffer-local-map, and binds
it to the function miniedit.  This means that when you are in a
minibuffer, trying to enter something, you can type `C-M-e' to go do your
additions in a nice full buffer (with text mode) instead.  In
particular, inserting new lines and indenting is easy..  Helpful, for
instance, when editing BbdbMode notes, which tend to be multiline, right?

You can get it from here:
