The library [[uniquify]] overrides Emacs' default mechanism for making buffer names unique (using suffixes like ##<2>##, ##<3>## etc.) with a more sensible behaviour which use parts of the file names to make the buffer names distinguishable.

For instance, buffers visiting "/u/mernst/tmp/Makefile" and "/usr/projects/zaphod/Makefile" would be named "Makefile|tmp" and "Makefile|zaphod", respectively (instead of "Makefile" and "Makefile<2>"). Other buffer name styles are also available.  To enable this, ##(require 'uniquify)## then customize <tt>uniquify-buffer-name-style</tt>. (Run M-x customize-option)

[[uniquify]] is distributed with GnuEmacs.

==About the Unix uniq utility==

Note that the uniquify functions provided with Emacs, 
`uniquify-buffer-file-name',
`uniquify-rename-buffer',
`uniquify-rationalize-file-buffer-names',
deals with the problem of uniqueness of buffer names.
It has nothing to do with the problem of removing identical
adjacent lines in a given buffer.  See DuplicateLines if you want
a command which mimics the uniq utility found on Unix systems.
