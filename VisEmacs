From http://www.atnetsend.net/computing/VisEmacs :

VisEmacs is a VisualStudio add-on that allows Emacs to be integrated as the default text editor. It will be used instead of the Visual Studio built-in editor when you double-click on a file or press F4 after compiling (it will go to the proper line in the emacs buffer). A note: because the Visual Studio editor is not used, reverting buffers does not have to happen, as emacs is always used (which enables auto-save recovery features lost with auto-revert-mode).
