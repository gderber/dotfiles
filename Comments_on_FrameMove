The Framemove works for me when emacs is not in full screen, but when I switch to full screen it doesn't work in Ubuntu. It worked fine on Mac. Any idea of a work around???

Framemove works fine on Mac, but in Ubuntu it only works when the emacs frames are not full screen. What could be going on??

About point 4, moving frame (instead of focus), I've made some experiments based on modify-frame-parameters function, but it required some hacks to manage frame when they are in fullscreen and it's a bit slow, not sure I've done it the right way...

Experiment is here:
