= Foreword =

SubVersion, like other revision control systems starting with [[CVS]], can manage groups of files and entire directory trees, rather than just one file at a time like preceding systems like [[RCS]] and CSSC.  The design of Emacs' VersionControl mode unfortunately only supports these single-file operations.  PclCvs was the first Emacs mode to support aggregate operations on CVS files.  The following are modes that can also operate on many files in a SubVersion repository.

== Psvn ==

StefanReichoer provides a SubVersion mode called [::psvn].el, which is similar to [[pcvs]]/pcl-cvs for the ConcurrentVersionsSystem. The main advantages to this mode over the official mode is: 

# It is in the standard Subversion install and "blessed" by the Subversion maintainers since the pre-1.0 days.
# It can commit over more than one file at time.

You can find the very latest version at:

* http://www.xsteve.at/prg/emacs/psvn.el

The above version has this note at the top "This version is currently not under svn control", which means that it's newer than HEAD of trunk:

* http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/contrib/client-side/emacs/psvn.el

SurendraSinghi has confirmed that the psvn.el works with [[XEmacs]]

A version prepared for [[Marmalade]] is hosted on the Wiki's ElispArea:

* Lisp:psvn.el

=== Subversion 1.7 ===

In subversion 1.7 the format of the working copy was changed. Now there's only one .svn subdirectory in the root of the project. Unfortunately ##psvn## expects each directory to have a .svn subdirectory.

In this [http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2012-08/0195.shtml post] there's a patch to update HEAD of trunk to work with this new format. But as this is not the latest version, I've created this [[psvn.el.patch]] to work with [http://www.xsteve.at/prg/emacs/psvn.el the latest version] (timestamped "2012-03-26, 21:23:49").

Also in subversion 1.7 the output of modified externals has changed to include the full path rather the relative one, this confuses psvn. 
I've used a pre-parse hook to put output back into the expected format. If you don't use externals or edit them you don't need this.
{{{
(add-hook 'svn-pre-parse-status-hook 'svn-status-parse-fixup-externals-full-path)

(defun svn-status-parse-fixup-externals-full-path ()
 "Subversion 1.7 adds the full path to externals.  This
pre-parse hook fixes it up to look like pre-1.7, allowing
psvn to continue functioning as normal."
 (goto-char (point-min))
 (let (( search-string  (file-truename default-directory) ))
      (save-match-data
        (save-excursion
          (while (re-search-forward search-string (point-max) t)
          (replace-match "" nil nil)
          )))))
}}}



=== Usage ===

To check the status of a Subversion repository at `DIR':

  M-x svn-examine DIR RET

From inside the ##*svn-status*## buffer:

; `g': Refresh status of files shown.
; `U': Update files for currently examined Subversion repository.
; `C-u U REVISION RET': Update the files to `REVISION'.
; `M-- U': Update only marked files.
; `m': Mark file at point.
; `* %': Mark files by RegularExpression.
; `u': Unmark file at point.
; `c': Commit marked files or file file at point.
; `=': Run diff on the marked files or file at point.
; `C-u = REVISION RET': Run diff on the marked files or file at point against `REVISION'.
; `l': Display log for marked files or file at point.

From the ##*svn-log*## buffer:

; `RET': Visit the file at point.
; `=': View the diff for the revision at point.

For a more discursive treatment, see Ted Carnahan's [http://www.tedcarnahan.com/2008/10/24/a-brief-introduction-to-emacs-psvn/ A Brief Introduction to Emacs psvn].

For more details, read the commentary section at the top of the ##psvn.el##.

== Dsvn ==

DavidKÃ¥gedal contributed a Subversion mode called [::dsvn], which is also influenced by pcvs and psvn.  However, it can more efficiently work with large repositories containing many files and subdirectories.

* [http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=124678 dsvn.el -- an Emacs frontend to svn] -- initial announcement.

Download it from the "contributed" section of the official Subversion repository:

Question: How do I mark a directory for deletion if the directory is not listed in svn buffer (svn rm <dir> command)?
