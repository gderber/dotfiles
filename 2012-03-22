Hm, we seem to get a lot of vandalism. I locked the site for the moment. EmacsWikiAdministrators can lock and unlock the site via the _Administration_ link at the bottom, then _Password_ link to make sure you're logged in as an administrator, and once you are, the _Administration_ page will show a _Lock site_ or _Unlock site_ link.

(If you don't know what I'm talking about, check out [Self:action=rc;showedit=1;rollback=1 RecentChanges including rollbacks].)

*Update*: I added mail.wishmobile.ca to BannedHosts.
