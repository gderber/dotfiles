There are two different, unrelated sln-mode libraries: 
* an add-on library for ProjectBufferMode
* a major mode for editing Microsoft Visual Studio Solution (*.sln) files

Both have/are a file called sln-mode.el.  

== sln-mode being an add-on library for ProjectBufferMode ==
Lisp:sln-mode.el

/This is an add-on library for/ ProjectBufferMode.

This library provides a function to create a project-buffer extracting
the information from a SLN file and its associated VCPROJ.

=== Installation ===

sln-mode is an add-on to ProjectBufferMode; therefore you must first install ProjectBufferMode and then
add the following lines to your init file:
{{{
  (autoload 'find-sln "sln-mode")
}}}

`find-sln' is the command to execute to open a 'sln project'.

=== Documentation about the project-buffer-mode ===

Check ProjectBufferMode for more documentation about it.

=== Note about build / clean / run and debug actions ===

The command line are different between a 2005 and a 2008 project; by
default it will use the 2005 configuration mode; use the prefix
argument to switch to the 2008 mode.

===  It's a viewer ===

sln-mode is currently just a viewer. It doesn't currently have any
support for modifying/writting a SLN file.

Note that it doens't have to stay that way if people really need this
feature. ;-)


== sln-mode being a major mode for editing *.sln files ==
