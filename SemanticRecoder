Semantic Recoder (or SRecode) is a template manager and code generator that is a part of [[CEDET]].

SRecode is designed to be used in applications that need to generate code.  Templates can derive information from
the SemanticBovinator to write complex pieces of code with minimal user typing.

It is possible to read tags from a buffer using the Semantic, and then emit the same code definitions out again with SRecode.

Both the SemanticBovinator and SRecode analyze your code in an language independent way, SRecode applications can work in any language.

Tools in SRecode:

* Major mode for editing SRecode template files
* Minor mode for inserting SRecode templates
* Comment insert/rewrite - Reads your code and fills out the comment template from the local context.
* Add a field with get/set methods into a class
* Copy a tag from a language buffer (Such as Emacs lisp, C, whatever) and insert into a texinfo document using texinfo syntax.
