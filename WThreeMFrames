This page discusses the ability of a single emacs-w3m buffer to render html FRAME elements, ie. <FRAME>...</FRAME>. Don't confuse the content of this page with emacs-w3m ability to display different buffers and buffer groups in dedicated emacs frames (see page WThreeMTabsAndDisplayModes). 

== Rendering HTML Frames ==

If you want to render html frames within Emacs, you have to use w3mmee
rather than w3m -- w3mmee is w3m with multibyte encoding extension.
The problem seems to be that w3m and w3mmee behave differently with
the -dump_extra flag.

You will also need the utility mbconv (character encoding scheme
converter) for this to work out of the box -- this is provided by
either the libmoe1.5 or libmoe-dev package on Debian GNU/Linux
systems.

To use w3mmee/mbconv:

 (require 'executable)

 (let ((w3mmee (executable-find "w3mmee"))
       (mbconv (executable-find "mbconv")))
   (when (and w3mmee mbconv)
     (setq w3m-command w3mmee)))

 (require 'w3m)

You might also need to configure w3mmee such that "English" is set as
the "Language" in the "Character Encoding Settings" section of the
"Option Setting Panel".
