== Emmet ==

Zen Coding has been renamed to [http://emmet.io/ Emmet] and includes an expanded feature set.  See Shin Aoyama's [https://github.com/smihica/zencoding Github page] for a fork of Ron's repo that includes new Emmet features.

== zencoding-mode ==

A minor mode providing support for Zen Coding by producing HTML from CSS-like selectors. Example:

    a.x>b                    <a class="x"><b></b></a>
    a#q.x>b                  <a id="q" class="x"><b></b></a>
    a#q.x.y.z>b              <a id="q" class="x y z"><b></b></a>

Ron Panduwana is the current maintainer.
